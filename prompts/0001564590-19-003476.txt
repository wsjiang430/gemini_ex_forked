Item 1. Business. 
 MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (the “Company” or “MarketAxess”) operates a leading electronic trading platform that enables fixed-income market participants to efficiently trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments using our patented trading technology. Over 1,500 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms are active users of our trading platform, accessing global liquidity in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, emerging markets and high-yield bonds, European bonds, U.S. agency bonds, municipal bonds, leveraged loans, credit default swaps and other fixed-income securities. Through our Open Trading™ protocols, we execute bond trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in an all-to-all anonymous trading environment in which MarketAxess acts as the matched principal counterparty. We also offer a number of trading-related products and services, including: Composite+ pricing and other market data products to assist clients with trading decisions; auto-execution and other execution services for clients requiring specialized workflow solutions; connectivity solutions that facilitate straight-through processing; and technology services to optimize trading environments. Through our Trax® division, we also offer a range of pre- and post-trade services, including trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income and other products. 
 
Our platform’s innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics.  Our traditional Request-For-Quote (“RFQ”) model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. Our Open Trading protocols complement our RFQ model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an all-to-all trading environment. Clients can use our auto-execution technology with both our traditional RFQ and Open Trading protocols, thereby using rules-based execution to connect to diverse sources of liquidity while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors. Our platform also provides our broker-dealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. 
 Traditionally, bond trading has been a manual process, with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties. This traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixed-income securities, which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues. Many market participants also use e-mail and other electronic means of communication for trading these securities. While these electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with traditional bond trading methods, we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity, limited price transparency, significant transaction costs, compliance and regulatory challenges, and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time. Our platform’s functionality addresses many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone or via e-mail.
 Our services relating to trade execution range from providing a suite of trading protocols designed to fit the trading needs of our clients to innovative new trading technologies, such as auto-execution and the use of artificial intelligence, to assist our clients’ trading decisions. Trading protocols include single and multiple-dealer inquiries; list trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time; and swap trading, which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously, with payment based on the price differential of the bonds. Auto-execution allows clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders and our system will determine whether or not to execute a trade in accordance with the pre-defined parameters. Once a trade is completed on our platform, the broker-dealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated post-trade messaging, which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients.

We are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platform between institutional investor clients and broker-dealer clients; rather, we serve as an intermediary between broker-dealers and institutional investors, enabling them to meet, agree on a price and then transact directly with each other. However, in connection with our Open Trading protocols, we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching back-to-back trades which are then settled through a third-party clearing broker. In 2018, 22.0% of all MarketAxess platform volume was executed via Open Trading protocols, up from 15.9% in 2017.
 In recent years, corporate bond debt owned by institutional investors has increased, while the available base of capital for dealer market making has declined. Partly as a result of these trends, overall secondary turnover as a percentage of corporate debt outstanding has been falling, causing all market participants to look for new electronic trading solutions to improve liquidity and turnover. We have responded with a series of Open Trading protocols designed to allow our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an all-to-all trading environment.  During 2018, almost 1,000 participating client firms provided liquidity via our Open Trading solutions and we completed approximately 1.1 million Open Trading trades, an increase of 73.2% compared to 2017.
 Our broker-dealer clients accounted for approximately 97.7% of the underwriting of newly-issued U.S. corporate bonds and approximately 83.6% of the underwriting of newly issued European corporate bonds in 2018. Although institutional investors, specialist market-making firms, proprietary trading firms and other non-traditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platform through Open TradingTM, we believe these broker-dealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate. Secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security, without substantially affecting the price of the security. In addition to trading fixed-income securities by traditional means, including the telephone and e-mail, our broker-dealer clients use proprietary single-dealer systems and other trading platforms, as well as our electronic trading platform. 
 In 2018, our volume in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds represented approximately 18.1% of the total estimated U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume, as reported by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”). TRACE facilitates the mandatory reporting of over-the-counter (“OTC”) secondary market transactions in eligible fixed-income securities in the U.S., including trading between institutional investors and broker-dealers, as well as inter-dealer and retail trading. All broker-dealers that are FINRA member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to TRACE under a set of rules approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 
 Through our Trax® brand, we provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for European investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income products. In response to the pre-and post-trade transparency mandates from the recast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”) in Europe, Trax® has been authorized by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) as an Approved Publication Arrangement (“APA”) and an Approved Reporting Mechanism (“ARM”). In addition to its APA and ARM reporting services, Trax® has developed a comprehensive suite of value-add solutions for MiFID II, including pre-trade transparency services, systematic internaliser (“SI”) determination and monitoring, best execution reporting, commodity position reporting, data quality analysis and peer benchmarking.
 In 2018, 89.7% of our revenues were derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform and distribution fees that are billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. We also derive revenues from information services, post-trade services and other income. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses.
 Industry Background 
 Fixed-income securities are issued by corporations, governments and other entities, and pay a pre-set absolute or relative rate of return. As of September 30, 2018, the most recent date available, there were approximately $42.4 trillion principal amount of fixed-income securities outstanding in the U.S. market, including $9.2 trillion principal amount of U.S. corporate bonds, according to SIFMA. The estimated average daily trading volume of U.S. corporate bonds, as measured by TRACE, was $28.6 billion in 2018.  Primary dealer holdings of U.S. corporate bonds (investment-grade and high-yield) as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2018.  This represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by TRACE.

Prior to regulatory reforms, such as Basel III and regulations under The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), dealer balance sheets were relatively elastic, so dealers were able to facilitate trading in most fixed-income products without dramatic price moves. The regulatory reforms enacted after the global financial crisis resulted in greater capital and liquidity requirements for dealers, which impacted market liquidity and diminished risk appetite by market intermediaries. The Volcker Rule, which limits proprietary trading by banks, has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as market-makers. As a result, we believe market participants require different solutions to increase liquidity and we have responded with our Open Trading protocols, designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our electronic trading platform by allowing our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an all-to-all trading environment.
 Markets for Securities Traded on our Platform
 The U.S. corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities: investment-grade debt (so-called “high-grade”), which typically refers to debt rated BBB- or better by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or better by Moody’s Investor Service; debt rated below investment-grade (so-called “high-yield”), which typically refers to debt rated lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service; and debt convertible into equity (so-called “convertible debt”). We use the terms high-grade debt and investment-grade debt interchangeably in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 U.S. High-Grade Corporate Bond Market 
 The U.S. high-grade corporate bond market represents the largest subset of the U.S. corporate bond market. FINRA includes over 65,000 unique securities in the list of TRACE-eligible bonds, representing the majority of the daily trading volume of high-grade bonds.  According to SIFMA, U.S. high-grade corporate bond debt outstanding has increased approximately 19.6% from $7.7 trillion at year-end 2013 to $9.2 trillion at September 30, 2018. Over the last five years, high-grade corporate bond issuance was over $1 trillion each year, exceeding pre-financial crisis levels. Notwithstanding the growth in the total amount of debt outstanding, turnover (which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding for the bonds that traded) is below pre-credit crisis levels. The trading volume of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds as reported by TRACE increased to approximately $5.1 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $4.9 trillion and $4.6 trillion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We believe that the low level of turnover is an indicator of liquidity challenges in the credit markets.
 U.S. Crossover and High-Yield Bond Market 
 We define the high-yield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service. We define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment-grade by one agency but investment-grade by the other. The total annual amount of high-yield corporate bond issuance as reported by SIFMA decreased by 39.1% to $173.0 billion in 2018 from $284.9 billion in 2017. The average daily trading volume of high-yield bonds as measured by TRACE for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $8.0 billion compared to $8.2 billion and $8.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Emerging Markets Bond Market
 We define the emerging markets bond market generally to include U.S. dollar, Euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country. These issuers are typically located in Latin America, Asia, or Central and Eastern Europe. Examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey and Venezuela.
 The institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the high-yield and high-grade investment areas. Institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential. The average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt, as reported by the Emerging Markets Trade Association for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, the most recent date available, was $20.3 billion compared to $19.9 billion and $20.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 European Corporate Bond Market 
 The European corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products, issuers and currencies. We define the European corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to European investors, primarily bonds issued by European corporations, excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in Europe. Examples include: 

• | bonds issued by European corporations, denominated in any currency;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bonds generally denominated in Euros, U.S. dollars or British Pounds Sterling intended to be distributed to European investors, excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6


 
• | bonds issued by supra-national organizations (entities that include a number of central banks or government financial authorities, such as the World Bank), agencies and governments located in Europe, generally denominated in Euros, U.S. dollars or British Pounds Sterling, provided that such currency is not the currency of the country where the bond was issued; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | floating-rate notes issued by European corporations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the European corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the U.S. high-grade corporate bond market. The total amount of Euro denominated high-grade and high-yield bonds yearly issuance as reported by International Capital Markets Association decreased by 12.0% to $393.6 billion in 2018 from $447.4 billion in 2017. The average daily trading volume of European corporate bonds as estimated by Trax® for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $9.2 billion compared to $8.7 billion and $8.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 U.S. Agency Bond Market 
 We define the U.S. agency bond market to include debt issued by a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise. Some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The total amount of U.S. agency bonds outstanding was approximately $1.9 trillion as of September 30, 2018 as reported by SIFMA. The average daily trading volume of U.S. agency bonds (excluding mortgage-backed securities) as measured by TRACE was $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.8 billion and $5.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
U.S. Municipal Bond Market 
 Municipal bonds are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other governmental entities in the U.S. to fund day-to-day obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects, such as highways or water systems. Depending on the type of financing, payments of the principal and interest on a municipal bond may come from general revenues of the municipal issuer, specific tax receipts, revenues generated from a public project, or payments from private entities or from a combination of sources. In addition to being issued for many different purposes, municipal securities are also issued in many different forms, such as fixed rate, zero coupon or variable rate bonds. The interest paid on municipal securities is typically exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes as well. As of December 31, 2018, there were over 1.5 million different municipal bonds outstanding, in the total aggregate principal amount of more than $3.8 trillion. In 2018, the average daily trading volume of municipal bonds, excluding variable rate demand notes, as measured by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) was $6.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.5 billion and $7.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Credit Derivative Market 
 Credit derivatives are contracts that allow market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixed-income securities and other debt obligations without ownership of the underlying security. Among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the Dodd-Frank Act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions (“swaps”) through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities (“SEFs”), in each case, subject to certain key exceptions. We operate a swap execution facility pursuant to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (“CFTC”) rules and we list certain credit derivatives for trading by U.S. persons and other participants on our SEF.  The SEC has not yet finalized its rules for security-based SEFs that would govern the execution of single-name credit derivatives. 
 Post-Trade Reporting, Publishing and Matching Services
 In Europe, all firms regulated as “investment firms” under MiFID II are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction. This process is known as transaction reporting. Pursuant to the associated Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFIR”), the number of fields and the complexity of the information that must be reported to regulators was significantly enhanced. Firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an ARM. In addition, under MiFIR, all regulated investment firms are required to comply with pre- and post-trade transparency requirements pursuant to which quotes and trades must be made public subject to a system of waivers and deferrals. Firms are required to utilize an APA to comply with the post-trade transparency requirement. Trade matching enables counterparties to agree on the terms of a trade shortly after execution, reducing the risk of trade errors and fails during settlement.

Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths, including: 
Significant Trading Volumes with Participation by Leading Broker-Dealers and Institutional Investors 
 Our electronic trading platform provides access to the liquidity provided through the participation on our platform of over 1,500 active institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including substantially all of the leading broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading. We believe these broker-dealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, emerging markets and high-yield bonds, European high-grade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate. Our broker-dealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platform due to the presence on the platform of our large network of institutional investor clients and their ability to use our Open Trading protocols to help manage their risk, source liquidity, and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients. 
 As shown in the chart below, our total bond trading volume increased from $767.0 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2018.

Our adjusted estimated share of U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate bond volume from 2014 to 2018 is shown in the chart below: 


* We adjusted the reported U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes to eliminate the increased reporting of affiliate back-to-back trades by certain broker-dealers that occurred from April 2014 through October 2015 because we believe that the TRACE volume, as adjusted by us, provide a more accurate comparison to prior period reporting.  
 Execution Benefits to Clients 
 Benefits to Both Institutional Investor and Broker-Dealer Clients. We offer additional benefits over traditional fixed-income trading methods that are shared by both institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including: 
 Transparent Pricing on a Range of Securities. The price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from our broker-dealer clients’ inventory available on our platform, access to real-time pricing information and analytical tools available on our BondTicker® service ( including spread-to-Treasury data, search capabilities and independent third-party credit research) and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from all of our participating broker-dealer clients during the trade process on any debt security in our database of corporate bonds. Institutional investors and broker-dealer clients can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer, issue, rating, maturity, spread-to-Treasury, size and dealer providing the listing, in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually. Through our Open Trading protocols, participants may also elect to display live requests for bids or offers anonymously to all other users of our electronic trading platform in order to create broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increase the likelihood that the request results in a trade. We believe that broader participation in client inquiries will result in more trade matches and lower transaction costs. 
 Expanded Liquidity Pool. In the post-financial crisis years, liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised banks’ capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce market-making activities even as the buy side’s bond holdings have grown rapidly. In this environment, Open Trading, our fully electronic, all-to-all trading environment, has emerged as one solution to the post-crisis liquidity problem. As a result, the liquidity options for Open Trading participants are broader and more diverse compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties. The expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers, global dealers, regional dealers and specialist market-making and proprietary trading firms. During 2018, almost 1,000 unique liquidity providers participated in Open Trading. Open Trading improves the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches, move orders more efficiently, and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement.

Greater Trading Accuracy. Our electronic trading platform includes verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing, confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including real-time trade details, STP, account allocations, automated audit trails and trade detail matching. These verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond, at the agreed-upon price and size. Our platform assists our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader, and from the trader to back-office personnel. This automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems. 
 Efficient Risk Monitoring and Compliance. Institutional investors, broker-dealers and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixed-income trades. Our electronic trading platform offers both institutional investors and broker-dealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle. This enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability. Trade information, including time, price and spread-to-Treasury, is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform. This data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel. Importantly, we believe the automated audit trail, together with the competitive pricing and transaction cost analysis that is a feature of our electronic trading platform, gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients. 
Benefits to Institutional Investor Clients 
 We believe we provide numerous benefits to our institutional investor clients over traditional fixed-income trading methods, including: 
 Competitive Prices. By enabling institutional investors to simultaneously request bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients, we believe our electronic trading platform creates an environment that motivates our broker-dealer clients to provide competitive prices and gives institutional investors confidence that they are obtaining a competitive price. For typical MarketAxess multi-dealer corporate bond inquiries, the range of competitive spread-to-Treasury responses is approximately 13 basis points (a basis point is 1/100 of 1% in yield). As an example of the potential cost savings to institutional investors, a one basis point savings on a $1 million face amount trade of a bond with 10 years to maturity translates to aggregate savings of approximately $720. We believe our Open Trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our Open Trading participants to interact in an all-to-all trading environment, thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant, as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response. 
 Improved Cost Efficiency. We believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery. Single-security and multi-security (bid or offer lists) inquiries can be efficiently conducted with multiple broker-dealers. Our auto-execution technology uses rules-based execution logic to reduce trading inefficiencies and human errors while allowing traders to focus on higher-value trades. In addition, our BondTicker® service eliminates the need for manually-intensive phone calls or e-mail communications to gather, sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices. 
 Limited Information Leakage.  Our Open Trading protocols allow our institutional investor clients to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation through to settlement without limiting their number of potential trading counterparties.  In addition, our Private Axes® protocol allows participants to negotiate bilaterally on an anonymous basis to minimize information leakage when transacting in larger trade sizes. 
 Benefits to Broker-Dealer Clients 
 We also provide substantial benefits to our broker-dealer clients over traditional fixed-income trading methods, including: 
 Greater Sales Efficiency. We offer our broker-dealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients. Through this connectivity, our broker-dealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities. We also enable broker-dealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access. In addition, the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at broker-dealer firms to focus their efforts on higher value-added trades and more complex transactions. 
 More Efficient Inventory Management. The posting of inventory to, and the ability to respond to inquiries from, a broad pool of institutional investors, creates an increased opportunity for broker-dealers to identify demand for their inventory, particularly in less liquid securities. Broker-dealers are also increasingly turning toward Open Trading as a new source of liquidity as they manage their risk exposure. As a result, we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover by using our platform, which may limit credit exposure.

Growing, Comprehensive International Offering and Client Base
 Our platform provides global fixed-income market participants with trading functionality across global hard currency and local currency markets, connecting clients in over 50 countries to local and global dealers. MarketAxess has over 740 client firms located outside the U.S. that access our platform through our regulated venues in Europe, Asia and Latin America.  Our Open Trading functionality allows international clients to access cross-border liquidity with minimal ramp-up time or regulatory hurdles.
 The MarketAxess emerging markets trading platform also offers the most comprehensive offering for local currency bond trading across the Latin America, Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (“CEEMEA”), and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions.  Our platform provides clients with the ability to trade local currency debt denominated in over 25 local currencies with over 100 emerging market dealers.
 Full Trading Cycle Service Offerings 
 In addition to services directly related to the execution of trades, we offer our clients several other services throughout the trading cycle.  In the pre-trade period, our platform assists our participants by providing them with value-added services, such as real-time and historical trade price information, liquidity and turnover analytics, bond reference data and trade order matching alerts. Following the execution of a trade, our platform supports all of the essential tools and functionalities to enable our participants to realize the full benefits of electronic trading and demonstrate best execution, including real-time trade details, STP, account allocations, automated audit trails, regulatory trade reporting, trade detail matching, and transaction cost analysis. 
Robust, Scalable Technology 
 We have developed proprietary technology that is highly secure, fault-tolerant and provides adequate capacity for our current operations, as well as for substantial growth. Our highly scalable systems are designed to accommodate additional volume, products and clients with relatively little modification and low incremental costs. 
Proven Innovator with an Experienced Management Team 
 Since our inception, we have been an innovator in the fixed-income securities markets. The members of our management team average more than 20 years of experience in the securities industry. We have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of fixed-income trading, including the existing relationships between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients, while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional trading methods and improve liquidity. In recent years, MarketAxess has received industry recognition from key independent publications for its innovations and contributions to the fixed-income market.  For example, in 2018, Open Trading won the Waters Technology “Buy-Side Technology Award” for the Best Buy-Side Execution Venue, and Composite+ won the Risk “Market Technology Award” for the Electronic Trading Support Product of the Year and the Waters Technology “American Financial Technology Award” for the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technology Initiative. 
 Some of the innovations we have introduced to electronic trading include: 
  
• | the first multi-dealer disclosed trading platform for U.S. high-grade corporate bonds;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the first electronic Treasury benchmarking for U.S. high-grade corporate bond trades;

Independence 
 We believe the current regulatory environment creates competitive advantages for independent companies like us that are less prone to conflicts of interest. As an independent company, we are free to make business and trading protocol decisions with the best interests of both our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in mind. We are also able to attract industry leaders with valuable skills and insights to our independent Board of Directors. 
Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of information, trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are: 
Broaden Our Client Base in Our Existing Markets and Increase Penetration with Existing Clients
 We intend to use our broad network of over 1,500 active institutional investor and broker-dealer participants to drive more clients to our leading electronic fixed-income trading platform. The number of active participants on our platform has increased by over 90% since 2013.  We believe that the continued expansion of our client base will lead to even further increases in the liquidity available on our platform.  We expect that the increased liquidity on our platform and our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings will also help us deepen our market share with our existing clients across our product suite.  The number of clients trading three or more products on our platform has increased by 67.0% from 509 in 2014 to 850 in 2018. Last, we will seek to increase our international presence by increasing the number of firms located outside the U.S. that access our platform through our venues in Europe, Asia and Latin America, increasing the number of local currencies available for trading on our platform; and, subject to regulatory requirements, increasing the number of countries in which we can offer our platform.  
Enhance the Liquidity of Securities Traded on Our Platform by Leveraging our Client Network and Open Trading Protocols 
 We aim to increase the secondary market liquidity on our trading platform by deploying innovative technology solutions designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our platform and to address different trade sizes, bond liquidity characteristics and trading preferences.  Our Open Trading protocols exponentially increase the potential trading counterparties by allowing broker-dealers and institutional investors to interact in an all-to-all trading environment. During 2018, our clients executed approximately 1.1 million trades using our Open Trading solutions, representing 22.0% of the total trading volume on our platform.  In recent years, we have also significantly increased the number of participants that provide bond prices to our platform via an algorithm, which has helped increase the number of price responses on our platform by 142.1% from 2015 to 2018. We intend to continue to improve the liquidity of bonds on our platform by increasing the number of connections we have with algorithmic trading firms. We also believe that the combination of Open Trading and our vast client network provides the basis for MarketAxess to deliver meaningful cross-border liquidity or enter into new markets where liquidity is scarcer, such as municipal bonds.  
 Continue to Develop Innovative Next-Generation Technologies that will Allow Our Clients to Further Automate and Improve the Performance of their Trading Desks 
 We believe that the increased adoption of next-generation trading technologies by both dealer and investor clients will create improved liquidity, enhanced trading efficiencies and the ability to identify trends within the bond market.  In recent years, we have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machine-learning, automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients, while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors.  For example, clients can use our rules-based auto-execution technology with both our traditional RFQ protocol and Open Trading to automatically execute trades meeting defined parameters with diverse sources of liquidity.  Our Composite+ pricing algorithm uses machine-learning to generate near real-time prices for over 25,000 corporate bonds based on a variety of data inputs, and our Like Bonds product uses a data-driven methodology to help clients find liquid, tradable alternatives to illiquid bonds.  We intend to continue to invest in and develop advanced technologies such as these that will make MarketAxess an increasingly valuable part of our clients’ trading decisions and workflows.

Expand and Strengthen our Trade-Related Service, Data and Analytical Offerings Throughout the Trading Cycle
We plan to expand and strengthen our existing service, data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle so that MarketAxess is more fully integrated into the workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. In the pre-trade period, we intend to continue to enhance the value of our information and analytical offerings, including the content and capabilities of BondTicker®, Axess All® and Composite+. We plan to enhance and expand the usage of LiquidityBridge®, our execution management system (EMS) service that allows users to manage and facilitate the complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms, including the MarketAxess system. We also intend to augment our post-trade matching and regulatory reporting services provided by our Trax® brand in Europe that enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to MiFID II. As the use of our pre- and post-trade services and products grow, we believe that MarketAxess will become further entrenched as a value-added resource to our clients at each stage of the trading cycle, which we believe will further increase the attractiveness and use of our trading platform.
Pursue Select Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances 
 We continually evaluate opportunities to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies, that will enable us to enter new markets, provide new products or services, or otherwise enhance the value of our platform and existing trade-related services to our clients. In recent years, we entered into, and expanded, a strategic alliance with BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) to combine BlackRock’s order flow with our Open Trading solution to improve the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants. 
Key Products and Services
 MarketAxess offers the following key products and services to its clients:

 Over 70 broker-dealer clients and over 300 institutional investor clients use our platform to trade municipal bonds. We offer trading for both taxable and non-taxable municipal bonds. Our 2018 trading volume in the U.S. municipal bond market was $5.9 billion.
Credit Derivatives 
 We offer a range of functionality for electronic trading of CFTC-regulated credit derivatives instruments on our SEF in compliance with the CFTC’s requirements. This includes an RFQ system that allows participants to send anonymous or disclosed RFQs, as well as an order book, which enables market participants to trade anonymously with all other market participants. Approximately 40 active market participants use our SEF to trade credit derivative indices and credit options. Our 2018 credit derivatives trading volume was $93.4 billion.
Open Trading Functionality 
 We offer a series of Open Trading protocols that allows our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to interact in an all-to-all trading environment. Our Market List functionality provides our Open Trading participants with the ability to display live requests for bids and offers anonymously to the entire MarketAxess trading community, thereby creating broader visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increasing the likelihood that the request results in a completed trade.   Public Axes™ is an order book-style price discovery process that gives clients the ability to view anonymous or disclosed indications of interest from the inventory on our platform. Through the aggregated indication of interest inventory, clients can search for bonds of interest and engage in electronic transactions.  For block-sized trades, clients may use our Private Axes® functionality, a protocol that allows participants to anonymously negotiate round lots (greater than $1.0 million) and block trades to minimize information leakage. We offer Open Trading protocols for all of our key trading products, including corporate, municipal and emerging market bonds. Bond trades executed pursuant to any of our anonymous Open Trading protocol are conducted with MarketAxess on a matched principal basis.
Post-Trade Reporting, Publishing and Matching Services
 In Europe, all firms regulated as “investment firms” under MiFID II are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction. This process is known as transaction reporting. Pursuant to MiFIR, the number of fields and the complexity of the information that must be reported to regulators was significantly enhanced. Firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an ARM, such as our Trax® ARM, to validate and submit such reports. In the U.K., covered transactions are reported to the FCA.
 In addition, under MiFIR, all regulated investment firms are required to comply with pre- and post-trade transparency requirements pursuant to which quotes and trades must be made public subject to a system of waivers and deferrals. Firms are required to utilize an APA, such as our Trax® APA, to comply with the post trade transparency requirement and, although optional, many firms also utilize a third party provider, such as Trax®, to satisfy the pre trade transparency requirement. The Trax® Transparency Solution and the Trax® APA trade reporting solution are available through the Trax Insight™ platform, offering our clients a pre- and post-trade transparency solution, including APA trade reporting, quote publication, SI determination and instrument liquidity classification. Trax® also offers a commodity position reporting service to assist firms in compliance with the commodity derivative position limit reporting requirements of MiFID II.
 Trade matching enables counterparties to agree on the terms of a trade shortly after execution, reducing the risk of trade errors and fails during settlement. Trax® Match is our near real-time post-trade matching and exception management tool which covers a broad range of securities, including fixed-income and equities. Trax® Match helps our clients to mitigate their operational risk, improve STP and efficiency, address the complexities of MiFID II and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation and confirm all economic details within minutes of execution. 
 Trax® has over 170 clients, including broker-dealers, hedge funds and investment banks. The Trax® platform processed approximately 0.9 billion transactions in 2018.

Information Services 
 In the pre-trade period, our platform assists our participants by providing them with value-added services, such as real time and historical trade price information, intelligent Composite+ pricing, BondTicker®, liquidity and turnover analytics, bond reference data and trade order matching alerts. The information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions. Our electronic trading platform allows institutional investors to compile, sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual information-gathering process or other electronic services. 
 Our Composite+ pricing algorithm generates near real-time prices for over 25,000 corporate bonds based on a variety of data inputs, including feeds from our trading platform, our Trax® post-trade service and TRACE.  Composite+ is used by clients as a pre-trade reference price to enhance trading outcomes and transaction cost analysis.  Composite+ can be combined with our auto-execution service, providing clients with an alert if a response is “off market”. 
 Through our Trax® brand, we provide a range of information solutions for financial services firms, utilizing quotes contributed by market participants and leveraging data from our post-trade services business. Axess All®, the first intra-day trade tape for the European fixed-income market, is sourced from over 30,000 bond transactions processed daily by Trax® and includes aggregated volume and pricing for the most actively traded European fixed-income instruments. We also provide market participants with access to pricing, liquidity and volume data on over 40,000 unique fixed-income securities and securities reference data for approximately 300,000 fixed-income securities. 
 BondTicker® provides real-time TRACE data and enhances it with MarketAxess trade data and analytical tools in order to provide professional market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond price information with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available. The data includes trade time and sales information, including execution prices, as well as MarketAxess-estimated spread-to-Treasuries, for trades disseminated by the TRACE system. The data also includes actual execution prices and spread-to-Treasury levels for U.S. high-grade corporate bond trades executed on the MarketAxess platform. BondTicker® is currently the source of corporate bond trading information for The Wall Street Journal in the U.S.
BondTicker® allows institutional investors to search for and sort bonds based upon specific criteria, such as volume, time/date of transaction, spread change, issuer or security. This search function allows institutional investors to compile information relating to potential securities trades in a fraction of the time that it takes to manually compile this information from disparate sources or other electronic databases, including direct TRACE feeds and European pricing information provided by Trax’s end-of-day pricing feed. 
 BondTicker® is integrated directly into the MarketAxess electronic trading platform and can be seamlessly accessed, either when viewing securities inventory or when launching an inquiry. BondTicker® is also available through the internet for non-trading professional market participants, including, among others, research analysts and rating agencies, who can log in and access the information via a browser-based interface. 
 We also offer a set of tools that analyze credit trading activity for institutional investor clients. These tools utilize extensive amounts of market data and have a flexible interface to run and save in a variety of formats, depending on the business purpose. Further, we provide extensive client-specific reports that measure trading performance on our electronic trading platform, including reports for the value of price discovery from multiple dealers, the cost savings generated from Open Trading participation and transaction cost analysis.
 LiquidityBridge® is our execution management system (“EMS”) service that allows users to manage and facilitate the complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms, including the MarketAxess system. LiquidityBridge® brings together real-time comparison and execution of bond prices across multiple sectors allowing users to rapidly react to trading opportunities. Clients can also automatically generate custom pricing and distribute inventory to any destination. By using a library of standard adaptors, LiquidityBridge® can be deployed across a variety of fixed-income markets.

Straight-Through Processing and APIs
 Straight-through processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from end-to-end — trade execution, confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention. We provide our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with a range of tools that facilitate straight-through processing, including order upload, easy-to-use online allocation tools and pre- and post-trade messaging features that enable our clients to communicate electronically between their front- and back-office systems. Our straight-through processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of our clients and allow them to integrate their order, portfolio management and accounting systems in real time. We continue to build industry partnerships to assist our clients in creating connectivity throughout the trade cycle. Through these partnerships, we are increasingly providing solutions that can quickly be deployed within our clients’ trading operations. 
 Usage of our straight-through processing tools increased significantly during the last several years. We maintained over 1,100 STP connections as of December 31, 2018. In addition, many of our clients use our Application Programming Interface (“API”) services for pre-trade, trade negotiation and post-trade services to improve efficiency and reduce errors in processing. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies. Our sales force is responsible for client acquisition activity and for increasing use of our trading platform and information and post-trade services by our existing clients. Their goal is to train and support existing and new clients on how to use our system and to educate them as to the benefits of utilizing an electronic fixed-income trading platform. We employ various strategies, including advertising, direct marketing, promotional mailings, and participation in industry conferences and media engagement, to increase awareness of our brand and our electronic trading platform. For example, we have worked with The Wall Street Journal to establish BondTicker® as the source of information for its daily corporate bond and high-yield tables. A similar process also exists for our Trax® post-trade business, employing both direct and indirect sales methods. 
 Competition 
 The industry that we participate in is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We face four main areas of competition: 
  
• | Telephone and Direct Electronic Communications — We compete with bond trading business conducted over the telephone, e-mail or instant messaging between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients. Institutional investors have historically purchased fixed-income securities by telephoning or otherwise communicating via e-mail or instant messaging with bond sales professionals at one or more broker-dealers and inquiring about the price and availability of individual bonds. This remains the manner in which the majority of corporate bond volumes are still traded between institutional investors and broker-dealers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other electronic trading platforms — There are numerous other electronic trading platforms currently in existence, including several that have only commenced operations in the last few years. Among others, Bloomberg and Tradeweb operate multi-dealer to institutional investor trading platforms for both fixed-income securities and derivatives. Several registered alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including two ATSs recently acquired by Intercontinental Exchange, also offer exchange-style trading for corporate and municipal bonds, particularly for smaller trade sizes. In addition, some broker-dealers and institutional investors operate, or have invested in, proprietary electronic trading systems or information networks that enable institutional investors to trade directly with a broker-dealer, and/or with other institutional investors over an electronic medium. As we expand our business into new products, we will likely come into more direct competition with other electronic trading platforms or firms offering traditional services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market data and information vendors — Several large market data and information providers currently have a data and analytics relationship with virtually every institutional firm. Some of these entities, including Bloomberg and Intercontinental Exchange, currently offer varying forms of electronic trading of fixed-income securities. Some of these entities have announced their intention to expand their electronic trading platforms or to develop new platforms. These entities are currently direct competitors to our information services business and already are or may in the future become direct competitors to our electronic trading platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other approved regulatory mechanisms — We compete with other approved regulatory mechanisms in Europe that have the FCA’s ARM and APA designations, such as the London Stock Exchange’s UnaVista and Tradeweb, to provide post-trade matching and regulatory transaction reporting and transparency services to European clients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


Competitors, including companies in which some of our clients have invested, have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us. Furthermore, some of our clients have made, and may in the future continue to make, investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us. 
 In general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors, including: 
  
• | broad network of broker-dealer and institutional investor clients using our electronic trading platform;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liquidity provided by the participating broker-dealers and, to a growing extent, by other institutional investors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | magnitude and frequency of price improvement;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | enhancing the quality and speed of execution;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | compliance benefits;
--+---------------------


• | total transaction costs;
--+-------------------------


• | technology capabilities, including the reliability, security, and ease of use of our electronic trading platform; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | range of products, protocols and services offered.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors. 
 Our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems. We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs. 
 
Our broker-dealer clients have invested in building API’s with us for inventory contributions, electronic trading, government bond benchmark pricing and post-trade messaging. We believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our broker-dealer clients, increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to use our services; however, the contractual obligations of such clients are non-exclusive. See the Risk Factor captioned “We are dependent on our broker-dealer clients, who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or third-party platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients.”
 Furthermore, a significant number of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platform and their order, portfolio management and accounting systems. We believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry. 
 Technology 
 The design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy. Our electronic trading platform has been designed with secure, scalable client-server architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed, reliability and fault tolerance. The platform is built on industry-standard technologies and has been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume. 
 All critical server-side components, primarily our networks, application servers and databases, have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails. This offers fully redundant system capacity to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure. We also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure. The majority of our broker-dealer clients and a significant number of our institutional investor clients have redundant dedicated high-speed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. Our security measures include industry-standard communications encryption. 
 We have designed our application with an easy-to-use, Windows-based interface. Our clients are able to access our electronic trading platform through a secure, single sign-on. Clients are also able to execute transactions over our platform directly from their order management systems. We provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. Our software code, elements of our electronic trading platform, website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws. We have been issued 13 patents covering our most significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology. 
 17


The written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets. Examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements, employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements, and agreements with customers, contractors and strategic partners. Other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights. 
 
We have obtained U.S. federal registration of the MarketAxess® name, and our new logo is pending registration in the U.S. The same mark and logo have been registered or are pending registration in several foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have obtained U.S. federal registration for the marks AutoSpotting®, FrontPage®, Actives®, DealerAxess®, Trax®, Trade ON®, LiquidityBridge®, BondTicker®, Axess All®, Private Axes®, and associated designs and have a number of other registered trademarks and service marks. Open TradingTM, MarketAxess Bid-Ask Spread Index (BASI)TM, Mid-HedgingTM and Now You’re In The MarketTM are trademarks we use, but they have not been registered or are pending registration in the U.S.
 In addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments, frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position. 
 Government Regulation 
 The securities industry and financial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets. Our active broker-dealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations. 
 Regulation of the U.S. Securities Industry and Broker-Dealers 
 In the U.S., the SEC is the governmental agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. One of our U.S. subsidiaries, MarketAxess Corporation, is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and also has a SEC-registered alternative trading system. MarketAxess Corporation is also a member of FINRA and registered with the MSRB, self-regulatory organizations that regulate broker-dealers in the U.S. In addition, MarketAxess Corporation is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which provides certain protection for clients’ accounts in the event of a liquidation of a broker-dealer to the extent any such accounts are held by the broker-dealer. 
 Additionally, MarketAxess Corporation is registered with certain states and the District of Columbia as a broker-dealer. The individual states and the District of Columbia are responsible for the administration of their respective “blue sky” laws, rules and regulations. 
 MarketAxess SEF Corporation, our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, operates as a SEF for the trading of certain credit derivatives subject to the CFTC’s jurisdiction, including certain index swaps subject to the CFTC’s ‘made available for trade’ determination that are required to be executed on a SEF or regulated exchange. 
 Various rules promulgated since the financial crisis have adversely affected our bank-affiliated broker-dealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixed-income securities, which could negatively impact the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform. For example, while the Volcker Rule does not apply directly to us, the Volcker Rule bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates. In addition, enhanced leverage ratios applicable to large banking organizations in the U.S. and Europe require such organizations to strengthen their balance sheets and may limit their ability or willingness to make markets on our trading platform. We cannot predict the extent to which these rules or any future regulatory changes may adversely affect our business and operations. 
 Regulation of the Non-U.S. Securities Industries and Investment Service Providers 
 The securities industry and financial markets in the U.K., the European Union (“E.U.”) and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation. Our principal regulator in the U.K. is the FCA. MarketAxess Europe Limited is authorized and regulated by the FCA to operate a Multilateral Trading Facility (“MTF”), and is also authorized as a foreign platform in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore. MarketAxess Capital Limited, which acts as matched principal counterparty for Open Trading transactions on the MTF, is authorized and regulated by the FCA as an investment firm. Xtrakter Limited (“Xtrakter”) is authorized and regulated as a Data Reporting Service Provider with the FCA and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (“AFM”), which allows it to operate as the Trax® ARM and APA.  
 18


The securities industry in the member states of the E.U. is regulated by agencies in each member state.  E.U. measures provide for the mutual recognition of national regulatory agencies and their supervision of investment firms, which makes it possible for the grant of a single authorization to be valid throughout the E.U. Currently, both MarketAxess Europe Limited and Xtrakter provide regulated services to European firms outside of the U.K. in reliance on a cross-border services passport under MiFID.  However, in March 2017, the U.K. notified the European Council of its intention to leave the E.U. (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). By invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the U.K. is currently set to leave the E.U. on March 29, 2019.  Following Brexit, our U.K. subsidiaries will not be able to rely on the existence of a “passporting” regime that allows immediate access to the single E.U. market. Current discussions between the U.K. and the E.U. regarding a withdrawal agreement envisage a temporary continuation of the existing passporting rights during a limited period following March 29, 2019. However, we are not able to predict with any certainty if, or when, the U.K. and the E.U. will sign the withdrawal agreement. Accordingly, we have established new subsidiaries in the E.U. in order to provide our trading platform and certain post-trade services to clients in the E.U. following Brexit. See the Risk Factor captioned “The U.K. exit from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business, clients, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”
 Similar to the U.S., regulatory bodies in Europe have recently implemented new rules for the fixed-income markets. MiFID II and MiFIR were implemented in 2018 and introduced significant changes in market structure designed to: (i) enhance pre- and post-trade transparency for fixed-income instruments with the scope of requirements calibrated for liquidity, (ii) increase and enhance post-trade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit post-trade data to ARMs, (iii) ensure trading of certain derivatives occurs on regulated trading venues and (iv) establish a consolidated tape for trade data. MiFID II has caused us to expend significantly more compliance, business and technology resources, to incur additional operational costs and has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and post-trade businesses. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations will be positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. 
 Our Singapore subsidiary, MarketAxess Singapore Pte. Limited, is authorized to operate as a Recognized Market Operator (“RMO”) and is also a registered platform in Switzerland and Hong Kong. Our Canadian subsidiary, MarketAxess Canada Company, is registered as an Alternative Trading System dealer under the Securities Act of Ontario and is a member of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada. Our Brazilian subsidiary, MarketAxess Plataforma De Negociacao Ltda., is authorized to provide our platform in Brazil under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Central Bank in Brazil.  We also provide our platform in other countries pursuant to exemptions from registration under the laws of such countries. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 454 employees, 272 of whom were based in the U.S. and 182 of whom were based outside of the U.S., principally in the U.K. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
