ITEM 1. BUSINESS
           The following description of our business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above in the Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements or in Section 1A under the heading "Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Introduction
We are an online retailer and advancer of blockchain technology. Through our online retail business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, and housewares, among other products. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the "Website"). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites. Our retail business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Our Retail Business."
Our Medici business initiatives seek to develop and advance the concepts of "Government as a Service" and a "Technology Stack for Civilization" by creating or fostering a set of products and solutions that leverage the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology to generate efficiencies and increase security and control in six areas of civilizational necessity: identity management, property rights and management, central banking and currencies, capital markets, supply chains and commerce, and voting systems. Our Medici business initiatives include our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, Inc. ("Medici Ventures"), which conducts the majority of its business through its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO Group, Inc. ("tZERO"), formerly tØ.com, Inc., a financial technology company pursuing potential financial applications of blockchain technologies as well as non-blockchain businesses. Medici Ventures currently holds minority equity interests in several technology companies whose focuses include the areas mentioned above. Our Medici business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Our Medici Business" and our tZERO business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Our tZERO Business Initiatives."
We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our retail business and additional equity or debt financings. Our Board of Directors continually discusses a variety of potential strategic and financial options and other changes to our business, but has not approved or made any determination to consummate any strategic transaction, and may not do so in the foreseeable future or at all. Our strategic initiatives are described in more detail below under “Strategic Initiatives.” 
Our company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, "Overstock," "Overstock.com,", "O.co," "we," "our" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Our Retail Business
Our retail business generates nearly all of our net revenues. In our retail business, our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize "dream homes" for our target customers—consumers who seek quality, stylish merchandise at bargain prices. At December 31, 2018, we offered 4.9 million products (8.9 million SKUs), of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production), including more than 25,000 private label products offered under eleven private label brands. We believe that the furniture and home goods market, which is highly fragmented and has traditionally been served by brick and mortar stores, will continue transitioning to online sales, particularly as Millennial consumers (which we define as those aged 20-36), who are generally comfortable shopping online, start families and move into new homes. We regularly change our product assortment to meet the evolving preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include, among others, furniture, home décor including rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement, and kitchen items. We compete primarily based on:

• | Quality customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care;


• | Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with a quality shopping experience;

6


• | Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home goods category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience;


• | Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which currently number approximately 4,000; and


• | Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention.

For 2018, nearly all our retail sales through our Website were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders through our network of approximately 4,000 third-party manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers ("partners") selling on our Website. Our use of the term "partner" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our retail partners. We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our supply chain allows us to ship directly to our customers from our suppliers or from our warehouses. Our retail sales also include direct sales of our own inventory shipped from our warehouses. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from direct sales of our own inventory, including some customer returns of partner products. Our warehouses generally ship between 1,500 and 3,000 packages per day and up to approximately 6,000 packages per day during peak periods. 
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 our sales were almost entirely to customers located in the United States and no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue. 
Additional Offerings
We offer additional products or services that may complement our primary retail offerings, but are not significant to our retail revenues. 

• | Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers;


• | Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies;


• | Pet Adoptions, a free service and portal within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States;


• | Overstock Hotels, portal within our Website that enables customers to search and book hundreds of thousands of properties worldwide, including big box brands, modern boutiques, and more;


• | Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and also obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network; and


• | Businesses advertising products or services on our Website.

Manufacturer, Distributor, and Supplier Relationships
To the extent possible we maintain manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships, and seek new manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Generally, our manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers regularly communicate to us the quantity of products that are held in reserve for us, but our arrangements with them generally do not guarantee the availability of those products for a set duration. Our manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships are based on historical experience and are generally non-exclusive and we retain the right to select and change our suppliers at our discretion. Generally, manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers do not control the terms under which products are sold through our Website.
Sales and Marketing
We use a variety of methods to target our retail consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail, and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.
Customer Service
We are committed to providing superior customer service. We staff our customer service department with dedicated in-house and outsourced professionals who respond to phone, instant online chat, and e-mail inquiries on products, ordering, shipping status, returns, and other areas of customer inquiry.
7

Technology
We use our internally developed Website and a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies and solutions to support our retail operations. We use the services of multiple telecommunications companies to obtain connectivity to the Internet. Currently, our primary computer infrastructure is located in a data center in Utah. We also have other data centers which we use for backups, redundancy, development, testing, disaster recovery, and corporate systems infrastructure.
Competition
Internet retail is intensely competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. We believe that competition in this industry is based predominantly on:

• | price;


• | product quality and assortment;


• | shopping convenience;


• | website organization and load speed;


• | order processing and fulfillment;


• | order delivery time;


• | customer service;


• | website functionality on mobile devices;


• | brand recognition; and


• | brand reputation.

We compete with other online retailers, traditional retailers, and liquidation "brokers" which may specifically adopt our methods and target our customers. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies that can be divided into several broad categories:

• | online discount general retailers;


• | online private sale sites;


• | online specialty retailers;


• | online liquidators;


• | online retailers who have or are developing significant "brick and mortar" capabilities; and


• | traditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators, many of which have a significant online presence.

Many of our current and potential e-commerce competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, any of them may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and well-financed companies, including exclusive distribution arrangements with our vendors or service suppliers that could deny us access to key products or needed services, or acquisitions of our suppliers or service providers, having the same effect. Many of them do or could devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to their website and systems development than we do. Many have supply chain operations that decrease product shipping times to their customers, have options for in-store product pick-up, allow in-store returns, or offer other delivery and returns options that we do not have. New technologies, the continued enhancement of existing technologies, developments in related areas such as same-day product deliveries, and the development of proprietary delivery systems increase competitive pressures on us. 
Seasonality
Our retail business is affected by seasonality because of the holiday season, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized 24.8%, 26.2%, and 29.2% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. While we had lower sales volume during Q4 2018, we anticipate the trend of higher sales volume during our fourth quarter to continue for the foreseeable future. 
Financial Information about Business Segments and Geographic Areas
As described further in Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how we manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. Our Retail business is a 
8

reportable segment. As described below, our Medici business is comprised of many components or operating segments, including our tZERO reportable segment. We use pre-tax net income (loss) as the measure to determine our reportable segments. As a result, tZERO is the only reportable segment of our Medici business as it is quantitatively significant. The remaining Medici business operating segments are not significant and are included in Other. See Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 21. Business Segments for information regarding our business segments and geographical areas.
Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets
We regard our domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Included in our intellectual property is some of the financial technology we have developed as part of our Medici initiatives. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets.
Our Medici Business
In late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technologies. We pursue these initiatives through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures and its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO. These initiatives remain in the start-up phase, and neither Medici Ventures nor tZERO has generated significant revenues from any blockchain-based technology or application of blockchain technology. As of December 31, 2018, we have spent approximately $209.6 million in our Medici business since its inception, with the majority of that being spent in tZERO.
Medici Ventures
Medici Ventures' strategy is to develop and advance the concepts of "Government as a Service" and a "Technology Stack for Civilization" by creating or fostering a set of products and solutions that leverage blockchain technology to generate efficiencies and increase security and control in six areas of civilizational necessity: identity management, property rights and management, central banking and currencies, capital markets, supply chains and commerce, and voting systems. A blockchain is a cryptographically secured, distributed infrastructure, or network, which may be accessed and, in some cases, maintained by each member of the network. Medici Ventures has a team of approximately 37 software engineers, developers and other technologists who work in blockchain development and deployment and enterprise level software development and deployment. Medici Ventures provides the services of its software engineers, developers, or other technologists to other blockchain companies. Medici Ventures also owns strategic minority equity interests in several blockchain-related companies, each of which focuses on at least one of the Government as a Service areas mentioned above. Medici Ventures takes an active interest in and holds seats on the boards of some of these companies. These companies include technology companies whose focuses include commercial blockchain applications for identity and social media, property and land, money and banking, capital markets, supply chain, and voting. All of the companies in which Medici Ventures holds strategic equity interests are startup businesses, businesses in the development stage, or businesses with a short operating history. The majority of Medici Ventures' business is its 80% interest in tZERO, which, as described below, is a financial technology company pursuing potential financial applications for blockchain technologies.
See "Risk Factors-Additional Risks Relating to Our Medici Business."
tZERO
Medici Ventures' majority-owned subsidiary tZERO is a financial technology company pursuing potential financial applications of blockchain technologies as well as non-blockchain businesses. tZERO has a team of approximately 50 software engineers, developers and other technologists who focus on developing and exploring opportunities for novel applications of blockchain technology. As a result of its early stage of development, tZERO has not yet generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based applications. tZERO is currently involved in, among other things, the following:

• | Blockchain Services - Token Trading Systems. In connection with Overstock's 2016 SEC-registered offering of Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred"), tZERO developed a suite of software and technologies referred to as the tZERO Issuance and Trading Platform (the "tZERO Platform"). The Series A Shares trade exclusively on the PRO Securities ATS, which utilizes the tZERO Platform. tZERO has been leveraging its experience and expertise from developing the tZERO Platform for the Series A Preferred to develop trading systems that are capable of trading tZERO's Preferred Equity Tokens ("tZERO Security Tokens"), issued in a private placement completed in October 2018, and, ultimately, other issuer's digital securities (such systems, the "Token Trading Systems"). First, in January 2019, the PRO Securities ATS, utilizing the tZERO Platform, partnering with Dinosaur Financial Group, LLC ("Dino") and Electronic Transaction Clearing, Inc. ("ETC"), each

9

SEC-registered broker-dealers and FINRA members, began facilitating private placement resales of tZERO Security Tokens to accredited investors in reliance upon an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(7) of the Securities Act.  Second, in June 2018, tZERO and BOX Digital Markets LLC ("BOX Digital") announced that they had entered into a joint venture, named Boston Security Token Exchange LLC, intended to develop a U.S. national securities exchange (the "Exchange") with regulatory approvals that would enable the Exchange to trade digital securities. The Exchange will require approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prior to beginning operations. tZERO is creating the necessary technology, and will manage the ongoing technology implementation, administration, maintenance and support. BOX Digital is providing executive leadership and regulatory expertise. Subject to obtaining SEC approval, tZERO and Box Digital intend for the Exchange to operate as a facility of BOX Options Exchange, an existing registered U.S. securities exchange. We have been informed that the management of the joint venture continues to work with the Staff of the SEC, and anticipates filing the proposed trading rules of the Exchange in the second quarter of 2019. The commencement of operations of the Exchange would be subject to approval by the SEC of the trading rules and other matters. tZERO continues to explore the viability of other Token Trading Systems, any of which may be developed as an additional functionality of the PRO Securities ATS, as a functionality of another U.S. alternative trading system, as a functionality of a non-U.S. trading system or a non-U.S. exchange that tZERO may operate or designate, or any other format, wherever situated.

• | tZERO Preferred Equity Tokens. tZERO issued the tZERO Security Tokens on October 12, 2018, and in January 2019, tZERO began secondary trading of tZERO security tokens by accredited investors using digital securities brokerage accounts at Dino, which is serving as the introducing broker-dealer in connection with the PRO Securities ATS.


• | Blockchain Services - Digital Locate Receipts ("DLR") software. The "digital locate receipt" software (the "DLR Software") is currently in customer production testing, which is being conducted by a third party, and tZERO has not yet entered into any commercial licenses with any licensees. The DLR Software is intended to help broker-dealer licensees with stock inventory to both load and manage their inventory in order to assist short sellers of public securities in establishing that they have located available shares in the U.S. public securities market prior to effecting short sales. The DLR Software is intended to enable licensees to create a blockchain-based record of the shares that the licensee has made available for "locates" using customizable DLR Software functionality and of the daily purchases of the right to "locate" specifically identified shares for purposes of compliance with regulatory requirements. The broker-dealer licensees of DLR Software are the parties responsible for ensuring that locates issued using the DLR Software comply with all applicable regulations, and the commercial viability of the DLR Software is dependent on the ability of broker-dealer licensees to establish locates using the DLR Software as an effective means of satisfying regulatory obligations in connection with effecting short sales.


• | Blockchain Services - Bitsy, Inc. Effective January 1, 2019, tZERO acquired 100% of the equity interest in Bitsy, Inc. by purchasing the 67% equity interest in Bitsy held by Steve Hopkins, Medici Ventures' former chief operating officer and general counsel, and current president of tZERO, and affiliates for $8.0 million in cash, and purchasing the remaining 33% of the Bitsy common stock from Medici Ventures for a $4.0 million convertible promissory note due December 31, 2020 and an assignment of certain intellectual property to Medici Ventures. In September 2018, Bitsy announced that it had begun a limited beta launch of a digital wallet service intended to create a bridge between traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.


• | Non-blockchain services - SpeedRoute and PRO Securities. tZERO wholly owns two registered broker-dealers, SpeedRoute, LLC ("SpeedRoute") and PRO Securities, LLC ("PRO Securities"). SpeedRoute is an electronic, agency‑only Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA")-registered broker-dealer that provides connectivity for its customers to U.S. equity exchanges as well as off-exchange sources of liquidity such as dark pools. All of SpeedRoute's customers are registered broker-dealers. SpeedRoute does not hold, own or sell securities. PRO Securities is a FINRA-registered broker-dealer that owns and operates the PRO Securities alternative trading system (the "PRO Securities ATS"), which has filed a Form ATS with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") notifying the SEC of its activities as an alternative trading system, or ATS. The PRO Securities ATS is a closed system available only to its broker dealer subscribers. PRO Securities does not accept orders from non-broker dealers, nor does it hold, own or sell securities.


• | Non-blockchain services - Verify Investor, LLC. tZERO purchased 81.0% of Verify Investor, LLC, an accredited investor verification company, for $12 million in cash, in February 2018. Verify Investor, LLC, through its website VerifyInvestor.com, provides a fast, easy, and cost-effective method of compliance for companies seeking to verify their investors as accredited investors.

tZERO is no longer offering automated investment advisory services through tZERO Advisors or electronic discount trading through Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. (Member: FINRA & SIPC) under the FinanceHub tab on our Website. On January 18, 2019, tZERO sold its entire equity interest in StockCross Financial Services, Inc. to StockCross Financial Services, Inc. and Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. for an amount equal to our original purchase price. 
In January 2019, tZERO obtained a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a system that can take orders to trade “digital transactional items” such as securities, tokens, shares, cash, and other assets from broker dealers and then translate the orders into crypto orders on a digital trading platform or exchange. The patent was recently awarded and to date has not had any effects on tZERO’s business. tZERO believes that the patent will assist in protecting tZERO's proprietary technologies as competitors begin to develop their own trading platforms. 
In March 2019, we disclosed that we had executed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding a potential equity investment of up to $100 million in tZERO to be co-led by GSR Capital and Makara Capital, subject to due diligence, negotiation of binding contracts and regulatory approval. We are in continuing discussions regarding the potential investment, but have not yet entered into any definitive agreement.
We believe that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop trading systems utilizing distributed ledger or blockchain technologies or other novel technologies that may be competitive with tZERO's technology, including its patented technology. Although it is difficult to obtain reliable information about blockchain activities by companies that may be our competitors, they may include companies such as SharesPost, OpenFinance Network, Templum Inc., Coinbase, KoreConX, Blocktrade AG, Smart Valor, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Intercontinental Exchange, Circle, Ideanomics, CrowdEngine, Securitize, Harbor, Polymath, and other entities that are operating trading venues offshore or otherwise structured in an effort to avoid aspects of U.S. regulation.
To the extent that tZERO attempts to market its DLR Software, tZERO would be competing with virtually all of the largest broker dealers in the U.S., all of which have substantially greater resources than tZERO or Overstock, and some of which may generate substantial revenues and profits from the existing firmly entrenched system.
SpeedRoute and Pro Securities compete with a large number of broker dealers, many of which are substantially larger and have substantially greater financial resources than SpeedRoute, Pro Securities, tZERO or Overstock.
See "Risk Factors-Additional Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives."
Strategic Initiatives
We have engaged Guggenheim Securities, LLC to help us identify and evaluate certain strategic initiatives. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our retail business and additional equity or debt financings. Our Board of Directors continually discusses a variety of potential strategic and financial options and other changes to our business, but has not approved or made any determination to consummate any strategic transaction, and may choose not to do so in the foreseeable future or at all.
If we sell our retail business, the sale may not require approval by our stockholders under Delaware law. If we enter into an agreement to sell our retail business and determine that no vote of our stockholders is required, we do not expect to submit it to a vote. If we sell our retail business, we currently expect to retain all or substantially all of the after-tax proceeds of the sale for use in our blockchain initiatives.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
From time to time, we receive claims and become subject to regulatory investigations or other governmental actions, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business. We also prosecute lawsuits to enforce our legal rights. Regulatory investigations and other governmental actions as well as any litigation may be costly and time consuming and can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Regulatory investigations and other governmental actions as well as any such litigation may result in significant damages, associated costs, or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business. Any such matters may materially harm our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
These matters and other types of claims could result in legal expenses, fines, adverse judgments or settlements and increase the cost of doing business. They could also require us to change our business practices in expensive and significant 
11

ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that may limit our current or future business, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise increase our costs.
Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.
For further information, see (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors") and the information set forth under Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies, Legal proceedings and contingencies, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations, some of which apply or may apply to us as a result of our retail business, some of which apply or may apply to us as a result of our Medici business, and others of which apply to us for other reasons, such as our status as a publicly held company or the places in which we sell certain types or amounts of products. Our retail business is subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, and other services we offer. Existing and future laws and regulations may result in increasing expense and may impede our growth. Applicable and potentially applicable regulations and laws include regulations and laws regarding taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, import and export matters, information reporting requirements, access to our services and facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics and quality of products and services, product labeling and unfair and deceptive trade practices.
Our efforts to expand our retail business outside of the U.S. expose us to foreign and additional U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, advertising practices, online services, the use of cryptocurrency, the importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties.
Our Medici and tZERO businesses are subject to general business regulations and laws, including some of those described above, but are also affected by a number of other laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to money transmitters and money services businesses, including the requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("FinCEN"), cryptocurrencies, public benefit corporations, provisions of various securities laws and other laws and regulations governing broker dealers, alternative trading systems and national securities exchanges, anti-money laundering requirements, know-your-customer requirements, record-keeping, reporting and capital and bonding requirements, and a variety of other matters. Blockchain and distributed ledger platforms are recent technological innovations, and the regulation of securities tokens and other digital assets is developing. In the U.S., the businesses that we are working to develop are or may be subject to a wide variety of complex statutes and rules, most of which were implemented prior to the development of these technologies, and it is sometimes unclear whether or how various statutes or regulations apply. 
The Token Trading System launched in January 2019 is subject to or affected by numerous laws and regulations. The Token Trading System relies on the PRO Securities ATS, which is subject to Regulation ATS as well as other regulations, and which utilizes the tZERO Platform, partnering with broker-dealers that are also subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA, in order to facilitate private placement resales of tZERO Security Tokens to accredited investors in reliance upon an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(7) of the Securities Act. The joint venture that tZERO and BOX Digital announced in June 2018 is seeking regulatory approvals that would enable the parties to operate a national securities exchange to trade security tokens. A national securities exchange, which will require approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prior to beginning operations, will be subject to provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and regulation substantially greater than that applicable to tZERO's current operations. In addition, depending on the digital assets traded, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission may consider the assets to be commodities or derivatives and subject to additional regulation. Certain aspects of our Medici business, including Bitsy's operations which were subsequently acquired by tZERO, are or may be subject to the state and federal laws and regulations applicable to money service businesses, including the requirements of FinCEN.

See Item 1A—"Risk Factors—Additional Risks Relating to Our Medici Business" and "Additional Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives." 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,060 full-time employees. We seasonally increase our workforce during our fourth quarter to handle increased workload in both our warehouse and customer service operations. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relationships to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff.
