ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. We were formed in 1974 as a bank holding company and are headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With our subsidiaries, we have been in business since 1864. We completed a redomestication from the State of Florida to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on August 30, 2016. The redomestication was effected pursuant to a plan of conversion approved by our Board of Directors and stockholders. As a result of the redomestication, we are organized under and subject to Pennsylvania law, and remain the same entity that existed before the redomestication, with the same legal existence without interruption, and are deemed to have commenced our existence as of the time we were incorporated under Florida law in 2001. We were originally incorporated in 1974 in Pennsylvania and reincorporated in Florida in 2001 after experiencing substantial growth of our business and operations in Florida in prior years. In 2004, we spun-off our Florida operations in a newly formed public company and refocused on growing our markets in Pennsylvania. Since that time, the majority of our assets, operations and employees have been located in Pennsylvania. 
The redomestication did not cause any change in the business, physical location, management, assets, debts or liabilities of FNB. All individuals who served as directors, officers and employees of FNB prior to the redomestication continued to serve in those capacities after the redomestication. Except for the change in the state law governing our legal existence, the redomestication did not affect our common stock or Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E shares or the trading of those securities on the NYSE under the symbols “FNB” and “FNBPrE,” respectively.
As a diversified financial services holding company, FNB, through our subsidiaries, provides a full range of financial services, principally to consumers, corporations, governments and small- to medium-sized businesses in our market areas through our subsidiary network, which is led by our largest subsidiary, FNBPA. Our business strategy focuses primarily on providing quality, consumer- and commercial-based financial services adapted to the needs of each of the markets we serve. We seek to maintain our community orientation by providing local management with certain autonomy in decision making, enabling them to respond to customer requests more quickly and to concentrate on transactions within their market areas. We seek to preserve some decision making at a local level, however, we have centralized legal, loan review, credit underwriting, accounting, investment, audit, loan operations, deposit operations and data processing functions. The centralization of these processes enables us to maintain consistent quality of these functions and to achieve certain economies of scale.
As of December 31, 2018, we have three reportable business segments: Community Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance. As of December 31, 2018, we have 396 Community Banking offices in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $33.1 billion, loans of $22.2 billion and deposits of $23.5 billion. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Report.

Significant Business Combinations
We seek to grow through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. A summary of the acquisitions, exclusive of branch and insurance acquisitions, completed during the past five years is summarized below:

Acquired Entity | Acquired Bank | Year | Fair Value ofAssets Acquired
(dollars in millions) | | | 
Yadkin Financial Corporation | Yadkin Bank | 2017 | $ | 6,780
Metro Bancorp, Inc. | Metro Bank | 2016 | 2,784 | 
OBA Financial Services, Inc. | OBA Bank | 2014 | 390 | 
BCSB Bancorp, Inc. | Baltimore County Savings Bank | 2014 | 596 | 

For more detailed information concerning acquisitions, see Note 3, “Mergers and Acquisitions” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report.
Recent Developments
Regency Finance Corporation        
On August 31, 2018, we completed the sale of 100 percent of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Regency to Mariner Finance, LLC in exchange for cash consideration of $142 million. This transaction was completed to accomplish several strategic objectives, including enhancing the credit risk profile of the consumer loan portfolio, offering additional liquidity and selling a non-strategic business segment that no longer fits with our core business.  The transaction included a reduction of $131.9 million in direct installment consumer loans, a net charge-off of $7.1 million for the mark to fair value on the Regency loans prior to sale with no associated provision impact, a write-off of $1.8 million of goodwill, and a reduction of branch/retail properties leased by FNB.  As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain on sale of $5.1 million during the third quarter.
Business Segments
In addition to the following information relating to our business segments, more detailed information is contained in Note 23, “Business Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report. As of December 31, 2018, FNB had three business segments, with the largest being the Community Banking segment consisting of a regional community bank. The Wealth Management segment consists of a trust company, a registered investment advisor and a subsidiary that offers broker-dealer services through a third-party networking arrangement with a non-affiliated licensed broker-dealer entity. The Insurance segment consists of an insurance agency and a reinsurer. 
Community Banking
Our Community Banking segment consists of FNBPA, which offers commercial and consumer banking services. Commercial banking solutions include corporate banking, small business banking, investment real estate financing, business credit, capital markets and lease financing. Consumer banking products and services include deposit products, mortgage lending, consumer lending and a complete suite of mobile and online banking services. Additionally, Bank Capital Services, LLC, a subsidiary of FNBPA, offers commercial loans and leases to customers in need of new or used equipment. As of December 31, 2018, our Community Banking segment operated in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our branch network spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. 
The goals of Community Banking are to generate high-quality, profitable revenue growth through increased business with our current customers, attract new customer relationships through FNBPA’s current branches and expand into new and existing markets through de novo branch openings and the establishment of loan production offices. We consider Community Banking an important source of revenue opportunity through the cross-selling of products and services offered by our other business segments.
The lending philosophy of Community Banking is to establish high-quality customer relationships, while minimizing credit losses by following strict credit approval standards (which include independent analysis of realizable collateral value), diversifying our loan portfolio by industry, product and borrower, and conducting ongoing review and management of the loan 
4


portfolio. Commercial loans are generally made to established businesses within the geographic market areas served by Community Banking.
No material portion of the loans or deposits of Community Banking has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer’s loans or deposits or a small group of customers’ loans or deposits by Community Banking would not have a material adverse effect on the Community Banking segment or on FNB. The substantial majority of the loans and deposits have been generated within the geographic market areas in which Community Banking operates.
Wealth Management
Our Wealth Management segment delivers wealth management services to individuals, corporations and retirement funds, as well as existing customers of Community Banking, located primarily within our geographic markets.
Our Wealth Management operations are conducted through three subsidiaries of FNBPA. FNTC provides a broad range of personal and corporate fiduciary services, including the administration of decedent and trust estates. As of December 31, 2018, the fair value of trust assets under management was approximately $5.1 billion. FNTC is required to maintain certain minimum capitalization levels in accordance with regulatory requirements. FNTC periodically measures its capital position to ensure all minimum capitalization levels are maintained.
Our Wealth Management segment also includes two other subsidiaries. First National Investment Services Company, LLC offers a broad array of investment products and services for customers of Wealth Management through a networking relationship with a third-party licensed brokerage firm. FNBIA, an investment advisor registered with the SEC, offers customers of Wealth Management comprehensive investment programs featuring mutual funds, annuities, stocks and bonds.
No material portion of the business of Wealth Management has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer’s business or the business of a small group of customers by Wealth Management would not have a material adverse effect on the Wealth Management segment or on FNB.
Insurance
Our Insurance segment operates principally through FNIA, which is a subsidiary of FNB. FNIA is a full-service insurance brokerage agency offering numerous lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers to businesses and individuals primarily within FNB’s geographic markets. The goal of FNIA is to grow revenue through cross-selling to existing clients of Community Banking and to gain new clients through its own channels.
Our Insurance segment also includes a reinsurance subsidiary, Penn-Ohio. Penn-Ohio underwrites, as a reinsurer, credit life and accident and health insurance sold by FNB’s lending subsidiaries. Additionally, FNBPA owns a direct subsidiary, First National Corporation, which offers title insurance products.
No material portion of the business of Insurance has been obtained from a single customer or small group of customers, and the loss of any one customer’s business or the business of a small group of customers by Insurance would not have a material adverse effect on the Insurance segment or on FNB.
Other
We also operate other non-banking subsidiaries which are not to be considered reportable segments of FNB. F.N.B. Capital Corporation, LLC (FNBCC) was formed as a merchant banking subsidiary to offer mezzanine financing options for small- to medium-sized businesses that need financial assistance beyond the parameters of typical commercial bank lending products. FNBCC ceased financing new portfolio companies in July 2013. FNBCC has a 21.5% funding commitment in Tecum Capital Partners, L.P. (formerly known as F.N.B. Capital Partners, L.P.) (Tecum), a Small Business Investment Company licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration. Tecum is not an affiliate or a subsidiary of FNB. We have six companies that issued TPS to third-party investors: F.N.B. Statutory Trust II, Omega Financial Capital Trust I, Yadkin Valley Statutory Trust I, FNB Financial Services Capital Trust I, American Community Capital Trust II and Crescent Financial Capital Trust I, the last four of which were acquired in conjunction with the YDKN acquisition. FNB Financial Services, Inc. and FNB Consumer Financial Services, Inc. are subsidiaries of FNB and are the general partner and limited partner, respectively, of FNB Financial Services, LP, the company established to issue, administer and repay the subordinated notes. The proceeds received from the subordinated notes issuances are a general funding source for FNB. Certain financial information concerning these subsidiaries, along with the parent company and intercompany eliminations, are included in the “Parent and Other” category in Note 23, “Business Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this Report.

Market Area and Competition
We operate in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our market coverage spans several major metropolitan areas including: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio; and Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and the Piedmont Triad (Winston-Salem, Greensboro and High Point) in North Carolina. 
We compete for loans, deposits and financial services business with a large number of bank and non-bank financial institutions and other lenders engaged in the business of extending credit, including financial technology companies and marketplace lenders. Competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies and other financial services companies. The most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. Additional competition for deposits comes from non-depositary competitors such as financial technology companies, mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. In providing wealth and asset management services, as well as insurance brokerage services, our subsidiaries compete with many other financial services firms, brokerage firms, mutual fund complexes, investment management firms, trust and fiduciary service providers and insurance agencies. Competition for loans and deposits often is based on the rates of interest charged, the rates of interest paid to obtain funds and the availability of customer services.
The ability to deploy and use technology effectively is an important competitive factor in the financial services industry. Technology is not only important with respect to the delivery of financial services, risk management, regulatory compliance and security of customer information, but also in processing information. FNB and each of our subsidiaries must continually make technological investments to remain competitive in the financial services industry. FNBPA has executed several initiatives that have integrated and streamlined its physical branch and e-delivery channels.
Underwriting
Commercial Loans
Our commercial loan policy requires, among other things, that all commercial loans be underwritten to document the borrower’s financial capacity to support the cash flow required to repay the loan. The commercial loan policy also contains additional guidelines and requirements applicable to specific loan products or lines of business. We have developed a proprietary underwriting system for all corporate business loan relationships and utilize a third-party solution for small business loan relationships, with both platforms supporting consistency in underwriting across the entire footprint and credit decisions to be made at the local and regional level in accordance with approval policies. As part of this underwriting, we require clear and concise documentation of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan based on current financial statements and/or tax returns, plus pro-forma financial statements, as appropriate. Specific guidelines for loan terms and conditions are outlined in our Credit Policy. The guidelines also detail the collateral requirements for various loan types. It is our general practice to obtain personal guarantees, supported by current personal financial statements and/or tax returns, to reduce the credit risk, as appropriate.
For loans secured by commercial real estate, we obtain current and independent appraisals from licensed or certified appraisers to assess the value of the underlying collateral. Our general policy for commercial real estate loans is to limit the terms of the loans to not more than 20 years and to have loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 80% on owner-occupied and income producing properties, while land and development-secured projects have more stringent LTV requirements of 65% and 75%, respectively. For non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, the loan terms are generally aligned with the property’s lease terms, and in many instances, these loans mature within 5 years. As it relates to non-real estate secured loans, our Credit Policy dictates similar guidelines for maximum terms and acceptable advance rates for loans that are not secured by real estate.
Consumer Loans
Our revolving home equity lines of credit are variable rate loans underwritten based on fully indexed rates. For home equity loans, our policy is to generally require an LTV ratio not in excess of 85% and FICO scores of not less than 660. In certain circumstances, we will extend credit to borrowers with an LTV ratio over 85% on a limited and closely monitored basis. Our underwriters evaluate a borrower’s debt service capacity on all line of credit applications by utilizing an interest shock rate of 3% over the prevailing variable interest rate at origination. The borrower’s debt-to-income ratio must remain within our guidelines under the shock rate repayment formula. FNB tightly limits the origination of non-QM loans (see discussion under the caption “Consumer Protection Statutes and Regulations”).
FNB’s policy for our indirect installment loans, which third parties (primarily auto dealers) within our approved dealer network originate, is to require a minimum FICO score of 640 for the borrower, the age of the vehicle not to exceed 8 years or 100,000 
6


miles and an appropriate LTV ratio, not to exceed 115% inclusive of back-end added products, based on the year and make of the vehicle financed.
We structure our consumer loan products to meet the diverse credit needs of consumers in our market for personal and household purposes. These loan products are on a fixed amount or revolving basis depending on customer need and borrowing capacity. Our loans and lines of credit attempt to balance borrower budgeting sensitivities with realistic repayment maturities within a philosophy that encourages consumer financial responsibility, sound credit risk management and development of strong customer relationships.
Our consumer loan policies and procedures require prospective borrowers to provide appropriate and accurate financial information that will enable our loan underwriting personnel to make sound credit decisions. Specific information requirements vary based on loan type, risk profile and secondary investor requirements where applicable. FNB typically requires that we obtain evidence of capacity to repay as well as an independent credit report, both of which help assess the prospective borrower’s willingness and ability to repay the debt. If any information submitted by the prospective borrower raises reasonable doubts with respect to the willingness and ability of the borrower to repay the loan, FNB denies the credit. 
We often take collateral to support an extension of credit and to provide additional protection should the primary source of repayment fail. Consequently, we limit unsecured extensions of credit in amount and only grant them to borrowers with adequate capacity and above-average credit profiles. We expressly discourage unsecured credit lines for debt consolidation, unless there is compelling evidence that the borrower has sufficient liquidity and net worth to repay the loan from alternative sources in the event of income disruption.
Our loan policy requires full independent appraisals of residential real estate collateral values on residential mortgage applications of $250,000 and greater. We may use algorithm-based valuation models for residential mortgages under $250,000. We recognize the limitations as well as the benefits of these valuation products. FNB’s policy is to be conservative in their use but fluid and flexible in interpreting reasonable collateral values when obtained.
We monitor consumer loans with exceptions to our policy including, but not limited to, LTV ratios, FICO scores and debt-to-income ratios. Management routinely evaluates the type, nature, trend and scope of these exceptions and reacts through policy changes, lender counseling, adjustment of loan authorities and similar prerogatives to assure that the retail assets generated meet acceptable credit quality standards. As an added precaution, our risk management personnel conduct periodic reviews of loan files.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, FNB and our subsidiaries had 3,880 full-time and 540 part-time employees. Our management considers our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
Government Supervision and Regulation
The following summary sets forth certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to FNB, FNBPA and our subsidiaries and affiliates. The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulatory oversight and, in particular, bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates (depending upon charter and business activities) are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, SEC, FINRA and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs FNB and its affiliates is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the federal insurance fund, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole; however, this framework is not specifically for the protection of security holders. Significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to FNB and our affiliates are described in this section. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions or governmental policies, such descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies referenced herein. In addition, certain of FNB’s public disclosure, internal control environment, risk and capital management and corporate governance principles are subject to SOX, the Dodd-Frank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth Act, and related regulations and rules of the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Also, FNB is subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. 
Political, economic, industry events and other factors typically result in the banking laws, regulations and policies to be continually subject to review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance, which sometimes materially changes regulatory expectations. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory 
7


policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation, expectations or implementation, could have a material effect on our business or organization.
Both the scope of the laws and regulations, as well as expectations regarding risk management, and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also significantly increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place.
On May 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed into law the Economic Growth Act, which repealed or modified several important provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Economic Growth Act raises the total asset thresholds to $250 billion for Dodd-Frank Act annual company-run stress testing, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, and resolution planning requirements for bank holding companies, subject to the ability of the FRB to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of $100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns. On July 6, 2018, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the Economic Growth Act. As a result of this statement and the Economic Growth Act, FNB and FNBPA are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements, however we will continue to perform capital stress testing consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of our banking regulators. On December 18, 2018, the OCC published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the OCC’s stress testing rule and revise the stress testing asset threshold.
The Economic Growth Act also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas, for which the banking agencies issued certain corresponding proposed and interim final rules, including:

• | Prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on HVCRE exposures unless they are for ADC loans, and clarifying ADC status;


• | Requiring the federal banking agencies to amend the LCR Rule such that all qualifying investment-grade, liquid and readily-marketable municipal securities are treated as level 2B liquid assets, making them more attractive investment alternatives;


• | Exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than $400,000; and


• | Directing the CFPB to provide guidance on the applicability of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans, as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes. (See discussion under Risk Factors - caption “We could be adversely affected by changes in the law, especially changes in the regulation of the banking industry”).

GENERAL
FNB is a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. As a financial holding company and a bank holding company, FNB is regulated under the BHC, as amended, and is subject to regulation, inspection, examination and supervision by the FRB.
Under the BHC Act, FRB is the “umbrella” regulator of a financial holding company. In addition, a financial holding company’s operating entities, meaning its subsidiary broker-dealers, investment managers, investment advisory companies, insurance companies and banks, as applicable, are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal and state “functional” regulators and self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA.
Our subsidiary bank, FNBPA, and FNBPA’s subsidiary trust company, FNTC, are organized as national banking associations, which are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is a bureau of the UST. FNBPA is also subject to certain regulatory requirements of the CFPB, the FDIC, the FRB and other federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, capital requirements, limitations regarding dividends, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged on loans, affiliate transactions, CRA, consumer compliance and anti-discrimination laws and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices prohibitions, monitoring obligations under the federal bank secrecy act and anti-money laundering requirements, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, cyber security and consumer privacy requirements, activities that may be engaged in and types of services that may be offered. In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, FNB and our subsidiaries are subject to various other laws and regulations and supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of FNB and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil monetary 
8


penalties, imposition of cease and desist orders or other written directives, removal of management and, in certain cases, criminal penalties.
Pursuant to the GLB Act, bank holding companies such as FNB that have qualified as financial holding companies because they are “well-capitalized” and “well managed” have broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, including insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making; and such additional activities as the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the UST determines to be financial in nature, incidental thereto or complementary to a financial activity. As a result of the GLB Act, a bank holding company may engage in those activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a “financial holding company.” As a financial holding company, FNB may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature, either de novo or by acquisition, provided the FNB continues such status and gives the FRB after-the-fact notice of the new activities. The GLB Act also permits national banks, such as FNBPA, to engage in activities considered financial in nature through a financial subsidiary, subject to certain conditions and limitations and with the approval of the OCC (see discussion under the caption, “Financial Holding Company Status and Activities”).
As a regulated financial holding company, FNB’s relationships and good standing with our regulators are of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses. The FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFPB and SEC have broad enforcement powers and authority to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices of FNB or our subsidiaries to open new or close existing offices, conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets or reconfigure existing operations. In addition, FNB, FNBPA, FNTC and other affiliates are subject to examination by the various federal and state regulators, which involves periodic examinations and supervisory inquiries, the reports of which are not publicly available and can affect ratings that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses. These examinations consider not only safety and soundness principles, but also compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering requirements, loan quality and administration, capital levels, asset quality and risk management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, consumer compliance, anti-discrimination laws, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices prohibitions, community reinvestment, cyber security and consumer privacy requirements, and various other factors. The federal banking interagency Guidelines for Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness set forth compliance considerations and guidance with respect to the following operations of banking organizations: (1) internal controls and information systems; (2) internal audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate exposure; (6) asset growth; (7) executive compensation, fees and benefits; (8) asset quality; and (9) earnings. Significant adverse findings reporting safety and soundness or violations of laws or regulations by any of FNB’s federal bank regulators could potentially result in the imposition of significant fines, penalties, reimbursements, enforcement actions as well as limitations and prohibitions on the activities and growth of FNB and our subsidiaries.
There are numerous laws, regulations and rules governing the activities of financial institutions - including non-bank financial institutions, such as financial technology companies and marketplace lenders, which provide products and services comparable to banking organizations - financial holding companies and bank holding companies. The following discussion is general in nature and seeks to highlight some of the more significant of these regulatory requirements, but does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations that apply to us and our subsidiaries.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
The Dodd-Frank Act continues to have a broad impact on the financial services industry by imposing significant regulatory and compliance requirements including, among other things:

• | enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies;


• | increased capital and liquidity requirements;


• | increased regulatory examination fees;


• | increased assessments banks must pay the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and


• | specific provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of bank safety and soundness and consumer practices, by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities.

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system that is enforced by new and existing federal regulatory agencies and authorities, including the FSOC, FRB, OCC, FDIC and CFPB. The following description briefly summarizes certain impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on the operations and activities, both currently and prospectively, of FNB, FNBPA, and our subsidiaries and affiliates.
Deposit Insurance.  The Dodd-Frank Act established a $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit 
9


insurance premiums paid to the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund are calculated. Under the amendments, the FDIC assessment base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a phase-in of the minimum designated reserve ratio for the DIF, increasing it from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits which was achieved as of the third quarter of 2018. FDIC regulations provide that, among other things, upon reaching the minimum, surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more will cease. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the requirement of the FDIC to pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has set the target designated reserve ratio at 2%. Through September 30, 2018, the FDIC collected a 4.5 basis point annualized premium surcharge assessed on assets over $10 billion of each institution assessment base. In 2018, the premium surcharge resulted in an additional expense of $6.6 million. Assessment rates are scheduled to decrease when the reserve ratio exceeds 2%.
In addition, TCJA, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, disallows the deduction of FDIC deposit insurance premium payments for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. For banks with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as FNBPA, the premium deduction is phased-out based on the proportion of the bank’s assets exceeding $10 billion. 
Interest on Demand Deposits.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, depository institutions are permitted to pay interest on demand deposits. In accordance therewith, we pay interest on certain classes of commercial demand deposits.
Volcker Rule. Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (known as the Volcker Rule) prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading, except under limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent (3%) of Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds. In December 2013, the federal banking agencies adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule (the Volcker Implementing Rules). The Volcker Implementing Rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds, which are referred to as “covered funds.” The Volcker Implementing Rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions and require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to the entity’s regulators. Although the Volcker Implementing Rules provide for some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on the size of an institution, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking organizations of any size. The Volcker Implementing Rules became effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period was extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2015. In addition, the FRB granted extensions until July 21, 2017 of the conformance period for banking entities to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013, and in December 2016 provided guidance allowing for additional extensions to the conformance period for certain illiquid funds. We have evaluated the requirements of the Volcker Implementing Rules with respect to our investments and we do not expect any material divestitures of such investments or other financial implications.
In addition, in August 2017 the OCC published a notice and request for comment on whether certain aspects of the Volcker Rule should be revised to better accomplish the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act while decreasing the compliance burden on banking organizations and fostering economic growth. The request for comment invited input on ways in which to tailor the Volcker Rule’s requirements and clarify key provisions that define prohibited and permissible activities, as well as input on how the federal regulatory agencies could implement the existing Rule more effectively without revising the Volcker Implementing Rules. Specifically, the OCC requested comments on the scope of entities subject to the Volcker Rule, the proprietary trading prohibition, the covered funds prohibition, and the compliance program and metrics reporting requirements. On July 17, 2018, the OCC, FRB, FDIC, SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission published a joint notice of proposed rulemaking designed to simplify and tailor compliance requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. The proposed changes are intended to streamline the rule by eliminating or modifying requirements that are not necessary to effectively implement the statute, while maintaining the core principles of the Volcker Rule, as well as the safety and soundness of banking entities. Specifically, the proposal requested comment on narrowing the definition of what is a covered fund that a bank cannot sponsor or invest in, and broadening the “Super 23A” exemptions to match those in the FRB’s Regulation W. We cannot assure you as to whether and to what extent the proposed regulations that would simplify compliance with the Volcker Rule will be adopted. If adopted, the regulations may affect us in the future by reducing some of our compliance costs, and expanding opportunities, but we may experience some transition costs in developing and implementing changes in conformance with the rules once finalized. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The CFPB’s responsibility is to establish, implement and enforce laws, rules and regulations under certain federal consumer financial laws, as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act and interpreted by the CFPB, with respect to the conduct of both bank and non-bank providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking and enforcement authority over many of the statutes that govern products and services banks offer to consumers. 
10


The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products and services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general will have the authority to enforce consumer protection rules that the CFPB adopts against state-chartered institutions and against, with respect to certain non-preempted laws, national banks. Compliance with any such new regulation or other precedent established by the CFPB and/or states could reduce our revenue, increase our cost of operations and compliance, and limit, prevent, or make more costly, our ability to expand into certain products and services. Over the past several years, the CFPB has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and nonbank financial institutions to enforce federal consumer financial laws. Other federal financial regulatory agencies, including the OCC, as well as state attorneys general and state banking agencies and other state financial regulators also have been increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction. We have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements. 
Debit Card Interchange Fees.  The FRB, pursuant to its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act, has issued rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion, adopting a per-transaction interchange cap base of $0.21 plus 0.05% of the transaction total (and an additional one cent to account for fraud protection costs).
Transactions with Affiliates.  Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by Regulation W, banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between banks and their non-bank affiliates. In general, banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving non-bank affiliates. Also, transactions between banks and their non-bank affiliates are required to be on arms-length terms and consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” to include the borrowing or lending of securities or derivative transactions, and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. In addition, the provisions of the Volcker Rule apply similar restrictions on transactions between a bank and any “covered fund” that the bank advises or sponsors.
Transactions with Insiders.  The Dodd-Frank Act expands insider transaction limitations through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and extending the types of transactions subject to the various requirements to include derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also places restrictions on certain asset sales to and from an insider of an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, receive the approval of the institution’s board of directors.
Enhanced Lending Limits.  Federal banking law limits a national bank’s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons to an amount that does not exceed certain thresholds. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions.
The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act continue to impact our profitability, including limitations on fee income opportunities, increased compliance costs, imposition of more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements upon us or otherwise adversely affect our business. We cannot predict what effect any newly implemented, presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations may have on us.
Capital and Operational Requirements
The FRB, OCC and FDIC issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to U.S. banking organizations. In addition, these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels, due to its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
FNB, like other bank holding companies, through December 31, 2018 was required to maintain common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total capital (the sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital) equal to at least 6.375%, 7.875% and 9.875%, respectively, of our total risk-weighted assets (including various off-balance sheet items). The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. At December 31, 2018, our CET1, tier 1 and 
11


total capital ratios under these guidelines were 9.2%, 9.6% and 11.5%, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had $296.5 million of capital securities and subordinated debt that qualified as tier 2 capital.
In addition, the FRB has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines currently provide for a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to average total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the leverage ratio), of 4.0% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including the highest regulatory rating. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Our leverage ratio at December 31, 2018 was 7.9%.
Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision
The Dodd-Frank Act’s regulatory capital requirements are intended to ensure that “financial institutions hold sufficient capital to absorb losses during future periods of financial distress” and requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for insured depository institutions, their holding companies and non-bank financial companies that have been determined to be systemically important by the FSOC.
Basel III Capital Rules
In July 2013, FNB’s and FNBPA’s primary federal regulator, the FRB, published Basel III establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including FNB and FNBPA, compared to the then-existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. Basel III defines the components of capital and addresses other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. Basel III also addresses risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in a banking institution’s regulatory capital ratios.
Basel III, among other things, (i) introduces the concept of CET1, (ii) specifies that tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1” capital instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expands the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations.
As fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, Basel III requires FNB and FNBPA to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets (as compared to a prior minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk).
Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, banking organizations which do not use the advanced approach, such as FNB and FNBPA, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. FNB and FNBPA made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of FNB’s available-for-sale securities portfolio. Basel III also precludes certain hybrid securities, such as TPS, as tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. TPS no longer included in FNB’s tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out.
With respect to FNBPA, Basel III also revises the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under the caption “Prompt Corrective Action.”
Basel III prescribes a standardized approach for risk weightings that expands the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
12


In addition, Basel III provides more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increases the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. In November 2017, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to extend the regulatory capital treatment applicable during 2017 under Basel III for certain items, including regulatory capital deductions, risk weights, and certain minority interest limitations. The relief provided under the final rule applies to banking organizations that are not subject to the capital rules’ advanced approaches, such as FNB. Specifically, the final rule extends the current regulatory capital treatment of MSAs, DTAs arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock, and CET1 minority interest, tier 1 minority interest, and total capital minority interest exceeding applicable minority interest limitations. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, FNB and FNBPA meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements had been in effect.
In October 2017, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on simplifications to Basel III, a majority of which would apply solely to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rules. Under the proposed rulemaking, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, such as FNB and FNBPA, would apply a simpler regulatory capital treatment for MSAs; certain DTAs; investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties. Specifically, the proposed rulemaking would eliminate: (i) the 10 percent CET1 capital deduction threshold that applies individually to MSAs, temporary difference DTAs, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock; (ii) the aggregate 15 percent CET1 capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items; (iii) the 10 percent CET1 capital deduction threshold for non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions; and (iv) the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock. Basel III would no longer have distinct treatments for significant and non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, but instead would require that non-advanced approaches banking organizations deduct from CET1 capital any amount of MSAs, temporary difference DTAs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds 25 percent of CET1 capital. The proposed rulemaking also includes revisions to the treatment of certain acquisition, development, or construction exposures that are designed to address comments regarding the current definition of high volatility commercial real estate exposure under the capital rule’s standardized approach. If these are adopted as proposed, we anticipate a positive impact on our capital ratios.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as “Basel IV.” The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets, which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modelled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor.  Leadership of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC, who are tasked with implementing Basel IV, supported the revisions. Although it is uncertain at this time, we anticipate some, if not all, of the Basel IV accord may be incorporated into the regulatory capital requirements framework applicable to FNB and FNBPA.
In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the CECL model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the day-one regulatory capital effects of the CECL model. The final rule also revises the agencies’ other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. The final rule will take effect April 1, 2019. The new CECL standard will become effective for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for credit losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which we adopt the new standard, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. We also expect to incur both transition costs and ongoing costs in developing and implementing the CECL methodology, and that the methodology will result in increased capital costs upon initial adoption as well as over time.

Stress Testing
As part of the regulatory relief provided by the Economic Growth Act, the asset threshold requiring insured depository institutions to conduct and report to their primary federal bank regulators annual company-run stress tests was raised from $10 billion to $250 billion in total consolidated assets and makes the requirement “periodic” rather than annual. The amendments also provide the FRB with discretion to subject bank holding companies with more than $100 billion in total assets to enhanced supervision. Notwithstanding these amendments, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. We will continue to monitor and stress test our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of our banking regulators.
Prompt Corrective Action
FDICIA, among other things, classifies insured depository institutions into five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital-raising requirements, restrictions on its business and a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and in certain circumstances the appointment of a conservator or receiver. An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank’s compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank’s assets at the time it became ”undercapitalized” or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, the obligation under such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.
The various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA, using the total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, CET1 and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures. Such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized. Under the regulations, a “well-capitalized” institution must have a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0% and not be subject to a capital directive order. Under these guidelines, FNBPA was considered well-capitalized as of December 31, 2018.
When determining the adequacy of an institution’s capital, federal regulators must also take into consideration (a) concentrations of credit risk; (b) interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution’s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance sheet position) and (c) risks from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution’s ability to manage those risks. This evaluation is made as part of the institution’s regular safety and soundness examination. In addition, any bank with significant trading activity, must incorporate a measure for market risk in their regulatory capital calculations.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending
The CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to and investments in low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least “satisfactory” in its most recent examination under the CRA. In its most recent CRA examination, FNBPA received a “satisfactory” rating. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction.
Fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services, and the enforcement of these laws has been an increasing focus for the CFPB, HUD, and other regulators. Fair lending laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, which outlaw discrimination in credit and residential real estate transactions on the basis of prohibited factors 
14


including, among others, race, color, national origin, gender, and religion. A lender may be liable for policies that result in a disparate treatment of or have a disparate impact on a protected class of applicants or borrowers. If a pattern or practice of lending discrimination is alleged by a regulator, then that agency may refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation. In December 2012, the DOJ and CFPB entered into a Memorandum of Understanding under which the agencies have agreed to share information, coordinate investigations and have generally committed to strengthen their coordination efforts. Given recent changes in the enforcement policies and priorities of the DOJ and CFPB, the extent to which such coordination will continue to occur in the near term is uncertain. FNBPA is required to have a fair lending program that is of sufficient scope to monitor the inherent fair lending risk of the institution and that appropriately remediates issues which are identified.
Financial Privacy
In accordance with the GLB Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
Cyber Security
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cyber security programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a banking organization’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber security risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms. These enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more; however, it is possible that, if these enhanced standards are implemented, the OCC will consider them in connection with the examination and supervision of banks below the $50 billion threshold. The federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards. The OCC, however, as part of its bank supervision operational plan has prioritized review of national bank’s information security, data protection and third-party risk management, including the extent to which national banks are positioned to assess the evolving cyber-threat environment and maintain resilient defenses against such threats. 
In February 2018, the SEC announced interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cyber security risks and incidents. The guidance provides the SEC’s views about public companies’ disclosure obligations under existing law with respect to matters involving cyber security risk and incidents.  It also addresses the importance of cyber security policies and procedures and the application of disclosure controls and procedures, insider trading prohibitions, and Regulation FD and selective disclosure prohibitions in the cyber security context. FNB has reviewed and assessed the SEC guidance in connection with its business operations.
Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA PATRIOT Act
A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), which amended the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The UST has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act to financial institutions such as FNBPA. These regulations require financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. In 2016, these regulations were amended, effective May 2018, to include express requirements regarding risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. Such procedures require banks to take appropriate steps to understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships. In addition, absent an applicable exclusion, banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers at the time a new account is established. The failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, including criminal law enforcement, and reputational consequences for the institution.
15


Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The U.S. has instituted economic sanctions which affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC rules” because they are administered by the UST Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The OFAC-administered sanctions target countries in various ways. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country, and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions which relate to investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
Consumer Protection Statutes and Regulations
In addition to the consumer regulations promulgated by the FRB, OCC and state agencies, and the regulations that may be issued by the CFPB pursuant to its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act, FNBPA is subject to various federal consumer protection statutes including the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder by the CFPB and the federal banking agencies. Among other things, these acts and regulations:

• | require banks to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways;


• | prohibit discrimination against an applicant in any consumer or business credit transaction;


• | prohibit discrimination in housing-related lending activities;


• | require banks to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding loans for home purchases or improvement projects;


• | require lenders to provide borrowers with more detailed information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements;


• | prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate transactions;


• | prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations;


• | require prescribed consumer disclosures and the adoption of error resolution procedures and other consumer protection protocols with respect to electronic fund transfers; and


• | prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices in connection with consumer loans, the collection of debt, and the provision of other consumer financial products and services.

The CFPB has implemented a series of final consumer protection and disclosure rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing designed to address the Dodd-Frank Act mortgage lending protections. In particular, the CFPB issued a rule implementing the ability-to-repay and QM provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the QM Rule). The ability-to-repay provision requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the QM Rule, loans meeting the definition of QM are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting the QM requirements, and a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting the QM requirements. The definition of a “qualified mortgage” incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet underwriting guidelines of U.S. GSEs, the Federal Housing Administration and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits. Additionally, regulations governing the servicing of residential mortgages have placed additional requirements on mortgage servicers that often lengthen the process for foreclosing on residential mortgages. The CFPB also adopted integrated disclosure requirements related to mortgage originations under RESPA and TILA and each statute’s implementing regulations. These disclosure requirements became effective in October 2015. The CFPB issued proposed amendments to the requirements in July 2016, which were finalized in July 2017. The CFPB also issued interpretive guidance and updated model disclosure forms in 2017. 
As discussed, the CFPB has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agency’s jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws. As an insured depository 
16


institution with total assets of more than $10 billion, FNBPA is subject to the CFPB’s supervisory and enforcement authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. We continuously evaluate the impact of the consumer rules issued by the CFPB to determine if they will have any long-term impact on our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Compliance with these rules will likely increase our overall regulatory compliance costs and decrease fee income opportunities. The CFPB has historically been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws. The federal financial regulatory agencies, including the OCC and state attorneys general, have also become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction. We have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements. 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company, such as FNB, if the conduct or threatened conduct (including any acts or omissions) of such holding company poses a risk to the DIF, although such authority may not be used if the holding company is in generally sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act may have a material impact on FNB and FNBPA's operations, particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations.
Dividend Restrictions
Our primary source of funds for cash distributions to our stockholders, and funds used to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, is dividends received from FNBPA. FNBPA is subject to federal laws and regulations governing its ability to pay dividends to FNB, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Under federal law, the amount of dividends that a national bank, such as FNBPA, may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of its net income for the current year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years. The OCC has the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a national bank on the bases that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition to dividends from FNBPA, other sources of parent company liquidity for FNB include cash and short-term investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries.
In addition, the ability of FNB and FNBPA to pay dividends may be affected by the various minimum capital requirements previously described in the “Capital and Operational Requirements,” “Basel III Capital Rules” and “Stress Testing” discussions herein, and the capital and non-capital standards established under FDICIA, as described above. The right of FNB, our stockholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries.
Source of Strength
According to the Dodd-Frank Act and FRB policy, a financial or bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. Consistent with the “source of strength” policy, the FRB has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank or financial holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with our capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. This support may be required at times when the parent holding company may not be able to provide such support.
In addition, if FNBPA was no longer “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” within the meaning of the BHC Act and FRB rules (which take into consideration capital ratios, examination ratings and other factors), the expedited processing of certain types of FRB applications would not be available to us. Moreover, examination ratings of “3” or lower, “unsatisfactory” ratings, capital ratios below well-capitalized levels, regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors can all potentially result in the loss of financial holding company status, practical limitations on the ability of a bank or bank (or financial) holding company to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends or continue to conduct existing activities.
Financial Holding Company Status and Activities
Under the BHC Act, an eligible bank holding company may elect to be a “financial holding company” and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are financial in nature and that were not previously permissible for banks and bank holding companies. FNB is a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The financial holding company may engage directly or through a subsidiary in certain statutorily authorized activities (subject to certain restrictions and limitations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act). A financial holding company may also engage in any activity that has been determined by rule or order to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or (with prior FRB approval) complementary to a financial activity and 
17


that does not pose substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution or to the financial system generally. In addition to these activities, a financial holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company.
For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions must be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.” The FRB generally must deny expanded authority to any bank holding company with a subsidiary insured depository institution that received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent CRA review as of the time it submits its request for financial holding company status. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company under the BHC Act, the company fails to continue to meet any of the requirements for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company.
Activities and Acquisitions
The BHC Act requires a bank or financial holding company to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before:

• | the company may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than five percent of any class of voting securities of the institution;


• | any of the company’s subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or


• | the company may merge or consolidate with any other bank or financial holding company.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Interstate Banking Act) generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by a holding company of banks in more than one state. A bank is subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time and the requirement that the bank holding company, after the proposed transaction, controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by the state law of such deposits in that state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits:

• | a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank;


• | a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank; and


• | a bank to establish and operate de novo interstate branches whenever the host state permits de novo branching of its own state-chartered banks.

Bank or financial holding companies and banks seeking to engage in mergers authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be at least adequately capitalized as of the date that the application is filed, and the resulting institution must be well-capitalized and managed upon consummation of the transaction.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, national and state-chartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state (e.g., a host state) by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch. Applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator.
The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, entity or group of persons or entities acting in concert, from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company or bank unless the FRB has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction. Under FRB regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more (but less than 25%) of the voting stock of a corporation would, under the circumstances set forth in the regulations, create a rebuttable presumption of acquisition of control of the corporation.
Incentive Compensation
Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice. The federal banking agencies jointly adopted the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies intended to ensure that banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. This guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to 
18


expose the organization to material amounts of risk, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide employee incentives that appropriately balance risk in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation. Any deficiencies in the compensation practices of FNB or its subsidiaries and affiliates could lead to supervisory or enforcement action.
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as FNB, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators were required to establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The federal banking agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011 and issued a second proposed rule in June 2016. The second proposed rule would apply to all banks, among other institutions, with at least $1 billion in average total consolidated assets, for which it would go beyond the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies discussed above to prohibit certain types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers, require incentive-based compensation arrangements to adhere to certain basic principles to avoid a presumption of encouraging inappropriate risk, require appropriate board or committee oversight, establish minimum recordkeeping and mandate disclosures to the appropriate agency. In addition, institutions with at least $50 billion in average total consolidated assets would be subject to additional compensation-related requirements and prohibitions. The prospects for continued consideration of these proposed rules by the SEC and federal banking agencies are uncertain, but implementation of any final rules is not expected in the near term. Nevertheless, incentive compensation and sales practices, particularly in connection with certain products and services that are viewed as high-risk from a supervisory perspective - such as cross-selling and overdraft services - continue to be priority issues on the examination and supervision agendas of the CFPB and the federal banking agencies. 
Securities and Exchange Commission
FNBIA is registered with the SEC as an investment advisor and, therefore, is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and other applicable SEC regulations. The principal purpose of the regulations applicable to investment advisors is the protection of investment advisory clients and the securities markets, rather than the protection of creditors and stockholders of investment advisors. The regulations applicable to investment advisors cover all aspects of the investment advisory business, including limitations on the ability of investment advisors to charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to clients, record-keeping, operating, marketing and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on principal transactions between an advisor or its affiliates and advisory clients, as well as other anti-fraud prohibitions. FNBIA also may be subject to certain state securities laws and regulations.
Additional legislation, changes in or new rules promulgated by the SEC and other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of FNBIA. The profitability of FNBIA could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation, homeland security and electronic commerce.
Under various provisions of the federal and state securities laws, including in particular those applicable to broker-dealers, investment advisors and registered investment companies and their service providers, a determination by a court or regulatory agency that certain violations have occurred at a company or its affiliates can result in a limitation of permitted activities and disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities.
FNBIA also may be required to conduct its business in a manner that complies with rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, among others. The principal purpose of these regulations is the protection of clients and ERISA plan and individual retirement account assets and beneficiaries, rather than the protection of stockholders and creditors. Significantly, in June 2018, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mandate vacating the DOL's "fiduciary rule" and related prohibited transaction exemptions. As a result, although FNBPA may have taken certain measures to comply with the rule on a transitional basis, FNBPA's securities brokerage and investment advisory service and activities will no longer be affected.

Separately, in April 2018, pursuant to the study conducted by the SEC that was required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Interest, which, among other things, requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail consumer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer. We anticipate the adoption of any new rule by the SEC will require us to review and possibly modify our compliance activities, which may lead to additional costs. In addition, state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring, as well as require that we undertake additional compliance measures.
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines for Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness (the Guidelines). The Guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions. The operational and managerial standards in the Guidelines relate to the following: (1) internal controls and information systems; (2) internal audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate exposure; (6) asset growth; (7) compensation, fees and benefits; (8) asset quality; and (9) earnings. Rather than providing specific rules, the Guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution. Failure to meet the standards in the Guidelines, however, could result in a request by the OCC to one of the nationally chartered banks to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such Guidelines. Failure to provide a plan or to implement a provided plan requires the appropriate federal banking agency to issue an order to the institution requiring compliance.
Insurance Agencies
FNIA is subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the various states in which FNIA conducts its insurance agency business. These laws and regulations are primarily for the protection of policyholders. In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, those authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons, including for regulatory violations or upon conviction for certain crimes. Possible sanctions that may be imposed for violation of regulations include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time, revocation of licenses, censures and fines.
Penn-Ohio is subject to examination by the Arizona Department of Insurance. Representatives of the Arizona Department of Insurance periodically determine whether Penn-Ohio has maintained required reserves, established adequate deposits under a reinsurance agreement and complied with reporting requirements under the applicable Arizona statutes.
Other Laws and Regulations Pertaining to Banks and Financial Services Companies
FNB, FNBPA and our subsidiaries and affiliates are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations in addition to those already discussed herein with respect to the operation of our businesses, including but not limited to Expedited Funds Availability (and its implementing Regulation CC), Reserve Requirements (and its implementing Regulation D), Margin Stock Loans (and its implementing Regulation U), Right To Financial Privacy Act, Flood Disaster Protection Act, Homeowners Protection Act, Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act.
In addition, SOX addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by SOX, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under SOX have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
Governmental Policies
The operations of FNB and our subsidiaries are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates monetary policy and interest rates in order to influence general 
20


economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of all financial institutions in the past and may continue to do so in the future.
In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets, as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the FRB, it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels and loan demand, or their effect on our business and earnings or on the financial condition of our various customers (see discussion under Risk Factors - caption “We could be adversely affected by changes in the law, especially changes in the regulation of the banking industry”). 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
The TCJA includes a number of provisions that impact FNB, including the following:
Tax Rate. The TCJA replaced the corporate tax rate of 35% applicable under prior law with a reduced 21% statutory tax rate. Although the reduced tax rate generally should be favorable to us by resulting in increased earnings and capital, it decreased the value of our then-existing DTAs. The effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the tax rate was a significant item impacting earnings but is generally not expected to have a substantial adverse impact on our core earnings or capital over the long term. 
FDIC Insurance Premiums. As discussed above, the TCJA prohibits taxpayers with consolidated assets over $50 billion from deducting any FDIC insurance premiums and prohibits taxpayers with consolidated assets between $10 and $50 billion from deducting the portion of their FDIC premiums equal to the ratio, expressed as a percentage, that (i) the taxpayer’s total consolidated assets over $10 billion, as of the close of the taxable year, bears to (ii) $40 billion. As a result, FNBPA’s ability to deduct its FDIC premiums is now limited.
Employee Compensation. A “publicly held corporation” is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. The TCJA eliminated certain exceptions applicable under prior law for performance-based compensation, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals. As a result, our ability to deduct certain compensation paid to our most highly compensated employees is now limited. 
Business Asset Expensing. The TCJA allows taxpayers immediately to expense the entire cost (instead of only 50%, as under prior law) of certain depreciable tangible property and real property improvements acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023 (with an additional year for certain property). This 100% “bonus” depreciation is phased down proportionately for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2023 and before January 1, 2027 (with an additional year for certain property). 
Interest Expense. The TCJA limits a taxpayer’s annual deduction of business interest expense to the sum of (i) business interest income and (ii) 30% of “adjusted taxable income,” defined as a business’s taxable income without taking into account business interest income or expense, net operating losses, and, for 2018 through 2021, depreciation, amortization and depletion. Because we generate significant amounts of net interest income, we do not expect to be impacted by this limitation. 
The foregoing description of the impact of the TCJA on us should be read in conjunction with our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in Item 8 of this report.
