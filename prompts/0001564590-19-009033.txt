Customers
 We sell our products and services primarily to customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor integrated device manufacturing industries, and we also sell to the display, consumer, medical, energy, industrial, and research equipment industries. 
 The majority of our total revenues comes from the semiconductor capital equipment industry (OEM’s), which is highly concentrated, so we are therefore highly dependent upon a small number of customers. Our two largest customers for our equipment product revenues in fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 were Applied Materials, Inc. and Lam Research Corporation, each of which accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016. As a group, our respective year’s top two customers accounted for 76.6%, 84.4% and 82.2% of the Company’s revenues for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The composition of our most significant customers changes from time to time based on various factors, including acquisition activity by our customers. 
 Approximately 4.0% of our total revenues came from the semiconductor integrated device manufacturing industry (IDM’s). We expect this percentage to increase in fiscal 2019 with a full year of operations of QGT. This industry is not as concentrated and we have a diverse customer base with no single customer representing more than 10% of total revenues for 2018.  
 We have successfully qualified as a supplier of equipment and cleaning and analytical services with each of our customers who require it. This lengthy qualification process involves the inspection and audit of our facilities and evaluation by our customers of our engineering, documentation, manufacturing and quality control processes and procedures. Our customers generally place orders with suppliers who have met and continue to meet their qualification criteria.
 Customer Business Management
 We sell and support our products and services through our Customer Business Management organization which, consisted of customer relationship directors, managers and support staff. Our customer relationship directors are responsible for establishing sales strategy and setting the objectives for specific customer accounts. Each customer relationship manager is dedicated to a specific customer account and is responsible for maintaining strong working relationships with that customer. Customer relationship managers work closely with customers and in many cases provide on-site support. OEM Customer relationship managers often attend customers’ internal meetings 
 7


related to production and engineering design and quality to ensure that customer expectations are interpreted and communicated properly to our operations group. Customer relationship managers also work with our customers to identify and meet their cost and design-to-delivery cycle time objectives. Our IDM Customer relationship managers work with process tool owners and Fab maintenance managers relating to the development of validation of cleaning recipes, addressing new tools, and to optimize processes toward node transitions.
 We have dedicated business development managers responsible for new business development for gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems as well as our service business. Our new business development managers initiate and develop long-term, multilevel relationships with customers and work closely with customers on new business opportunities. Our customer relationship organization includes technical sales support for order placement, spare parts quotes, production status updates as well as service and maintenance contracts and analysis business. We have a technical relationship representative located at most of our manufacturing facilities. 
 We integrate new business wins into our facilities via a rigorous product transition process, working in concert with our customers to ensure all production and test requirements are identified, documented, and validated. We employ the same process at all our sites, enabling products and service offerings to smoothly transition into and between our sites as needed to support customer demand. 
 In addition, we have developed an overall service and support infrastructure to provide our customers with service and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our dedicated global field service engineers provide customer support through the performance of on-site installation, servicing and repair.
 Technology Development
 We engage in ongoing technology development efforts to remain a leader for gas delivery systems and to further develop our expertise in other critical subsystems. Our design engineering and new product engineering groups support our technology development activities. Our technology development group works closely with our customers to identify and anticipate changes and trends in next-generation equipment. Our technology development group participates in customer technology partnership programs that focus on process application requirements for gas and liquid delivery systems and other critical subsystems. These development efforts are designed to meet specific customer requirements in the areas of subsystem design, materials, component selection and functionality. Our technology development group also works directly with our suppliers to help them identify new component technologies and make necessary changes in, and enhancements to, the components that we integrate into our products. Our analytical and testing capabilities enable us to evaluate multiple supplier component technologies and provide our customers with a wide range of appropriate component and design choices for their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems.
 Our analytical and testing capabilities also help us anticipate technological changes and requirements in component features for our core UCT next-generation gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. We are developing additional features to improve the performance and functionality of our gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems. Our technology development activities for next-gen gas delivery and other critical subsystems are performed principally in Hayward, California.
 We also engage in ongoing technology development to maintain technological leadership in the cleaning, coating and analytical markets. Our QGT subsidiary works closely with customers to identify and anticipate changes that will be required in next-generation equipment. QGT service’s technical capability is becoming extremely critical and differentiated to ensure high wafer yields and throughput as geometries shrink and density increases. QGT’s development activities are performed primarily in Phoenix, AZ. 
 Our technology development and new product engineering expenses were approximately $13.3 million, $11.7 million and $9.9 million for the 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Both our products and services businesses largely 
 8


depend upon our design, engineering, manufacturing, testing, cleaning, coating and analytical know-how. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and confidentiality provisions, and to a much lesser extent, patents, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. We have four patents with various expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2034. We have no pending U.S. patents. Intellectual property that we develop on behalf of our customers is generally owned exclusively by those customers.
 We require our employees, suppliers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose to them any sensitive or proprietary information regarding our products, technology or business plans. We require employees to assign to us proprietary information, inventions and other intellectual property they create, modify or improve.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly fragmented. When we compete for new business, we face competition from other suppliers of gas delivery systems, critical subsystems, cleaning and analytical services, as well as the internal manufacturing groups of our customers. Customers that have elected to outsource their gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including cleaning and analytics, could elect in the future to develop and manufacture these subsystems internally, leading to further competition.
 Our principal competitor for gas delivery systems is Ichor Systems, Inc., and our principal competitors for other critical subsystems are Flex Ltd., Foxsemicon Integrated Technology Inc. and Celestica Inc. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products. For our services, coating and analytical offerings, our main competitors in the US are Pentagon Technologies and Cleanpart, and in Korea, KoMiCo.
 The limited number of potential customers in our industry further intensifies competition. The primary competitive factors in our industry are quality, meeting customer timeline demands, price, technology, design-to-delivery cycle time, customer qualification approvals, the development of product recipes for cleaning and analytics and historical customer relationships. We anticipate that increased competitive pressures will cause intensified price-based competition and we may have to reduce the prices of our products. In addition, we expect to face new competitors as we enter new markets. 
 Employees
 As of December 28, 2018, we had 4,280 employees, of which 443 were temporary. Of our total employees, there were 126 in engineering, 11 in technology development, 235 in sales and support, 2,861 in direct manufacturing, 690 in indirect manufacturing and 357 in executive and administrative functions. These figures include 1,706 employees in Asia and 519 employees in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory requirements and foreign laws relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous substances and waste, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the construction and operation of our UCT and QGT facilities.
 Our past or future operations may result in injury or claims of injury by employees or the public which may result in material costs and liabilities to us. Although some risk of costs and liabilities related to these matters is inherent in our business, we believe that our business is in compliance with applicable regulations. However, new, modified or more stringent requirements or enforcement policies could be adopted, which could adversely affect us.
