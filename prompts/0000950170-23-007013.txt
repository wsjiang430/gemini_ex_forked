BUSINESS
 Overview
We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on helping patients fight cancer by developing a pipeline of product candidates based on expertise in protein engineering and oncology led by the CD47 blocker, evorpacept, currently in multiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Cancer cells leverage CD47, a cell surface protein, as a “don’t eat me” signal to evade detection by the immune system. Our company is developing a next-generation checkpoint inhibitor designed to have a high affinity for CD47 and to avoid the limitations caused by hematologic toxicities inherent in other CD47 blocking approaches. We believe our lead product candidate, evorpacept, will have a wide therapeutic window to block the “don’t eat me” signal on cancer cells, and will enhance the immune activation of broadly used anti-cancer agents through combination treatment strategies. As of December 31, 2022, we had dosed over 300 subjects with evorpacept across a range of hematologic and solid malignancies in combination with a number of leading anti-cancer agents. We continue to initiate additional studies in combination with leading anti-cancer agents.

 ▪Tallac Therapeutics - ALTA-002
 oOur second program, ALTA-002, is a collaboration between us and Tallac Therapeutics, Inc. (Tallac) that combines our company’s SIRPα antibody with Tallac’s toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, resulting in a potent immune activator targeted to myeloid cells in the tumor to promote innate and adaptive anti-cancer immune responses. This novel Toll-like receptor agonist antibody conjugation platform (TRAAC) enables systemic delivery of targeted TLR9 activation.
 oAn investigational new drug (IND) filing for ALTA-002 is planned for the first half of 2023.
 Based on our preliminary clinical results to date in multiple oncology indications showing encouraging anti-tumor activity and tolerability and our clinical development plans, our strategy is to pursue evorpacept (evorpacept is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the recommended United States Adopted Name (USAN); this product is also known as ALX148) as a potentially critical component of future oncology combination treatments.
 Additionally, with our acquisition of ScalmiBio, Inc. (ScalmiBio), we are planning to expand our pipeline of drug candidates to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) based on expertise in protein engineering and oncology.

Anti-cancer agents, including many chemotherapies, other small molecules and anti-cancer antibodies, can stimulate immune cells such as macrophages to engulf and kill cancer cells, a process known as phagocytosis, by providing so-called “eat me” signals on cancer cells. In response, cancer cells frequently overexpress CD47 to counteract these “eat me” signals. As a result, high expression of CD47 on cancer cells has been associated with reduced patient survival in multiple cancers. The therapeutic blockade of CD47 in combination with an “eat me” signal enables the immune system to detect and phagocytose cancer cells. However, healthy blood cells and nearly all other cells in the body also express CD47 as a way to protect against pathologic phagocytosis by immune cells. There have been a number of approaches to blocking CD47, including monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that include an active Fc region. These approaches have encountered limitations, including limited dosing and therapeutic window, limited ability to combine with other anti-cancer agents, limited efficacy in solid tumors and limited indications due to patient selection, that have challenged their ability to maximize the full potential of CD47 blockade. In addition, most of these therapeutic approaches to CD47 blockade have resulted in the destruction of patients’ healthy blood cells, causing cytopenias that limit the dosing and therapeutic potential of those molecules.
ALX Oncology was founded by Corey Goodman, Ph.D., K. Christopher Garcia, Ph.D., and Jaume Pons, Ph.D. to address fundamental challenges in blocking CD47 and to realize the full potential of this therapeutic target. We have developed a new approach to CD47 blockade that is designed to maximize clinical activity and minimize toxicities by designing a CD47 blocker with an inactivated Fc region. Clinical data on competing CD47 blockers to date have come from molecules that incorporate an active antibody Fc region in addition to a CD47 blocking region. The Fc region provides a positive, pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal to macrophages and other cells of the immune system. Since healthy blood cells also express CD47, these competing therapeutic approaches can cause a reduction in the number of blood cells in the body, resulting in anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, which can be dangerous to patients and may limit the ability to combine these agents with other anti-cancer medicines.
Our lead product candidate, evorpacept, is a next-generation CD47 blocking therapeutic that we believe has significantly enhanced properties compared to competing CD47 blocking approaches. Evorpacept is a fusion protein that combines a high-affinity CD47 binding domain with a proprietary inactivated Fc domain. The CD47 binding domain of evorpacept is an affinity enhanced extracellular domain of SIRPα, a protein that is the natural receptor to CD47 found on myeloid cells. We have engineered the Fc domain of evorpacept so that it does not provide a pro-phagocytic signal while still maintaining an antibody-like half-life for the molecule. We believe our inactive Fc approach improves tolerability when compared to other CD47 blocking approaches that have an Fc domain that engages activating receptors on macrophages, causing phagocytosis and death of healthy cells in addition to cancer cells.
Evorpacept’s design has several advantages that we believe will make it broadly applicable to treating a number of oncology indications. Due to the inactive Fc, evorpacept is specifically designed for use in combination with other anti-cancer agents that provide a positive immune-stimulating signal. We believe evorpacept has a favorable tolerability profile that may enable higher dosing levels and greater combination potential with other leading anti-cancer agents. Additionally, the molecular weight of evorpacept is half that of a typical antibody. The relatively smaller size of our molecule may facilitate increased penetrance into the tumor microenvironment. We believe these properties may enable evorpacept to provide superior therapeutic benefits.
Clinical data to date in evorpacept have not shown dose-dependent hematologic toxicities, which are characteristic of other CD47 blockers that incorporate an active Fc domain. Over 300 subjects have been treated with evorpacept in combination with targeted anti-cancer agents, small molecules, and checkpoint inhibitors as of December 31, 2022. Evorpacept has not reached a maximum tolerated dose in any of the combinations evaluated to date.
In our first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1b trial of evorpacept in combination with an anti-CD20 agent, rituximab, to treat subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL, evorpacept demonstrated a higher response rate at higher doses and achieved a 70.0% objective response rate, or ORR, in the highest dose (15 mg/kg once per week, or QW) cohort as compared to a 40.9% ORR at the lower dose (10 mg/kg QW) cohort. We view this ORR as compelling evidence for the role of evorpacept in treating hematologic malignancies and as a favorable comparison to outcomes reported by other CD47 blocking agents in a similar patient population. Furthermore, other CD47 blocking agents in development have demonstrated clinical evidence supporting the role of CD47 blockade in treating hematologic malignancies, specifically in both MDS and AML, albeit with high rates of cytopenias. We initially conducted preclinical studies of evorpacept combined with azacitidine or venetoclax that support our clinical development plan in MDS and AML. Azacitidine is a standard of care agent for the treatment of MDS. Azacitidine and venetoclax are both standard of care regimen components for the treatment of AML in older patients and those who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy due to comorbidities. We have conducted preclinical studies that show that azacitidine and venetoclax increase both the display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin and the “don’t eat me” signal CD47 on AML cells, suggesting that a CD47 blocking agent could maximize the activity of venetoclax and azacitidine in these models. Additionally, we have shown that azacitidine and evorpacept in combination produce increased phagocytosis in vitro and anti-tumor activity in mouse models compared to azacitidine alone.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that combination treatment of evorpacept with azacitidine and/or venetoclax leads to tumor elimination and prolonged survival in leukemia mouse models. In October 2020, the first subjects received evorpacept in ASPEN-02, a Phase 1b/2 trial in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of subjects with higher-risk MDS. Initial Phase 1a clinical data from the ASPEN-02 trial was presented at the 63rd ASH Annual Meeting in December 2021. Preliminary data demonstrated the combination was well tolerated with no maximum tolerated dose reached. Early anti-cancer activity was seen with complete response (CR) in 2 out of 5 patients with previously untreated TP53 higher-risk MDS as well as 5 marrow CR out of 9 patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Additional patients with newly diagnosed higher-risk MDS will be evaluated in the dose optimization portion of the study. We also advanced evorpacept into a Phase 1/2 trial (ASPEN-05) in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax for the first-line treatment of subjects with AML in October of 2021. Preliminary data from the dose escalation portion of this study was presented at the 64th ASH Annual Meeting in December 2022. Preliminary data demonstrated the combination was well tolerated with no maximum tolerated dose reached. Early antileukemic activity was seen with 1 CR, 1 CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), and 1 morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) out of 3 patients with previously untreated AML. In addition, 4 out of 10 patients with relapsed or refractory disease demonstrated an objective response (2 CRi and 2 MLFS). Additional patients will be enrolled into the ASPEN-05 AML dose optimization portion of the study once dose optimization data is available from the ASPEN-02 MDS study.
 Evorpacept has also generated clinical data in solid tumors in various combinations, including with a leading tumor antigen targeting antibody, a leading checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy. We believe that evorpacept induces multiple responses that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. We are investigating evorpacept for the treatment of advanced HNSCC, HER2-positive advanced gastric/GEJ carcinoma, and HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors. In the FIH Phase 1b clinical trial, evorpacept demonstrated both objective clinical response per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, criteria and tolerability in combination with other broadly used cancer agents. Based on these results, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab, platinum, and fluorouracil for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC in February 2020 and for evorpacept in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2 overexpressing advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior trastuzumab, and fluoropyrimidine or platinum-containing chemotherapy in January 2020. While other CD47 blockers have failed to achieve meaningful clinical activity in the treatment of solid tumors, we believe evorpacept’s properties, including favorable tolerability and ability to escalate to higher doses, coupled with high affinity and small size for enhanced solid tumor penetration, may underlie the observed anti-tumor activity in solid tumors.
 In 2021, we advanced evorpacept into two distinct randomized Phase 2 trials in patients with previously untreated advanced HNSCC in combination with pembrolizumab, marketed as KEYTRUDA, the market leading anti-programmed cell death protein-1, or PD-1, checkpoint inhibitor, with or without chemotherapy. These trials are being conducted in collaboration with Merck. In 2022, we advanced evorpacept into randomized Phase 2 trials in subjects with previously treated advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ carcinoma in combination with trastuzumab, marketed as HERCEPTIN, the market-leading anti-HER2 antibody, with the second line standard of care, ramucirumab, marketed as CYRAMZA, plus paclitaxel. These trials are being conducted in collaboration with Eli Lilly. In January 2022, the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development granted ODD to evorpacept for the treatment of patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. We entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks to initiate a Phase 1 trial of evorpacept in combination with Zymeworks’ HER2-targeted bispecific antibody zanidatamab for the treatment of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors and the first patient was enrolled in October of 2021. Zymeworks recently entered into a license agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Jazz exercised its option to continue with its exclusive license to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in the United States, Europe, Japan and other certain territories. In August 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative who will sponsor and manage a Phase 1 trial (I-SPY) to evaluate evorpacept in combination with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer. In our collaborations with Merck, Eli Lilly, Zymeworks, and Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative, we have maintained worldwide commercial rights to evorpacept.
 Our team of industry veterans plans to continue to advance a broad development plan for evorpacept that balances speed to market, scale of unmet need and existing clinical evidence for evorpacept’s combination mechanisms. Members of our management team have brought multiple drugs to the FDA approval. Our President, Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jaume Pons, Ph.D., was Chief Science Officer of Rinat (a subsidiary of Pfizer), invented fremanezumab (FDA approved in 2018), tanezumab (Biologics License Application, or BLA, filed in 2020) and additional antibodies in late-stage development at Pfizer and advanced nine more drugs into human trials. Our Chief Medical Officer, Sophia Randolph, M.D., Ph.D., was the global clinical franchise lead for IBRANCE at Pfizer, where she oversaw the program from first-in-human trials to initial global regulatory approval. Our Executive Chairman and founder, Corey Goodman, Ph.D., an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, has co-founded seven biopharmaceutical companies, including Exelixis and Labrys (acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2014), and led Pfizer’s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center. Our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Garcia, has over 25 years of experience guiding public and private life science companies and has raised over $2.0 billion in debt and equity offerings. We have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance and sale of our convertible preferred stock, the issuance and sale of our common stock through an initial public offering in July 2020 and a follow-on public offering in December 2020, and a term loan facility in October 2022.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to transform treatment options for patients with cancer by developing evorpacept as a foundational checkpoint immunotherapy.
Key elements of our strategy to support this goal include:
▪Expanding the therapeutic potential of CD47 blockade into solid tumors. We believe evorpacept can overcome the limitations of other CD47 blocking approaches in solid tumors. Based on encouraging early Phase 1 clinical data in our ASPEN-01 study in subjects with advanced HNSCC treated with evorpacept in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor with and without chemotherapy, we are conducting two randomized Phase 2 trials (ASPEN-03 and ASPEN-04) of evorpacept for the treatment of first-line advanced HNSCC with the first subject enrolled in the ASPEN-03 trial in May 2021 and the first subject enrolled in the ASPEN-04 trial in July 2021. We have generated encouraging Phase 1 clinical data in subjects with advanced HNSCC treated with evorpacept in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor with and without chemotherapy as well as in subjects with advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer, who have progressed on prior HER2-targeted therapy, treated in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab, and chemotherapy.
 In February 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination pembrolizumab, platinum, and fluorouracil for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC. In July 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1. In March 2022, we began a randomized Phase 2/3 trial (ASPEN-06) of evorpacept for the treatment of second and third line advanced HER2-overexpressing gastric/GEJ cancer and dosed the first patient. In January 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior trastuzumab, and fluoropyrimidine or platinum-containing chemotherapy. In January 2022, the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development granted ODD to evorpacept for treatment for gastric/GEJ cancer. Our Phase 2 studies of evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in HNSCC are designed to potentially support registration via the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway if the outcomes are positive. We have initiated a Phase 1 study (ASPEN-07) to investigate evorpacept in combination with an ADC, enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, for the second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic UC and dosed the first patient in February 2023. Additionally, Zymeworks is sponsoring and managing an ongoing Phase 1 trial of evorpacept in patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors in combination with zanidatamab and enrolled the first subject in October 2021. In August 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative who will sponsor and manage a Phase 1 trial (I-SPY) to evaluate evorpacept in combination with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer.
 ▪Advance our lead product candidate, evorpacept, through clinical development for MDS and AML. We initiated a Phase 1b/2 trial (ASPEN-02) of evorpacept, in combination with azacitidine, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated higher risk MDS who are considered suitable candidates for treatment with single-agent azacitidine in October 2020, and a Phase 1/2 trial (ASPEN-05) in combination with venetoclax and azacitidine for treatment of patients with AML that are relapsed/refractory (Phase 1a and 1b) or previously untreated and who are not considered suitable candidates for intensive therapy (Phase 1a and 2) in October 2021. In June 2022, we paused enrollment in the ASPEN-05 AML trial based on the desire to leverage upcoming dose optimization data from the ASPEN-02 MDS study to inform dose optimization in ASPEN-05. In June 2022, the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products Development granted ODD to evorpacept for the treatment of patients with AML. We believe evorpacept combination therapies could address the significant unmet need for more active tolerable regimens in the majority of patients with AML who are not fit for intensive induction chemotherapy. While we plan to seek approval by the FDA for the use of evorpacept in higher risk MDS, and potentially AML, and may do so opportunistically for other indications in the future, there is no assurance that this approach will be successful for these as well as other indications. 
 ▪Continuing development of a pipeline of innovative therapeutics based on our protein engineering expertise and knowledge of the immune system and cancer biology. We are developing a pipeline of immuno-oncology programs that represent complementary, but differentiated, approaches to engaging the innate and adaptive immune systems. With our collaboration with Tallac, novel Toll-like receptor agonist antibody conjugation platform (TRAAC) enables systemic delivery of targeted TLR9 activation. Additionally, with our acquisition of ScalmiBio, we are planning to expand our pipeline of drug candidates to antibody drug conjugates.


▪Continuing to develop strategic partnerships to broaden the potential impact of our current and future product candidates across patient populations. In order to advance treatment options for the most patients, we have in the past and may in the future partner with other companies with complementary resources that will maximize the value of our current and future product candidates. Such partnerships may allow us to pair evorpacept and any future product candidates with other novel agents owned fully or in part by strategic partners. Partnerships may and will also help realize the full potential of our product candidates in markets where we are unlikely to pursue development or commercialization on our own. We intend to maintain significant economic interests in our product candidates and selectively consider partnership opportunities. In September 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Merck on a Phase 2 trial evaluating evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in patients with advanced head and neck cancer. In November 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks on a Phase 1 trial evaluating evorpacept with the HER2-targeting bispecific antibody, zanidatamab, in patients with advanced HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors. Zymeworks recently entered into a license agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Jazz exercised its option to continue with its exclusive license to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in the United States, Europe, Japan and other certain territories. In June 2021, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Eli Lilly on a randomized Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy of evorpacept in combination with ramucirumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients whose gastric/GEJ tumors have progressed following treatment with HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy. In August 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative who will sponsor and manage a Phase 1 trial (I-SPY) to evaluate evorpacept in combination with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer.
 Pipeline
Our initial programs are focused on targeting CD47 across various oncology indications. Many forms of cancer use CD47 expression as a means of evading immune response. We are targeting solid tumor and hematologic malignancies indications where we believe we have the greatest potential to address unmet medical needs.
The chart below summarizes the development status of our product candidate pipeline.



We also have a preclinical program focused on developing ALTA-002, a SIRPα TRAAC that may offer additional ways to engage the innate and adaptive immune response to cancer. An IND for ALTA-002 is planned for the first half of 2023.


CD47 Scientific Background
Cancer immunotherapies targeting adaptive immune system checkpoints, notably those related to T cells, have transformed the standard of care in oncology across multiple cancer types. Initial clinical successes in this area have focused on stimulating the adaptive immune system. However, emerging evidence demonstrates that the innate immune system plays a crucial role in the first line of defense to eliminate transformed malignant cells and the subsequent activation of the adaptive immune system. Dendritic cells and macrophages are a type of myeloid cell and are important parts of the innate immune system. These cells eliminate cancer cells by phagocytosis and present tumor-derived antigens to T cells, a process known as cross-priming, which activates the adaptive immune system.
Cancer cells evade phagocytosis by up-regulating CD47, a transmembrane protein that mainly functions as an anti-phagocytic “don’t eat me” signal for healthy cells. CD47 interacts with its cognate receptor SIRPα, a regulatory membrane glycoprotein, that is expressed on macrophages and other myeloid cells and serves to prevent phagocytosis when bound to CD47. By overexpressing CD47, cancer cells are able to avoid phagocytosis by macrophages and thereby evade subsequent detection by the adaptive immune system.
High CD47 expression in cancer cells has been shown to be a prognostic indicator of decreased survival in multiple oncology indications. A study published by Majeti, et al. in 2009, assessed this association in a validation cohort of 137 subjects with AML. As shown in the figure below, normal karyotype AML, or NK-AML, subjects with high levels of CD47 expression had shorter median overall survival, or mOS, of 9.1 months compared to subjects with low levels of CD47 expression who had an mOS of 22.1 months.



CD47 as a therapeutic checkpoint target
Data generated by our and other studies in the field have demonstrated that activating the immune system against cancer requires both blocking phagocytosis checkpoints and inducing pro-phagocytic signals. This can be achieved by combining CD47 blockade with either conventional chemotherapies or targeted therapies, which together promote phagocytosis by macrophages and maximize adaptive immune system response.
Existing anti-cancer therapeutics can increase “eat me” signals on cancer cells. For example, the hypomethylating agent, or HMA, azacitidine activates the immune system by increasing display of calreticulin, a multifunctional protein, on cancer cells. Calreticulin is an important example of a pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal that potentiates immune response when expressed on cancer cells. Therapeutic antibodies that target tumor-specific antigens, such as the HER2 receptor, also induce cellular phagocytosis, but through a slightly different mechanism. These antibodies direct macrophages to cancer cells by binding to the tumor-specific antigen and activating the macrophage by engaging the Fcγ receptors to induce phagocytosis. However, if CD47 is not blocked, the “don’t eat me” signal can limit the activity of this mechanism. CD47 blocking therapies can therefore maximize a combination agent’s clinical efficacy by overcoming the “don’t eat me” signal that is co-opted by cancer cells.

Our lead product candidate, evorpacept, targets CD47 to maximize phagocytosis of cancer cells and activation of the adaptive immune system.



Cancer cells can also modulate their environment to suppress detection by immune cells. Overexpression of CD47 helps cancer cells avoid innate immune system detection by dendritic cells and subsequent antigen presentation to T cells, thereby limiting anti-tumor immune response. PD(L)-1 targeting immunotherapies are designed to reduce the suppression of T cells but do not address the initial evasion of the innate immune system by cancer cells. By removing the suppression of dendritic cells, CD47 blocking therapies in combination with PD(L)-1 targeted therapies can complement their T cell stimulatory activities.
 Limitations of Current Approaches to Blocking CD47
 There have been a number of approaches to blocking CD47, including monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that include an active Fc region. These approaches have encountered limitations that have challenged their ability to maximize the full potential of CD47 blockade. These include:
 ▪Limited dosing and therapeutic window: The majority of clinical data to date from other CD47 blocking agents have come from approaches that incorporate an active Fc region that provides an “eat me” signal to macrophages. Given that healthy blood cells express CD47, the presence of an “eat me” signal coupled with CD47 binding in a single-agent leads to destruction of blood cells. This mechanism is illustrated in the figure below. The trials of these other CD47 blocking agents have resulted in frequent occurrence of treatment-related cytopenias that we believe limits the therapeutic window of these agents. In addition to limiting the dosing, cytopenias can be dangerous for patients undergoing treatment for cancer as they may already have a compromised immune system related to intensive treatment regimens and disease progression.
 ▪Limited ability to combine with other anti-cancer agents: Combination therapies continue to play an important role in treating patients with cancer. Overlapping toxicities of these agents dictate which agents can and cannot be combined. The overlapping toxicity profiles of other CD47 blocking agents and most other anti-cancer agents create challenges for combination dosing. When combination dosing is possible, the therapeutic benefit of the combination is limited due to the minimal amount of the CD47 blocking agent that can be safely dosed. Moreover, many combinations are precluded entirely due to overlapping toxicity. In addition, an active Fc domain can compete with anti-cancer antibodies when used in combination treatments and can prevent such antibodies from binding with Fcγ receptors on immune cells.
 ▪Limited efficacy in solid tumors: To date, other CD47 blocking agents have failed to achieve meaningful clinical activity in the treatment of solid tumors, as the balance between managing cytopenias and maximizing efficacy may lead to tolerable doses that are too low to facilitate tumor penetration and efficacy.


▪Limited indications due to patient selection: Toxicities associated with other CD47 blocking agents may require careful patient selection when evaluating potential indications. In some cases, only subjects with lower risk of hematologic complications have been selected for treatment for other CD47 blocking agents due to drug related risk of severe cytopenias. Sponsors have chosen to initially develop these investigational medicines in indications such as MDS, where patients are often already cytopenic upon presentation and receive regular transfusions, potentially obscuring the side effects of their CD47 blocking approaches.
 


Advantages of ALX’s Approach to Blocking CD47
 We founded ALX Oncology because we believed the limitations described above would prevent CD47 blockade from reaching its full potential as a therapy for patients with cancer. From our inception, we designed evorpacept to overcome these limitations and to maximize the utility of CD47 blockade as an effective anti-cancer therapeutic for a broad range of tumors. Specifically, we believe evorpacept may provide the following significant advantages:
 ▪Broader therapeutic window: We believe evorpacept’s broader therapeutic window will allow for greater drug exposure than other CD47 blocking agents potentially translating into improved efficacy across a range of cancers, including MDS and AML, compared to other CD47 blocking agents. To date, we have not yet reached a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for evorpacept. Furthermore, flexibility in dosing has allowed for several administration schedules (weekly, bi-weekly, every three weeks, monthly) that are more amenable to combination therapy dosing schedules and potentially improve a patient’s quality of life.
 ▪Strong potential for combination with other anti-cancer agents: CD47 blocking agents are combined with other therapeutics in order to maximize their potential in treating patients with cancer. Unlike other CD47 blocking agents, evorpacept was specifically designed to be combined with other anti-cancer agents. We believe evorpacept’s favorable toxicity profile will enable it to be combined with a wider range of anti-cancer agents, including chemotherapy and cytotoxic containing regimens, compared to other CD47 blocking agents. Furthermore, we believe that evorpacept’s inactive Fc domain will neither compete with nor potentially limit the efficacy of anti-cancer antibodies when used in combination treatments.
 ▪Encouraging responses in solid tumors: Evorpacept has demonstrated encouraging FIH Phase 1b clinical data in the treatment of solid tumors. While other CD47 blocking agents have failed to demonstrate meaningful clinical activity in solid tumors, evorpacept’s differentiated properties may underlie its encouraging results. Based on the data generated with evorpacept in combination with anti-cancer antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors with and without chemotherapy, our strategy is to pursue evorpacept as a potentially important component for future combination treatment of solid tumors.


▪Broader potential indications: We believe evorpacept’s tolerability profile will allow for broad treatment of patient populations in a wide range of oncology indications. Toxicities such as cytopenias associated with other CD47 blocking agents may potentially constrain their development strategies. While initial activity of other CD47 blocking agents has been reported in indications such as MDS and AML where many patients already suffer from disease-induced cytopenias, their development in oncology indications that do not include associated cytopenias may be challenged. We believe evorpacept is well positioned to expand the therapeutic potential of CD47 blockade across a broad spectrum of hematologic and solid tumor indications.
 Evorpacept
 Our lead product candidate, evorpacept, is a CD47 blocking biologic in development as a combination therapy with other anti-cancer agents for treatment of various oncology indications, including MDS, AML, HNSCC, gastric/GEJ and breast cancer. We engineered evorpacept to maximize CD47 blockade and to avoid hematologic toxicities. We believe evorpacept enhances the efficacy of both anti-cancer targeted antibodies, numerous small molecule drugs and T cell checkpoint inhibitors and exhibits no dose-dependent cytopenias. Evorpacept has demonstrated encouraging clinical responses in combination with multiple anti-cancer regimens for both hematologic and solid malignancies.
 Other companies have pursued CD47 blocking approaches that prioritize single-agent activity, albeit with limited success. Rather than designing a molecule for monotherapy activity that has been associated with cytopenias, we designed evorpacept for use in combination with anti-cancer agents. Our product candidate exclusively blocks the “don’t eat me” pathway. A combination anti-cancer agent provides a specific pro-phagocytic signal on cancer cells. This approach may both increase the specificity to cancer cells and avoid dose-dependent destruction of healthy blood cells.
 Fusion Protein Design
 Evorpacept is a fusion protein designed to provide a high CD47 blocking potency while potentially eliminating any associated toxicities. Our fusion protein comprises an engineered CD47-binding domain of SIRPα that has been genetically linked to a modified human immunoglobulin-derived Fc domain that does not bind to Fcγ receptors. We engineered evorpacept in two important ways:
 ▪We mutated the binding domain to optimize CD47 affinity. Evorpacept binding domain demonstrates an affinity that is over 3,000 times stronger than wildtype SIRPα.
 ▪We fused the CD47-binding region of SIRPα to an inactive Fc domain. Incorporating an inactive Fc domain was intended to eliminate single-agent activation of macrophages while still maintaining an antibody-like pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile.
 The successful design of evorpacept required in-house generation of approximately 280 different protein constructs to thoroughly evaluate and optimize the impact of differing designs on multiple important evaluation criteria.
 In order to optimize evorpacept’s properties we conducted the following processes:
 Design of the high-affinity CD47 binding domain:
 ▪Optimization of binding affinity for human CD47;
 ▪Optimization of cross-reactivity to rodent and monkey CD47 to enable key translational experiments; and
 ▪Elimination of partially glycosylated sites in SIRPα to remove heterogeneity and enable consistent manufacturing.
 Design of the optimal fusion combination for PK extension:
 ▪Selection of an immunoglobulin isotype to prevent hemagglutination; and
 ▪Selection of mutations to immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, to functionally eliminate Fcγ binding and avoid associated cytopenias while maintaining neonatal Fc receptor binding that enables antibody-like PK.
 As illustrated in the figure below, evorpacept comprises:
 ▪A SIRPα binding domain optimized to bind to CD47 with high affinity at a picomolar level; and
 ▪An inactive Fc domain that reduces cytopenias while preserving the desired PK properties of antibodies with an active Fc domain.


The resulting fusion protein has approximately one-half the molecular weight of a typical antibody. Evorpacept’s lower molecular weight enables it to deliver the molar equivalent of an antibody at one half the dose. For example, a 60 mg/kg dose of evorpacept, the highest level that we have dosed to date, is approximately equivalent to a 120 mg/kg dose of an antibody. Evorpacept’s lower molecular weight may also facilitate increased solid tumor penetration and provide greater potency within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, evorpacept can be efficiently and consistently produced at high yield at commercial scale utilizing standard monoclonal antibody manufacturing techniques. We believe evorpacept’s differentiated properties potentially overcome the limitations of other CD47 blocking agents and may have utility as a combination agent in oncology.
 Our lead candidate, evorpacept, is a fusion protein that potently and selectively binds CD47 to block the SIRPα interaction.
 


Pre-Clinical Differentiation
 Our preclinical studies of evorpacept support a target product profile of favorable tolerability, the ability to be dosed at high levels and increased anti-tumor activity as compared to other CD47 blocking agents. These data include the following:
 Lack of hematologic side effects
 Our preclinical data demonstrate that CD47 blocking agents with an active Fc domain directly cause adverse hematologic side effects. To support this hypothesis, we engineered a fusion protein with a SIRPα CD47-binding domain identical to evorpacept’s binding domain but fused to an active, wild-type IgG1 Fc domain, ALX377. We administered 30 mg/kg evorpacept and 30 mg/kg ALX377 in mouse models and measured red blood cell, or RBC, platelet and white blood cell (lymphocyte, monocytes and granulocytes) counts. As shown in the figure below, mice treated with evorpacept having an inactive Fc domain showed blood count levels that were similar to the pre-dose baseline. In contrast, mice treated with ALX377 having an active Fc domain showed average decreases of 34% in RBC count, 70% in platelet count and 67% in white blood cell count three days post-dosing as compared to baseline counts.


The inactive Fc domain on evorpacept is responsible for improved hematologic tolerability in preclinical models.
 

In vitro and in vivo toxicology studies in monkeys show that evorpacept was well-tolerated at intravenous doses of up to 100 mg/kg/week in the 1-month study and up to 30 mg/kg every other week in the 3-month study with no target organ toxicity or toxicity related to the exaggerated pharmacology of evorpacept. Together, these preclinical studies demonstrate that inactivation of the Fc domain of evorpacept avoids adverse effects on normal blood cells seen on other CD47 blocking agents with an active Fc domain. They also support our expectation that evorpacept’s lack of overlapping toxicities with other anti-cancer therapies may result in fewer adverse outcomes in the clinic when combined with these therapies than combinations with conventional CD47 blocking agents.
 Evorpacept elicits superior phagocytosis in combination with anti-cancer antibodies
 The inactive Fc of evorpacept does not compete with the active Fc domain of other therapeutic antibodies for binding with Fcγ receptors on effector cells of the immune system. This fact, coupled with the high-affinity CD47 binding of our agent, results in enhanced phagocytosis from evorpacept in combination with other anti-cancer antibodies to a greater extent than other CD47 blockers. We believe this will allow us to explore evorpacept in combination with a higher number of leading anti-cancer antibodies compared to other CD47 blocking agents in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In order to investigate the potential effects of the Fc domain and CD47 binding affinity on phagocytic activity, we produced two CD47 blocking agents with either an IgG4 or IgG1 active Fc domain, based on published sequences from two other clinical CD47 blockade programs. We combined these agents and evorpacept with cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, inhibitor that is the FDA approved for several solid tumors, to assess phagocytic activity as compared to single-agent cetuximab. Both cetuximab and the active Fc domain of a CD47 blocking agent bind to the same cell surface Fcγ receptors on a macrophage, potentially creating competition. IgG1 binds to receptors with higher affinity than IgG4 does, and evorpacept’s inactive Fc does not bind. This experiment shows that CD47 blocking agents with active Fc domains and lower affinity, combined with cetuximab result in lower phagocytic activity from macrophages as compared to evorpacept with cetuximab. This experiment suggests evorpacept, the only clinical CD47 blocking agent with an inactive Fc domain and high-affinity CD47 binding, may be unique in its anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-tumor antibodies.


Evorpacept has shown superior antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, or ADCP, of solid tumor cells compared to CD47 blockers with an active Fc domain and lower CD47 affinity when combined with an anti-tumor antibody.
 


Clinical Data
 Favorable tolerability profile
 Clinical trials to date continue to support evorpacept’s differentiated approach to CD47 blockade. Evorpacept has been administered in over 300 subjects with advanced solid or hematologic malignancies, including in combination with a range of standard of care anti-cancer regimens. Based on ALX’s routine and ongoing reviews of safety data, evorpacept has been consistently well-tolerated, with low occurrences of cytopenias and other toxicities. Adverse events are reported as of April 1, 2020 for evorpacept combined with KEYTRUDA, as of September 1, 2021 for evorpacept combined with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy and HERCEPTIN plus chemotherapy, and as of October 25, 2021 for evorpacept combined with azacitidine.
 We have not yet reached a maximum tolerated dose in any trial of evorpacept and are continuing to test higher doses. Because the half-life of evorpacept is longer with higher dose levels, such dosing may allow up to every four weeks, or Q4W, administration schedule. Furthermore, evorpacept’s tolerability profile could potentially result in a broad therapeutic window. We believe its tolerability profile to date supports initiation of trials in combination with highly effective, but more toxic, standard of care agents, such as chemotherapies that can cause cytopenias. Many other CD47 blocking agents are unable to combine with these anti-cancer agents due to overlapping toxicity profiles. We believe evorpacept may be uniquely positioned in its ability to combine with standard of care agents including those with associated cytopenias.


Initial data suggests that evorpacept demonstrates a consistent tolerability profile in FIH Phase 1 trial cohorts.
 

For combination cohort of evorpacept plus KEYTRUDA, treatment related adverse events occurring in >1 subject in all histologies at 10 & 15 mg/kg QW; data as of April 1, 2020. For combination cohorts of evorpacept plus KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (5FU, platinum) or plus HERCEPTIN and chemotherapy (Cyramza, paclitaxel), all treatment related adverse events are reported; data as of September 1, 2021. For combination cohort of evorpacept plus azacitidine, treatment related adverse events occurring in >1 subject at 20 & 30 mg/kg Q2W & 60 mg/kg Q4W; data as of October 25, 2021.
 Zero to single-digit incident rates of treatment-related grade three or higher cytopenias occurred in more than 1 subject across each of the FIH Phase 1 combination cohorts in this heavily pre-treated group who are typical participants in early stage cancer trials and are often hematologically fragile at baseline. Additionally, the majority of treatment-related adverse events were of low-grade and were easily managed. Overall, evorpacept continues to be well tolerated in an advanced cancer population and can be combined with a wide range of anti-cancer therapeutics.
 All other CD47 blockers that have reported clinical data have reported high rates of both all grade and high grade cytopenias. A clinical trial of magrolimab, a competitive CD47 blockade program, in solid tumors resulted in 56% anemia in the first 48 subjects dosed, despite each subject receiving an initial priming dose to mitigate anemia. A trial of magrolimab in 68 subjects with higher-risk MDS or AML presented in November 2020 (Sallman, SITC 2020, Session 304) reported over 35% grade 3 or 4 treatment-related anemia, over 15% grade 3 or 4 treatment-related neutropenia and over 10% grade 4 treatment-related thrombocytopenia. Such a tolerability profile could present challenges to the administration of this compound as a single agent and in combination. In contrast, evorpacept’s tolerability profile may enhance the breadth of clinical development by providing better treatment options for patients with cancer.
 Clinical PK and PD Data
 Initial clinical trials have confirmed that evorpacept exhibits favorable PK, and CD47 peripheral target occupancy, or TO. Human PK following intravenous, or IV, doses of evorpacept ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg either as a single-agent, or in combination with pembrolizumab, trastuzumab or rituximab have been characterized in 159 subjects as of October 1, 2020. Evorpacept single agent PK profiles showed a trend of non-linear PK with faster clearance at lower doses and slower clearance at higher doses of 10 mg/kg QW and 30 mg/kg once every other week, or QOW, indicating saturation of target mediated clearance.
 The pharmacodynamics, or PD, following AXL148 IV infusion either as a single-agent or in combination with pembrolizumab, trastuzumab or rituximab have been characterized in 156 subjects as of October 1, 2020. Target engagement has been confirmed based on CD47 TO in peripheral blood T lymphocytes and erythrocytes measured by a flow cytometry assay. At lower doses of 0.3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg evorpacept monotherapy, dose dependent increase of TO was observed. Increased TO was observed following the subsequent IV dosing compared to the first IV dose. Complete TO in periphery across the dosing interval, where TO >85%, was observed at evorpacept single agent doses ≥3 mg/kg QW and at doses of 30 mg/kg QOW. Complete TO in periphery was observed with evorpacept at doses of 10 mg/kg QW in combination with trastuzumab, or at doses of 10mg/kg QW or 15 mg/kg QW in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel.


In our FIH Phase 1b expansion trial to date, we have observed a statistically significant positive evorpacept exposure-response relationship in subjects with NHL, HNSCC and gastric/GEJ cancer. While our data support full TO in the periphery at 10 mg/kg, enhanced tumor penetration may explain the higher response rate seen at 15 mg/kg in the clinic. Given the favorable tolerability observed to date at doses up to 15 mg/kg QW, we are evaluating these higher doses of evorpacept, with a flexible dosing schedule of weekly, every other week, every three weeks, or every four weeks, to match the standard of care.
 Evorpacept in Solid Tumors
 We have generated clinical data with evorpacept in combination with multiple anti-cancer agents in solid tumors. We believe the smaller molecular weight of evorpacept as compared to a typical antibody may facilitate greater penetration into solid tumors. In addition, we believe the favorable tolerability profile of evorpacept will allow for higher administered doses in a range of combination strategies with leading therapies for solid tumors. Solid tumors represent the largest markets within oncology and many of these oncology indications are poorly served by current therapies, both in front-line as well as in the relapsed and refractory settings. We have demonstrated proof of concept with evorpacept in combination treatment in two solid tumor settings in the FIH Phase 1 clinical trial: HNSCC and HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. We believe these indications offer registration pathways in combination with existing approved therapies and have advanced evorpacept into randomized Phase 2 trials (ASPEN-03 and ASPEN-04) in HNSCC in 2021, and initiated a randomized Phase 2 trial (ASPEN-06) in HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer in 2022.
 Evorpacept can be combined with PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-(L)1, agents in a broad range of solid tumors. As part of our development strategy, we are exploring the use of evorpacept in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor with and without chemotherapy in HNSCC. PD-(L)1 inhibitors are currently approved by the FDA for over 20 indications and had over $30 billion in 2021 sales. Other CD47 blocking approaches may be limited in their ability to combine with PD-(L)1 inhibitors due to cumulative or overlapping toxicities.
 We investigated evorpacept in subjects with solid tumors in additional cohorts as part of an extensive Phase 1 FIH trial. Part 1 was a dose escalation trial of single-agent evorpacept intended to examine tolerability and recommended dosing and was not expected to show single-agent activity. Sixteen subjects with solid tumors received evorpacept as a single-agent on a QW schedule at doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg and 12 subjects received evorpacept as a single-agent on a QoW dosing schedule at a dose of 30 mg/kg. The maximum tolerated dose was not determined on either schedule. However, the maximum administered dose was 30 mg/kg for the Q2W dosing schedule and 10 mg/kg for the QW schedule.
 FIH Phase 1 Part 2 was comprised of evorpacept escalation and expansion cohorts. In subjects with solid tumors, evorpacept was combined with various anti-cancer agents including pembrolizumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Adverse events from these cohorts are reported above. As previously discussed, evorpacept has consistently displayed a favorable tolerability profile. Many of the reported adverse events have been associated with either pembrolizumab or trastuzumab.
 In HNSCC, our initial FIH Phase 1b expansion trial combined evorpacept with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 agent, which is a standard of care for subjects with HNSCC. Final results from the cohort of evorpacept combined with pembrolizumab were reported at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology, Virtual Scientific Program, or ASCO 2020, and provided the first demonstration of evorpacept’s ability to enhance checkpoint inhibitor antibody activity in solid tumors and is the basis for the FDA granting Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab, platinum, and fluorouracil for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC (February 2020). Data from this trial supported our second trial in HNSCC that adds chemotherapy (5-fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin) to the combination of pembrolizumab and evorpacept and preliminary data for this cohort was presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting, or SITC 2020. We also recently entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Merck to study the combination of evorpacept and pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in a randomized Phase 2 trial.
 In HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer, our FIH Phase 1b expansion trial included a combination with trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 agent, that is the standard of care for subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer and is FDA-approved for other HER2-expressing tumors. Final results from the cohort of evorpacept combined with trastuzumab were reported at ASCO 2020 and provided the first demonstration of evorpacept activity with an anti-tumor targeted antibody in subjects with solid tumors. Data from this trial formed the basis for the FDA granting Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior trastuzumab, and fluoropyrimidine or platinum-containing chemotherapy (January 2020). Preliminary data for this cohort was also presented at SITC 2020. In January 2022, the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development granted Orphan Drug Designation to evorpacept for the treatment of patients with gastric/GEJ cancer.
 In July 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1


In 2021, an IST of evorpacept was initiated in combination with rituximab and lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with indolent and aggressive NHL at MD Anderson Cancer Center. In 2022, an IST of evorpacept was initiated in combination with pembrolizumab and cetuximab for the treatment of patients with refractory microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer at the University of Colorado.
 Overall, we believe our development plan for evorpacept in solid tumors has significant potential and represents a strong complement to our program in hematologic malignancies. With encouraging data in multiple drug combinations initially evaluated in the clinic, we plan to advance trials to assess efficacy in the solid tumor indications with substantial unmet medical need.
 Evorpacept in HNSCC
 Disease background
 There are estimated to be over 38,000 people living in the United States with metastatic HNSCC, with over 50,000 newly incident cases at all stages estimated to be diagnosed in 2020. Five-year survival is 85% for patients diagnosed with localized disease but decreases to only 40% for those diagnosed with metastatic disease, underlying the need for improved treatment options.
 FDA-approved and National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recommended therapies for the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic disease include pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy, platinum and fluorouracil, and cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, combined with chemotherapy among other treatments. The KEYNOTE-048 clinical trial led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1 on a Combined Positive Score, or CPS, ≥1 and approval of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with HNSCC regardless of CPS. In KEYNOTE-048, pembrolizumab monotherapy achieved 17% ORR with a median progression-free survival, or mPFS, of 2.3 months in subjects with HNSCC regardless of CPS. Of particular note, in subjects with CPS <1 pembrolizumab monotherapy only achieved a 5% ORR.
 Pembrolizumab monotherapy in previously treated HNSCC was reported in the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-040 trial. Subjects were excluded if they had prior therapy with an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. In KEYNOTE-040, pembrolizumab achieved a 15% ORR, mPFS of only 2.1 months and mOS of 8.4 months. While we believe pembrolizumab is an important treatment option for both first- and second-line HNSCC, the majority of patients do not have an objective response to pembrolizumab-based therapy.
 Despite the recent approval of pembrolizumab, we believe that there is significant unmet need remaining for patients with HNSCC. The addition of evorpacept to pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, may have the potential to improve response rates and provide additional clinical benefit to patients with metastatic HNSCC. We have evaluated evorpacept in subjects with metastatic HNSCC and continue to develop evorpacept in this setting.
 Trial design
 Evorpacept was investigated in two combinations and lines of therapy in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. First, evorpacept was investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC who had received at least one prior systemic therapy. The clinical evaluation of evorpacept in HNSCC was an open-label, multisite expansion of our FIH Phase 1 trial to assess safety and tolerability with response rate and duration as secondary endpoints. There was no requirement for PD-L1 expression. Subjects received evorpacept 10 mg/kg QW in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg on a Q3W dosing schedule. Subject response was evaluated based on RECIST version 1.1. Twenty subjects were dosed with evorpacept and as of October 1, 2020, all subjects in the evorpacept with pembrolizumab HNSCC expansion cohort were response evaluable. Because standard of care in first-line HNSCC was evolving during the course of this trial to include checkpoint inhibitors, 50% (10) of the subjects who enrolled were checkpoint inhibitor naïve and 50% (10) had previously received a checkpoint inhibitor.
 Additionally, evorpacept was investigated in the ongoing trial of evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab, 5FU and platinum therapy in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC who had received no prior treatment for advanced disease. As of September 1, 2021, 13 subjects had been dosed and were response evaluable.


Outcomes
 ▪The primary objective of the FIH Phase 1 trial was to assess safety. Final results of the fully enrolled evorpacept with pembrolizumab cohort and partially enrolled evorpacept plus pembrolizumab and chemotherapy cohort were reported at SITC 2020. As reported above in the summary tables of treatment-related adverse events from all evorpacept trials, the combination was well tolerated. As of October 1, 2020, evorpacept with pembrolizumab achieved an ORR of 40% (4/10) in checkpoint inhibitor naïve subjects while maintaining a tolerability profile consistent with earlier trials. Some of the 20 subjects had a CPS of zero and a response was also observed within this subject population. We believe the addition of evorpacept to pembrolizumab represents a potentially significant advance over pembrolizumab monotherapy based on a review of the KEYNOTE-040 trial results that showed an ORR of 15% in a similar checkpoint inhibitor therapy naïve population. Based on our clinical trial data, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab, platinum, and fluorouracil for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC (February 2020).
 ▪Updated results for evorpacept with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were reported at SITC 2021. As of September 1, 2021 in the thirteen evaluable subjects with first line (1L) HNSCC who have not received prior treatment for their advanced disease, evorpacept demonstrated an initial ORR of 38.5% with a 12-month OS rate of 87.5% and mOS not reached. These results compare favorably with benchmark survival data from standard pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the 1L HNSCC setting where ORR is a less reliable predictor for clinical benefit compared to longer-term metrics such as 12-month OS rate and mOS (the gold standard of clinical benefit) in patients with aggressive disease.
 

Data cutoff September 1, 2021. NR = not reach. ND = not done. OR = objective response. mPFS = median progression free survival. mOS = median overall survival. CI = confidence interval.
 Data updated as of February 1, 2022. NC = not calculable, (95% CI)
 1L HNSCC: mOS not reached (CI: 5.99-NC) with median follow up of 15.8 months (CI: 5.0-17.8)
 ≥2L HNSCC (CPI-Naïve): mOS of 24.6 months (CI: 3.13-NC) with median follow-up of 35.3 months (CI: 27.0-41.0)
 We also analyzed paired pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies from subjects for the presence of CD8+ T cells, CD68+ and CD163+ myeloid cells. After treatment with evorpacept, tumor samples showed increased infiltration of CD8+, CD68+ and CD163+ cells in the tumor, which suggests that evorpacept also engages the innate and adaptive immune system consistent with its mechanism of action.


Clinical development plan
 Our HNSCC development plan is to build on the initial results of evorpacept in checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients in combination with pembrolizumab. Given the results of KEYNOTE-048, we expect pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, to continue to be widely used in the first-line treatment of metastatic HNSCC. Therefore, our future plans will be focused on establishing additional efficacy, in the context of acceptable safety and tolerability, over pembrolizumab alone, and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, in the front-line metastatic HNSCC setting at investigational sites in the USA, Canada, UK, Europe, and Asia Pacific region. In September 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Merck to evaluate evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in two randomized international Phase 2 trials in subjects with HNSCC who have not received prior therapy for advanced disease. The first trial (ASPEN-03), with the first patient enrolled in May 2021, is evaluating the efficacy of evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with PD-L1 expressing metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC. The second trial (ASPEN-04), with the first patient enrolled in July 2021, is evaluating evorpacept in combination with pembrolizumab and standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC. In December 2020, the FDA informed us, that given our planned initiation of two randomized Phase 2 HNSCC clinical trials that could be potentially registrational, it required completion of a routine non-clinical safety study that was currently in process. The FDA noted that for any drug development program moving swiftly through development, this non-clinical study is required prior to the initiation of a clinical trial that could be considered pivotal. As a component of the partial clinical hold, the FDA imposed a cap on patient enrollment to 50 patients across the two randomized Phase 2 studies (ASPEN-03 and ASPEN-04). We completed the required routine non-clinical safety study and in June 2021, the FDA reviewed the study and lifted the partial clinical hold and cap on patient enrollment on the two studies. Patient enrollment and clinical trial timelines were not impacted in either study by the partial clinical hold / enrollment cap.
 

Evorpacept in HER2-Positive Gastric/GEJ
 Disease background
 Over 25,000 people are estimated to be living in the United States with diagnosed metastatic gastric/GEJ carcinoma. A large, international Phase 3 trial of trastuzumab in gastric/GEJ cancer found that of the nearly 4,000 subjects screened for inclusion in the trial, 17% of them were HER2-positive, which suggests a general HER2-positive rate for patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. In East Asian countries, gastric/GEJ cancer is much more common than in the United States, with incidence rates 4-10 times higher. China alone has a diagnosed incidence of over 900,000 patients with gastric/GEJ cancer per year.


First-line standard of care treatment includes trastuzumab combined with the chemotherapy agents platinum and fluoropyrimidine with or without a checkpoint inhibitor. Trastuzumab, marketed as HERCEPTIN, is an anti-HER2 antibody that has multiple FDA approvals in patients with HER2-positive cancers. A standard of care regimen in the U.S. is ramucirumab, marketed as Cyramza, a vascular endothelial growth factor 2 receptor monoclonal antibody, in combination with paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapy, regardless of HER2 expression. In a Phase 3 trial leading to FDA approval, ramucirumab plus paclitaxel achieved a 28% ORR with a 9.6 month mOS in subjects with previously treated gastric/GEJ cancer. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, marketed as ENHERTU, is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate that is FDA approved for patients with HER2-overexpressing gastric/GEJ cancer who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen.
 HER2-positive patients with gastric/GEJ cancers in second-line treatment are likely to have received an anti-HER2 antibody-based treatment in their first line of treatment. A prospective clinical trial studied trastuzumab plus paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone in previously treated HER2-positive subjects with gastric/GEJ cancer. Subjects were required to have progressed during the first line of treatment with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (fluoropyrimidine plus platinum). The objective of this trial was to assess the clinical effect of trastuzumab after patients had progressed on prior trastuzumab treatment. The trial results showed that the addition of trastuzumab added no meaningful clinical benefit over paclitaxel alone. There was no significant improvement in mOS, mPFS or ORR compared to the paclitaxel arm. Based on these data, we hypothesized that we could attribute observed responses when treating a similar subject population with evorpacept paired with trastuzumab, to a combination effect of the two agents and not simply a response to trastuzumab alone.
 Trial design
 Evorpacept was investigated in two combinations in subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer in the Phase 1 FIH study. First, evorpacept was investigated with trastuzumab in subjects with relapsed/refractory HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. This trial was an open-label, multisite expansion of our FIH Phase 1 trial to assess safety and tolerability with response rate and duration as secondary endpoints. Twenty subjects from the gastric/GEJ expansion cohort received evorpacept 10 mg/kg QW in combination with trastuzumab at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg intravenous infusion Q3W. As of October 1, 2020, 19 subjects were response evaluable. One of the twenty subjects administered evorpacept discontinued the trial due to clinical symptoms of progression prior to their first scheduled on trial scan and therefore was not response evaluable per protocol definition.
 As of October 1, 2020, in our trial of evorpacept plus trastuzumab, 18 of 19 response evaluable subjects from the gastric/GEJ expansion cohort, including all subjects who achieved a response, had been treated with at least one HER2-containing regimen prior to enrollment. Multiple subjects also received an investigational anti-HER2 agent and a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor as prior treatment.
 Additionally, evorpacept was investigated with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel in subjects with relapsed/refractory HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer who had progressed on prior trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine or platinum in the FIH Phase 1 study. As of September 1, 2021, 18 subjects had enrolled, all of whom were response evaluable.
 Outcomes
 




Data cutoff October 1, 2020 for evorpacept plus trastuzumab trial and September 1, 2021 for evorpacept with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel. ORR = Overall Response Rate. DOR = duration of response. mPFS = median progression free survival. mOS = median overall survival. CI = confidence interval. ND = Not Done. HER2 Score retrospectively assessed using archival tissue by a central IHC lab.
 The primary objective of the FIH Phase 1 trial was to assess safety and the combination regimen was well tolerated. Results of the fully enrolled evorpacept + trastuzumab cohort were reported at SITC 2020, and the fully enrolled evorpacept + trastuzumab + ramucirumab + paclitaxel cohort were reported at SITC 2021. Importantly, evorpacept with trastuzumab achieved an ORR of 21.1% (4/19) in subjects treated with the doublet and an ORR of 72.2% (13/18) in subjects treated with evorpacept with trastuzumab, ramucirumab, and paclitaxel. The FDA granted Fast Track designation for evorpacept in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab, and paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior trastuzumab, and fluoropyrimidine or platinum-containing chemotherapy (January 2020) partly due to the data with evorpacept in combination with trastuzumab alone for the treatment of gastric cancer. In January 2022, the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development granted Orphan Drug Designation to evorpacept for the treatment of patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. Based on prior studies, one of which is described above, observed responses can likely be attributed to the combination effect and not a response to single-agent trastuzumab. As described above, ramucirumab and paclitaxel in a second-line setting resulted in an ORR of 28% in a Phase 3 trial leading to FDA approval. We believe that an ORR of 72.2 % in this second-line or later population supports further development of evorpacept in HER2-positive cancers.
 Clinical development plans
 We have initiated an international randomized Phase 2 trial of evorpacept with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer with disease progression on or after prior trastuzumab (or other HER2-directed therapy), and fluoropyrimidine or platinum-containing chemotherapy as the first line of therapy for advanced disease, in the first quarter of 2022. This study will be conducted at investigational sites in the USA, UK, Europe, and Asia Pacific region. Data from this trial would confirm whether evorpacept improves the response rate to anti-HER2-based therapy in patients with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. Of note, there are multiple emerging agents, predominantly antibody-based therapies, in development for patients with HER2-positive cancer. Because these agents target HER2 as does trastuzumab, we believe that evorpacept has the potential to maximize the anti-cancer activity of these novel agents should they supplant trastuzumab in the treatment paradigm for these patients, however, clinical trials may be required to demonstrate this.



Evorpacept in HER2-expressing breast cancer and other solid tumors
 We plan to continue developing evorpacept in a broad range of tumor types and in novel combinations. In November 2020, we announced a clinical trial collaboration with Zymeworks to investigate evorpacept in combination with Zymeworks’ HER2-targeted bispecific antibody, zanidatamab, in patients with advanced HER2-expressing tumors.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Zymeworks will sponsor and manage an open label, multi-center Phase 1b trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of zanidatamab and evorpacept in a two-part trial. The first part of the trial will evaluate the safety of the combination treatment. The second part of the trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of the combination in separate cohorts of subjects with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, HER2-low breast cancer and non-breast HER2-expressing solid tumors. The first patient in this trial was enrolled in October 2021. Zymeworks recently entered into a license agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals who exercised their option to continue with an exclusive license to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in the United States, Europe, Japan and other certain territories.
 In August 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative who will sponsor and manage a Phase 1 trial (I-SPY) to evaluate evorpacept in combination with fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer.
 Clinical Development of evorpacept in Hematologic Malignancies
 The potential therapeutic role of CD47 blockade to date has been demonstrated in hematologic malignancies. This includes both our trials of evorpacept as well as trials by other CD47 blockade programs. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial (ASPEN-02) of evorpacept in patients with MDS in 2020 and in 2021 initiated a Phase 1 trial (ASPEN-05) in patients with AML based on our initial trials in the relapsed/refractory NHL clinical setting, preclinical studies and evidence for the clinical utility of the CD47 blockade from other programs.
 NHL Proof-of-Principle
 Evorpacept’s initial hematologic clinical trial was a FIH Phase 1b expansion trial in combination with rituximab to treat subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL. This was an open-label, multisite trial to assess safety. Subjects received evorpacept 10 mg/kg QW or 15 mg/kg QW in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion QW for four doses followed by once monthly for eight doses. In order to meet inclusion criteria, subjects must have had no curative therapy or standard approved therapy option available to them. Across all cohorts, as of October 1, 2020, subjects had received a median of three lines of therapy prior to enrollment in the evorpacept trial. These were heavily pre-treated subjects, all of whom had progressed on previous rituximab-containing regimens.
 Responses were evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 response criteria and reported as of October 1, 2020. As of October 1, 2020, evorpacept had been administered to 33 subjects. Thirty-two subjects were response evaluable. Eleven subjects had indolent lymphomas and 22 had aggressive lymphomas. There were 11 subjects enrolled to the higher dose 15 mg/kg QW cohort, 10 of whom were response evaluable. This cohort achieved an ORR of 70.0% (7/10). The ORR reported in the lower dose 10 mg/kg QW cohort was 40.9% (9/22).

 We view evorpacept’s initial activity in heavily pre-treated subjects with NHL as compelling evidence for the role of evorpacept in treating hematologic malignancies and as a favorable comparison to outcomes reported by other CD47 blocking agents in similar subjects. We believe the initial data in our 10 and 15 mg/kg QW cohorts, which showed a statistically significant exposure-dependent response, demonstrates evorpacept’s activity and supports higher dose administration in trials for subjects with MDS.


Based on the activities seen at the 10 and 15 mg/kg QW doses coupled with a favorable tolerability profile, we proceeded to test higher doses, up to 60 mg/kg Q4W in MDS. We believe this dosing schedule may be unique among CD47 blockade programs and can potentially provide a more convenient regimen in combination with monthly azacitidine for patients. This data set also supported our decision to advance evorpacept into solid tumor indications at higher doses of 45 mg/kg once every three weeks, or Q3W, in combination with standard agents also administered Q3W.
 Evorpacept for the Treatment of MDS
 Our development of evorpacept in hematologic indications is initially focused on MDS. There are approximately 70,000 people living with diagnosed MDS in the U.S. Patients with MDS have a wide range of expected outcomes that can be estimated from their Revised International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS-R, risk category. Patients with very low IPSS-R have an mOS of 8.8 years, whereas those with very high IPSS-R have an mOS of under ten months. Since nearly 75% of new cases are in patients aged 70 or older, balancing a patient’s age at prognosis with potential treatment-related impact on quality of life is important in considering treatment options. Regardless of age, treatment goals for patients with MDS are a balance of improved survival, symptom alleviation and quality of life.
 For patients with higher-risk MDS (intermediate, high and very high IPSS-R), standard of care treatments include stem cell transplant, or SCT, high and low-intensity chemotherapy regimens and HMAs. SCT is the only therapy that is potentially curative; however, the procedure is difficult to tolerate, especially for older patients, and has a non-relapse mortality rate of approximately 40% at 200 days for all patients with MDS.
 For patients who are ineligible for SCT, azacitidine, an HMA, is a standard backbone therapy for combination treatment regimens in MDS. The drug continues to be used in combination with investigational agents in a number of current MDS trials. Single-agent azacitidine is one of the few FDA-approved agents for patients with MDS. However, its FDA label indicates a complete response, or CR, rate of only 5.6% and an mOS of 2.0 years. A clinical complete response comprises normalizing peripheral blood counts, resolution of bone marrow dysplasia and reduction in the percentage of immature blood cells, or myeloblasts, to less than 5%. CD47 blockade in combination with azacitidine has shown early clinical evidence that suggests it may improve CR rates in MDS. For patients with higher-risk MDS, achieving a CR and improving overall survival are the central treatment goals. Treatment goals for patients with lower-risk MDS are different. The primary goal for those patients is resolution of cytopenias.
 Red blood cell transfusions are a key element of treatment intended to address cytopenias in patients with MDS. The majority of patients have a hemoglobin count of less than 10 g/dL and approximately one-third of patients are RBC transfusion dependent. Transfusions impose significant time and cost burdens on patients and also cause clinical sequelae such as iron overload and associated liver fibrosis and cardiomyopathy. Therefore, achieving transfusion independence is an important secondary goal of treating patients with higher-risk MDS. A competitive CD47 blocking agent has generated encouraging clinical data, however, it is associated with high rates of anemia that may require additional transfusions upon treatment initiation, mitigating any success in peripheral blood count normalization.
 The current clinical experience with CD47 blocking agents in MDS underscores the need for combination therapy to increase CR rates above that seen with standard of care azacitidine monotherapy. As previously discussed, pro-phagocytic signals in evorpacept-based combinations can be provided by drugs that increase display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin on the surface of tumor cells. We have conducted preclinical studies that show that azacitidine and venetoclax increase both the display of the “eat me” signal calreticulin and the “don’t eat me” signal CD47 on AML cells, suggesting that a CD47 blocking agent could maximize the activity of venetoclax and azacitidine in these models. Additionally, we have shown that evorpacept in combination with venetoclax or azacitidine produces increased phagocytosis in vitro and anti-tumor activity in mouse models compared to azacitidine or venetoclax alone. Furthermore, combination treatment of evorpacept with azacitidine or venetoclax led to tumor elimination and prolonged survival in leukemia mouse models. Azacitidine and evorpacept monotherapies produced moderate tumor growth inhibition with all mice succumbing to disease by day 85 post inoculation. In contrast, the combination of evorpacept and azacitidine completely eliminated tumor growth with 100% animal survival up to study termination on day 147. We have also demonstrated in preclinical studies that evorpacept when combined with venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with AML, led to tumor elimination in a leukemia tumor model.







Data from a competitive CD47 blockade program, magrolimab, further support trials of evorpacept for treatment of MDS. Magrolimab was studied both as a single-agent and in combination with azacitidine in subjects with higher-risk MDS or AML. As reported at ASCO 2020, magrolimab plus azacitidine achieved a 42% CR rate in previously untreated MDS and a 40% CR in previously untreated AML. As a single-agent, magrolimab achieved no CRs in relapsed/refractory MDS and AML, suggesting that a separate pro-phagocytic signal is required for the observed clinical activity. Despite the high rate of CRs achieved in combination, over 38% of subjects in these trials have experienced grade 3 or higher treatment-related anemia. Notwithstanding these limitations, magrolimab’s data support the potential role of CD47 blockade in treating these subjects.
 Our strategy is to pursue evorpacept as a potentially critical component for future combination treatment options for patients with higher-risk MDS. Our preclinical models, activity of evorpacept in NHL where magrolimab has reported similar data and available CD47 clinical data in this indication support a potential role for evorpacept for treatment of patients with MDS. Baseline characteristics of subjects in a recent trial of azacitidine plus venetoclax in treatment-naïve higher-risk MDS illustrated the need for therapies that do not induce cytopenias. Prior to treatment, 56% of subjects had grade 3 or higher neutropenia, 33% had grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia, 40% had grade 3 or higher leukopenia and 12% had grade 3 or higher anemia. We believe that it is important to develop a CD47 blocking therapy that does not exacerbate cytopenias that patients may already exhibit pre-treatment. Evorpacept’s tolerability profile to date suggests it may address this unmet need in patients who suffer from MDS.


Trial design
 In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 trial (ASPEN-02) of evorpacept in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of subjects with higher-risk MDS. The Phase 1b portion of the trial evaluated up to 60 mg/kg Q4W of evorpacept plus standard azacitidine in subjects with relapsed/refractory and previously untreated MDS. The Phase 1b dose expansion portion of the trial currently enrolling is evaluating 40 mg/kg Q4W and 60 mg/kg Q4W of evorpacept plus standard azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated MDS. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will assess the combination of evorpacept and azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated higher-risk MDS at investigational sites in the USA, UK, Europe, and Asia Pacific region. The primary endpoint will be complete remission rate by six months. We intend to pursue a strategy in which we will leverage the data generated from this Phase 1b/2 study to request from the FDA that evorpacept be a candidate for registration for the first line treatment of higher risk MDS.
 
Outcomes
 We announced the presentation of initial clinical data from our ongoing ASPEN-02 trial evaluating evorpacept in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with previously untreated higher-risk (HR) or relapsed or refractory (r/r MDS). The results, shared in a poster at the 63rd ASH Annual Meeting [Abstract #2601], show that the combination of evorpacept and azacitidine is active and well tolerated. As of October 25, 2021, 22 patients with either previously untreated HR or r/r MDS have been treated with evorpacept in the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the study, administered at 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 60 mg/kg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) together with standard dosing of azacitidine. Median follow-up is 3.4 months, and accrual is ongoing. Evorpacept in combination with azacitidine was well tolerated (N=22) with no dose limiting toxicities, no observed treatment related serious adverse events, and a maximum administered dose of 60 mg/kg Q4W. In 6 previously untreated HR MDS response-evaluable patients, 3 patients achieved an objective response (“OR”) (2 CR, 1 marrow CR), and 2 patients achieved stable disease (SD). Two out of 4 transfusion dependent patients achieved transfusion independence on study. Among 5 previously untreated HR MDS patients with TP53 mutation and complex cytogenetic abnormalities, 3 achieved an OR (2 CR and 1 marrow CR). 5 of 9 patients with response-evaluable r/r MDS that had progressed upon prior hypomethylating agents achieved an OR (5 marrow CRs). In addition, 2 patients achieved SD.



Evorpacept’s favorable initial tolerability profile in combination with azacitidine suggests it may be safely added without worsening cytopenias, which is particularly notable for this patient population.
 Evorpacept for the treatment of AML
 Our preclinical studies and clinical trials from competing CD47 agents support the potential role of evorpacept in the treatment of patients with AML. In the United States, there are over 35,000 people living with AML with an expected 20,000 newly diagnosed cases and over 11,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. Overall survival for patients with AML is generally worse than patients with higher-risk MDS. Median overall survival for patients with AML ranges from approximately 15 months for patients with favorable cytogenetic risk factors to less than 5 months for those with adverse risk factors. Similar to MDS, patients tend to be older with a median age at diagnosis of 68.
 First-line treatment options for patients can be broadly stratified into high-intensity and low-intensity induction regimens. High-intensity induction chemotherapy is typically cytarabine plus an anthracycline (so called “7+3”) administered over a 28-day cycle. While patients can derive long term benefit from 7+3, the risks of the regimen are substantial. 60-day treatment-related mortality from 7+3 induction have been as high as 27% and have declined to 6-8% in recent years, likely due in part to more stringent patient selection and the decreased average age of patients who receive 7+3. Patients who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy due to preference, performance status, or other reasons are likely to receive low-intensity regimens characterized by the use of HMAs, venetoclax or combined HMA plus venetoclax. In the past decade, the percentage of patients 65 and older who receive first-line high-intensity treatment has declined from approximately 70% to 40%, while the use of HMAs in this population increased from 11% to 44%. Venetoclax combined with an HMA recently received approval from the FDA for use in adults who are 75 years or older or who have comorbidities that exclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. In the Phase 3 VIALE-A trial, venetoclax achieved a 37% CR rate in combination with azacitidine and a median duration of CR of 18.0 months. Despite these results, we believe there is a significant unmet need for more effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment options for patients who are not candidates for high-intensity therapy.
 The mechanistic rationale for combining evorpacept with azacitidine in AML is similar to the rationale for MDS. Preclinical studies show that azacitidine increases the display of calreticulin, a pro-phagocytic signal, on cancer cells in AML models. The preclinical studies that support the use of evorpacept combinations in MDS also support its use in AML. Clinically, the CD47 agent magrolimab has achieved a 40% CR rate in untreated AML when used in combination with azacitidine. In a separate study in patients 65 and older with untreated AML, single-agent azacitidine as achieved a 20% CR rate. We believe this indicates CD47 agents could increase the activity of HMAs above their single-agent levels. Furthermore, our preclinical data of evorpacept in combination with venetoclax supports the combination with this agent that is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with AML.


Trial design
 We initiated a Phase 1/2 trial (ASPEN-05) of evorpacept in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax for the first-line treatment of patients with AML in 2021 and enrolled the first patient in October 2021. In June 2022, after completing enrollment of the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1, we paused enrollment based on the desire to leverage upcoming dose optimization data from the ASPEN-02 MDS study to inform dose optimization in ASPEN-05.
 
Outcomes
 We announced the presentation of initial clinical data from the Phase 1a dose escalation part of our ASPEN-05 trial evaluating evorpacept in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) or newly diagnosed (ND) AML. The preliminary results, shared in a poster at the 64th ASH Annual Meeting [Abstract #4076], show that the combination of evorpacept with azacitidine and venetoclax is active and generally well tolerated. As of October 3, 2022, 14 patients with either r/r or ND AML have been treated with evorpacept in the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the study, administered at 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg Q2W or 60 mg/kg Q4W together with standard dosing of azacitidine and venetoclax. Evorpacept in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax was generally well tolerated (N=14) with no maximum tolerated dose identified and a maximum administered dose of 60 mg/kg Q4W. In 10 relapsed or refractory AML response-evaluable patients, including 8 that had progressed after prior venetoclax treatment, all experienced a reduction in bone marrow blasts, and 4 achieved a response. In 3 newly diagnosed AML response-evaluable patients, all 3 achieved a response, including 1 CR, 1 CRi, and 1 MLFS. Additional patients with newly diagnosed disease will be evaluated in the dose optimization portion of the study, and will be enrolled once dose optimization data is available from the ASPEN-02 MDS study.

Research Programs
 We also have a preclinical program focused on developing ALTA-002, a SIRPα TRAAC, that may offer additional ways to engage the innate and adaptive immune response to cancer. SIRPα TRAAC is complementary to our CD47 blocker approach. SIRPα is expressed on myeloid cells and dendritic cells which have toll-like receptor 9, or TLR9, an intracellular receptor present in a wide variety of immune cells, including B-cells, myeloid cells and dendritic cells. TRAAC, or TLR9 agonist antibody conjugate, is designed specifically for compatibility with antibody conjugation, superior pharmacokinetics, receptor-mediated uptake, and TLR9 stimulation with the potential for intravenous administration. SIRPα TRAAC is an agonistic molecule targeting myeloid cells and directly activates them, resulting in cytokine release, antigen presentation, and initiation of a coordinated innate and adaptive immune response against cancer. An IND for ALTA-002 is planned for the first half of 2023.
 In October 2021, we acquired ScalmiBio and intend to further expand our pipeline with plans to develop new anti-cancer drug candidates based on ScalmiBio’s SHIELD technology platform; these new molecules will be designed to address unmet cancer patient needs as stand-alone therapeutics and in combination with our lead product candidate, evorpacept, a next-generation CD47 blocker designed to leverage the immune activation of broadly used anti-cancer agents through combination strategies. ScalmiBio’s SHIELD technology is designed to minimize interaction of an antibody therapeutic with normal tissue and maximize its target binding capability within tumor microenvironment. ScalmiBio’s conditional activation technology aims to increase therapeutic index by minimizing dose limiting toxicities of existing checkpoint inhibitors and other targeted anti-cancer biologics as well as enable the design of ADCs with higher drug-to-antibody ratios for improved anti-cancer activity. We also acquired ScalmiBio’s proprietary cytotoxic payloads for the development of ADCs.

 We are aware of a revoked European patent (EP 2 429 574) owned by UHN and The Hospital for Sick Children that may encompass certain therapies for the treatment of cancer using polypeptides comprising soluble human SIRPα, or a CD47-binding fragment thereof. This revoked patent related to the treatment of cancer with polypeptides comprising soluble human SIRPα, or a CD47-binding fragment thereof. This patent was revoked by the European Patent Office and UHN and The Hospital for Sick Children have appealed the decision. On October 18, 2022, a hearing was held before the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (Board of Appeal), at the conclusion of which the Board of Appeal ruled in favor of UHN with respect to the matter on appeal but remanded the case back to Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (Opposition Division) for consideration of a separate issue bearing on the validity of European patent (EP 2 429 574). The patent claims under review, if upheld by the Opposition Division, could potentially limit our ability to pursue evorpacept in certain indications in certain geographies in the future. The U.S. counterpart was recently granted as US patent 10,907,209. However, we believe that we do not infringe claims listed in this U.S. patent.

Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with Stanford University
 In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement, or the Stanford Agreement, with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University under which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain patents relating to our current product candidates, to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for use in certain licensed fields, the scope of which would include the application of the licensed intellectual property in oncology. The license granted to us in the Stanford Agreement includes an exclusive grant, subject to certain pre-existing non-exclusive or exclusive rights that Stanford retained for grant to third parties with respect to certain categories of the licensed patents in certain fields of use and retained rights by Stanford and all other nonprofit institutions to use and practice the licensed patents and technology for internal research and other nonprofit purposes. The license granted to us in the Stanford Agreement also includes non-exclusive grants to certain Stanford patents.
 In consideration for the rights granted to us under the Stanford Agreement, we paid Stanford a nonrefundable license royalty and reimbursed Stanford for past patent expenses, together totaling less than $0.1 million, and granted Stanford a specified number of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Stanford ongoing patent expenses and an annual license maintenance fee, which are nominal and will be creditable against any royalties payable to Stanford in the applicable year. We are required to make milestone payments up to an aggregate of $5.0 million in respect of a specified number of licensed products that successfully satisfy certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We recorded the first milestone payment of $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no milestones met during the year ended December 31, 2022. We also agreed to pay Stanford tiered royalties on a specified percentage of net sales made by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products at rates ranging within low single-digit percentages, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Our license, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, shall become royalty-free and fully paid-up upon the later of the date on which the last valid claim included in the exclusively or non-exclusively licensed patents expires and ten years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country.
 We may terminate the Stanford Agreement, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, at any time for any reason by providing at least 60 days’ written notice to Stanford. Stanford may terminate the Stanford Agreement if we are in breach of any provision of the Stanford Agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after written notice of such breach by Stanford. In addition, Stanford has the right to terminate the Stanford Agreement, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, if we are not diligently developing and commercializing such licensed product under certain conditions or if we fail to achieve specified development milestones for such licensed product by certain dates, subject to our extension rights.
 Other Third-Party Agreements
 We have entered into license agreements with third parties related to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including evorpacept, and SIRPα antibodies which we are exploring in our research program. In consideration of the foregoing, we have agreed to customary payment terms in these agreements, including certain milestone payments upon the achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and low single-digit royalties. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations and Commitments—License and Collaboration Agreements.”
Commercialization
 We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
 Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We rely on, and will continue to rely on, CMOs for both drug substance and drug product. Both evorpacept bulk drug substance and finished drug product are produced in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.


Our existing supply of evorpacept drug product is sufficient to complete our clinical trials through the first quarter of 2024. We plan to manufacture additional supplies with our existing CMOs to produce evorpacept drug product sufficient to complete the ongoing and planned clinical trials described in this document. We first entered into an engagement with KBI Biopharma, Inc. in 2015 for analytical method development, formulation development, bulk drug manufacturing, release and stability testing. We first entered into a drug product manufacturing agreement with Lyophilization Services of New England, Inc. (now PCI Pharma Services) in 2016 for all evorpacept drug product used in clinical trials. We subsequently entered into a drug product manufacturing agreement with Patheon UK Limited in 2022 for additional drug product production of evorpacept drug product used in clinical trials.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new product candidates is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to evorpacept and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others. We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immune-oncology therapies for the treatment of cancer. There are other companies working to develop immuno-oncology therapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. The large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer include, but are not limited to, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech.
 Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, including with respect to the targeting of CD47 pathway, and others are based on entirely different approaches. We are aware that AbbVie (through its licensing agreement with I-Mab), Akesobio, Apexigen, Bio-Thera Solutions, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Conjupro Biotherapeutics, Gilead Sciences (through its acquisition of Forty Seven), I-Mab, ImmuneOncia Therapeutics, ImmunceOnco Biopharma, Innovent, Kahr, Mabwell Therapeutics, Mabworks, Novimmune, OSE Immunotherapeutics, Pfizer (through its recent acquisition of Trillium Therapeutics), Shattuck Labs, SinoBiological, Sorrento Therapeutics, TG Therapeutics, Waterstone, and Zai Lab, among others, are developing drugs targeting the CD47 pathway that may have utility for the treatment of indications that we are targeting. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA, regulates biologic products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. Biologic products and substances are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.


The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
 U.S. Biologics Regulation
 Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
 The process generally involves the following:
 ▪Completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation.
 ▪Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made.
 ▪Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced.
 ▪Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety, purity and potency (i.e., safety and effectiveness) of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose.
 ▪Compliance with PREA, BPCA and FDARA regarding development of certain molecularly targeted oncology drugs for pediatric use.
 ▪Preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials.
 ▪A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review.
 ▪Satisfactory completion of any FDA audit of preclinical studies and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA.
 ▪Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs.
 ▪Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable.
 ▪FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 ▪FDA review and approval of the combination partner NDA/BLA to address any necessary cross-labeling requirements to permit commercial marketing of the combination product for the particular indications for use in the United States.
 ▪Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 Preclinical and Clinical Development
 The data required to support a BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, including pharmacology, PK, toxicokinetic and metabolism studies, that support subsequent clinical testing in humans. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.


Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new biopharmaceutical product to humans.
 The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises any concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial(s) and places the trial(s) on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, the clinical data are relevant to the US patient population in terms of medical practice, standard of care, and patient population definition, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 ▪Phase 1. For biologics being studied in oncology indications, the investigational product is initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are generally designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 ▪Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and additional information on PK and PD. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 ▪Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, purity and potency for an intended use, and generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.


BLA Submission and Review
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its biopharmaceutical substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.


A product intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval preapproval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat patients with a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.


In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease, and not to all uses or indications within the entire disease or condition. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration, biopharmaceutical product listing, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplement submission, which may require the development of additional preclinical studies, clinical trials, data and/or assays, such as comparability protocols.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 ▪Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls.
 ▪Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials.
 ▪Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals.
 ▪Product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products.
 ▪Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
 ▪Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
 ▪The issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product.
 ▪Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.


Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA approved reference biological product.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Additionally, prescribing physicians are free to specify “Do Not Substitute” in prescriptions, which would prohibit pharmacists from substituting a branded biologic product for a biosimilar product.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and impact of the BPCIA are subject to uncertainty.
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize any of our product candidates, including countries in Europe and Asia. Such foreign regulations govern, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of a clinical trial or marketing of a product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar approval process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.


European Union Drug Development
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the E.U. Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the E.U. clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the E.U. Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the E.U. countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 aims at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency.
 In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of Marketing Authorizations:
 ▪The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for products that are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
 ▪National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.


Other U.S Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Biopharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Research, manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
 ▪The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act, or FCA. In addition, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to eliminate the need to prove specific intent and actual knowledge to establish an Anti-Kickback Statute violation.
 ▪The federal civil and criminal false claims, including the FCA that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
 ▪The civil monetary penalties laws impose penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
 ▪The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 ▪Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 ▪The FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices.
 ▪The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value made in the previous year to covered recipients, including physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 ▪The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, price reporting, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. For example, products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.


▪The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 ▪Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, anti-referral and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to comply with the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report certain information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities, such as stock-option compensation paid to physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The growth of our business and sales organization and our expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payors may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are often used as models by private payors and other governmental payors to develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products to obtain third-party payor coverage, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.


Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, a new licensure framework for follow on biologic products, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. However, on April 27, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a Federal Circuit decision that previously upheld Congress’ denial of $12 billion in “risk corridor” funding. There have been legislative and judicial efforts to repeal, replace, or change some or all of the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration. In June 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments can vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.


Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require a pharmaceutical manufacturer to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These and other new laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our biopharmaceutical products, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
 Additionally, the Right to Try Act, which was enacted on May 30, 2018, provides a federal framework for certain patients with life-threatening diseases to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
