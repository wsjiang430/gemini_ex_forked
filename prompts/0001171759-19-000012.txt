ITEM 1.    Business
Overview
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, primarily develops, operates, and franchises full-service restaurants in North America and focuses on serving an imaginative selection of high quality gourmet burgers in a fun environment welcoming to Guests of all ages. We opened the first Red Robin® restaurant in Seattle, Washington in September 1969. In 1979, the first franchised Red Robin restaurant was opened in Yakima, Washington. In 2001, we formed Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and consummated a reorganization of the Company. Since that time, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. has owned, either directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding capital stock or membership interests, respectively, of Red Robin International, Inc. and our other operating subsidiaries through which we operate our Company-owned restaurants. Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “Red Robin,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refer to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. As of the end of our fiscal year on December 30, 2018, there were 573 Red Robin restaurants, of which 484 were Company-owned and 89 were operated by franchisees. Our franchisees are independent organizations to whom we provide certain support. See “Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements” for additional information about our franchise program. As of December 30, 2018, there were Red Robin restaurants in 44 states and two Canadian provinces.
Financial information for our single operating segment is included in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the last Sunday of the calendar year. Fiscal year 2018 included 52 weeks, ending on December 30, 2018.

Fiscal year 2019 will include 52 weeks, ending on December 29, 2019. We refer to our fiscal years as 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014 throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Strategy
Red Robin’s goal is to differentiate itself from casual dining establishments based on attributes our most loyal Guests give us credit for: Quality, Service, and Value. To differentiate on Quality, we offer a large and varied selection of craveable and highly customizable burgers. To differentiate on Service, our goal is to serve food and beverages quickly and attentively so Guests can spend more time enjoying their food and less time waiting. We also strive to deliver competitive Value by providing abundant portions at a range of price points. Red Robin Team Members seek to live our B.U.R.G.E.R. values everyday: Bottomless Fun, Unwavering Integrity, Relentless Focus on Improvement, Genuine Spirit of Service, Extraordinary People, and Recognized Burger Authority.
In addition to caring for those Guests who choose to dine in at Red Robin, we are also expanding our reach to those Guests who choose to carry-out a meal, use a third-party delivery service, or cater a meeting or event. These platforms are rapidly growing and it is our goal to move Red Robin from being a destination for dining-in to a destination and a source for dining wherever the Guests want to go.
To ensure the success of Red Robin in a rapidly evolving marketplace, we are focused on quickly turning business performance around by urgently executing the business fundamentals that include building profitable sales and delivering a consistent, high quality guest experience through exceptional operations. Our long-term strategy includes four strategic pillars:

• | Attract, Retain, and Engage High Performance Teams. We emphasize and support Team Member engagement, retention, and culture that will foster the development of great leaders. Our goal is to enhance clarity with our Team Members by consistently communicating our strategy through a common playbook and ensuring we remain narrowly focused on our key initiatives. We continually strive to develop extraordinary people and encourage Team Member performance through appreciation, recognition, and respect. In an effort to continue to develop leadership strength, we are focused on executing dynamic succession planning, and innovative recruiting and talent development. See “Learning and Development” below for additional information about our Team Member development initiatives.


• | Evolve to Better Serve Middle Income Families. We actively seek to enhance Value through a balance of quality, quantity, price, and experience. This includes providing high quality menu items, offering new products at everyday value prices and delivering on abundance through a wide choice of bottomless sides and beverages. We frequently enhance our Red Robin Royalty™ program to drive guest traffic through frequent buyer rewards. Additionally, we are 

2

focused on driving guest preference at any occasion by offering our products through alternate modes of access. As part of this strategy, we offer online ordering for carry-out, delivery access in the majority of our locations via multiple third party services, and catering. We are also currently testing self-delivery for potential deployment in future years.

• | Embrace the "Gift of Time" as a Key Differentiator. Our strategy in regaining our operational edge includes serving consistently great burgers, accurately customized, and served quickly by our caring Team Members whether the Guest chooses to dine in the restaurant or off premise. We respect our Guests’ need for the “gift of time” in an increasingly time-starved culture and remain committed to improving both speed of service and order accuracy. 


• | Improve Company and 4-Wall Economics. We are committed to delivering stockholder value by improving profitability and investing capital wisely. Our goal is to optimize our capital structure, prudently invest in technology and restaurant development that deliver targeted returns on investment, refranchise certain restaurants, and improve our EBITDA margin through sustainable revenue growth and prudent cost management at the restaurant level and above. 

Restaurant Concept
The Red Robin brand has many desirable attributes, including a range of high-quality menu items, a strong guest-focused culture, and a value proposition designed to help our Guests customize their experiences.
We pride ourselves on being THE Burger Authority. Our menu features our signature product, a line of Gourmet Burgers which we make from premium quality, fresh ground beef. To complement our best-selling Gourmet Burgers we offer an everyday-value line of Red’s Tavern Double® burgers, and Red Robin’s Finest line made with premium toppings. We also offer burgers made with chicken breasts (grilled or fried), hand breaded cod and grilled salmon fillets, and turkey patties, as well as a proprietary vegetarian patty. We offer a wide selection of buns, including ciabatta, gluten free, sesame, onion, whole grain, jalapeno, and lettuce wraps, with a variety of toppings, including fresh guacamole, house-made barbeque sauces, grilled pineapple, crispy onion straws, sautéed mushrooms, fried jalapenos, bruschetta salsa, coleslaw, eight different cheese choices, and a fried egg. All of our burgers are served with our all-you-can-eat Bottomless Steak Fries® or a Guest may choose from five other bottomless sides. We specialize in customizing our menu items to meet our Guests’ dietary needs and preferences and have received recognition from experts in the allergy community. In addition to burgers, which accounted for 54% of our total food and beverage sales in 2018, Red Robin serves an array of other items that appeal to a broad range of Guests. These items include a variety of appetizers, salads, soups, seafood, and other entrees. We also offer a range of single-serving and shareable desserts as well as our classic and Finest milkshakes. Our beverages include signature alcoholic and non-alcoholic specialty drinks, cocktails, wine, and a variety of national and craft beers.
We strive to meet the needs of our Guests by offering a choice of experiences and occasions from time-pressured meals to a place to relax and unwind with friends. Red Robin also has an unparalleled and extraordinary approach to guest service and we have cataloged thousands of stories of Red Robin Team Members who live our values. Many examples can be found on our website, www.redrobin.com. We encourage our Team Members to execute on the aspects of service that we have identified to be the biggest drivers of our guest loyalty. Note that our website and the information contained on or connected to our website are not incorporated by reference herein, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.
We also strive to provide our Guests with exceptional dining value and the ability to customize their experience. In 2018, we had an average check per Guest of $12.92 including beverages. We believe this price-to-value relationship, our innovative array of burgers starting at $6.99 and ranging up to $15.49, differentiates us from our casual dining competitors and allows us to appeal to a broad base of middle income, multi-generational consumers.
Operations
Restaurant Management
Our typical restaurant management team consists of a general manager, an assistant general manager, and two or three assistant managers depending on restaurant sales volumes. The management team of each restaurant is responsible for the day-to-day operation of that restaurant, including hiring, training, and coaching of Team Members, as well as operating results. Our typical restaurant employs approximately 58 hourly Team Members, most of whom work part-time.
3

Learning and Development
We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the training and supervision of Team Members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to Team Member performance, food and beverage preparation, and the maintenance of our restaurants. Each restaurant maintains a group of certified learning coaches who are tasked with preparing new Team Members for success by providing on-the-job training leading up to a final skills certification for their position. Team Members seeking advancement have the opportunity to join our management development program as a Shift Supervisor.
Shift Supervisors complete an in-depth training curriculum that develops their ability to supervise all aspects of shift execution, including, but not limited to, food safety, food production, coaching, and financial aspects of the business. The Shift Supervisor program is an important stepping stone for hourly Team Members who desire a career in restaurant management.
New restaurant managers participate in our eight-week Management Foundations training program. This program hones each manager’s skills, specifically in two areas: flawless shift execution and effective coaching of Team Members.
Providing our restaurant teams the support and resources they need to be successful requires dedication, an of-service attitude, and the utmost professionalism on the part of our home office team. We ensure the home office Team Members have what they need to meet these demands by offering several avenues to enhance their professional development, including but not limited to an in-house leadership library of over 400 titles, more than 40 on-site and 12 off-site development workshop opportunities, as well as one-on-one coaching.
Food Safety and Purchasing
Our food safety and quality assurance programs help manage our commitment to quality ingredients and food preparation. Our systems are designed to protect our food supply from product receipt through preparation and service. We provide detailed specifications for our food ingredients, products, and supplies to our suppliers. We qualify and audit our key manufacturers and growers and require their certification under the Global Food Safety Initiative. Our restaurant managers are certified in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course by the National Restaurant Association’s ServSafe program. Minimum cooking requirements, specifically safe handling, cooling procedures, and frequent temperature and quality checks, exist for the safety and quality of all food we serve in our restaurants. In order to provide the freshest ingredients and products and to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, each restaurant’s management team determines the restaurant’s daily usage requirements for food ingredients, products, and supplies, and accordingly, orders from approved suppliers, and distributors. The restaurant management team inspects deliveries to ensure the products received meet our safety and quality specifications. Additionally, we utilize the services of an independent auditing company to perform unannounced comprehensive food safety and sanitation inspections up to four times a year in all Company-owned and franchised restaurants.
To maximize our purchasing efficiencies and obtain the best possible prices for our high-quality ingredients, products, and supplies, our centralized purchasing team negotiates supply agreements which may include fixed price contracts that vary in term lengths or formula-based pricing agreements which can fluctuate on changes in raw material commodity pricing. Of our total cost of goods in 2018, potatoes represented approximately 14%, ground beef represented approximately 13%, and poultry represented approximately 10%. We monitor the primary commodities we purchase and extend contract positions when applicable in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability. However, certain commodities, primarily cheese, potatoes, and ground beef remain subject to market price fluctuations. We continue to identify competitively priced, high quality alternative manufacturers, suppliers, growers, and distributors that are available should the need arise; however, we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain. As of December 30, 2018, approximately 62.3% of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are scheduled to expire at various times through the end of 2019.
Restaurant Development
Red Robin has grown its restaurant base prudently considering a number of factors, including general economic conditions, expected financial performance, availability of appropriate locations, competition in local markets, and the availability of teams to manage new locations. Our site selection criteria focuses on identifying markets, trade areas, and specific sites that are likely to yield the greatest density of desirable demographic characteristics, retail traffic, and visibility. During 2018, we opened eight Company-owned restaurants. Over the past three years, we have opened a total of 52 new restaurants, acquired 13 franchised restaurants, and relocated four restaurants.
4

During 2019, we will continue to execute our long term growth strategy which includes pausing on new corporate growth as we will carefully address our changing guest base, opportunities to broaden our reach, and execute sustainable growth initiatives that deliver value to our stockholders.
Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements
As of December 30, 2018, our franchisees operated 89 restaurants in 16 states. Our two largest franchisees own 43 restaurants located in Michigan, Ohio, and eastern and central Pennsylvania. In 2018, certain franchisees opened three new restaurants based on new area development agreements executed in 2017. We expect our franchisees will open new units in 2019 and anticipate franchise unit growth to continue as our franchisees complete required investments to bring existing restaurants to our current brand and design standards. We are identifying additional franchise opportunities to grow our franchise base through existing and new franchisees based on markets of interest.
Franchise Compliance Assurance
We actively work with and monitor our franchisees’ performance to help them develop and operate their restaurants in compliance with Red Robin’s standards, systems, and procedures. During the restaurant development phase, we review the franchisee’s site selection and provide the franchisee with our prototype building plans. We provide trainers to assist the franchisee in opening the restaurant for business. We advise the franchisee on all menu items, management training, and equipment and food purchases.
To continuously improve our marketing programs and operating systems, we maintain a franchise advisory board consisting of franchisee members that meet with the corporate executive team. Through this advisory board, we solicit the input of our franchisees on marketing programs, including their suggestions as to which new menu items we should test and feature in future promotions. We also exchange best operating practices with our franchisees as we strive to improve our operating systems while attaining a high level of franchisee participation.
Information Technology
We rely on information systems in all aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, point-of-sale transaction processing in our restaurants; operation of our restaurants; management of our inventories; collection of cash; payment of payroll and other obligations; and various other processes and procedures.
Our corporate offices and Company-owned restaurants are enabled with information technology and decision support systems. In our restaurants, these systems are designed to provide operational tools for sales, inventory, and labor management. This technology includes industry-specific, off-the-shelf systems, as well as proprietary software such as tools designed to optimize food and beverage costs and labor costs. These systems are integrated with our point-of-sale systems to provide daily, weekly, and period-to-date information that is important for managers to run an efficient and effective restaurant. We also use other systems to interact with our Guests. These include online and in-restaurant guest feedback systems, which provide real-time results on guest service, food quality, and atmosphere to each of our restaurants.
We utilize centralized financial, accounting, and human resources/personnel systems for Company-owned restaurants. In addition, we use an operations scorecard which integrates data from our centralized systems and distributes information to assist in managing our restaurants. We believe these combined tools are important in analyzing and improving our operations, profit margins, and other results.
In 2018, we invested in technologies and data infrastructure that modernized and upgraded the capacity of our restaurant systems, upgraded our point-of-sale and inventory management systems, and improved flexibility of business operations. We also began work to provide our Guests with improved digital experiences that support in-restaurant and off-premise dining. In 2019 we plan to continue our investments in building innovative digital experiences for our Guests and to improve our ability to manage our technology infrastructure through investments in connectivity, automation, and advanced monitoring.
We accept electronic payment cards from our Guests for payment in our restaurants. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our Guests and Team Members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our Guests’ credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our Team Members’ personal information. We have taken a number of steps to prevent the occurrence of security breaches in this respect. Our systems have been carefully designed and configured to protect against data loss or compromise. For example, because of the number of credit card transactions processed in our Company-owned stores, we are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard compliance at our corporate offices and Company-owned restaurants. 
5

These standards, set by a consortium of the major credit card companies, require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers’ credit card and other personal information.
We also engage security assessors and consultants to review and advise us on our other data security practices with respect to protection of other sensitive personal information that we obtain from Guests and Team Members.
Marketing and Advertising
We build brand equity and awareness primarily through national marketing, including national television, digital media, social media programs, email, loyalty, and public relations initiatives. These programs are funded primarily through cooperative creative development and national media advertising funds.
In recent years, we have undertaken significant market research initiatives to gain feedback and perceptions in order to inform our business decisions. Among other things, we use a guest satisfaction tool in all restaurants that provides feedback from Guests on their experiences. Restaurant managers use this information to help identify areas of focus to strengthen restaurant performance and track progress. We also continually monitor our performance relative to peers and test potential business drivers among both current and potential Guests. We closely track the frequency and purchase behavior of Guests who are members of our Red Robin RoyaltyTM loyalty program.
In 2016, our marketing strategy began to shift toward a concentrated, rather than continuous, media buying approach with a focus on generating significant reach and frequency during on-air advertising periods. We plan to continue with this concentrated marketing approach in 2019, while communicating a clear message focused on craveable burgers, affordable abundance, and attentive service across a variety of advertising media. We will also deploy marketing support for our alternative platforms initiative, including generating Guest awareness of our online ordering, to-go, and catering dining opportunities.
Team Members
As of December 30, 2018, we had 27,283 employees, whom we refer to as Team Members, consisting of 26,935 Team Members at Company-owned restaurants and 348 Team Members at our corporate headquarters and field offices. None of our Team Members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our Team Member relations to be good.
We support our Team Members by offering competitive wages and benefits for eligible Team Members, including medical and other insurance, an employee stock purchase plan, and equity-based awards for eligible corporate and operations employees at the director level and above. We motivate and develop our Team Members by providing them with opportunities for increased responsibilities and advancement. At certain levels, we also offer performance-based incentives tied to sales, profitability, and/or certain qualitative measures.

Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive and our Guests may choose to purchase food at supermarkets or other food retailers. Although, for some occasions, we compete against other segments of the restaurant industry, including quick-service and fast-casual restaurants, our primary competition is with other sit-down, casual dining restaurants within the casual dining segment. In addition, we compete to attract Guests for off-premise dining occasions, including online ordering, delivery, to-go, and catering. The number, size, and strength of competitors vary by region, concept, market, and even restaurant. We compete on the basis of taste, quality, price of food and related guest value, guest service, ambiance, location, and overall dining experience. 
7

We believe our guest demographics, strong brand recognition, gourmet burger concept, family-friendly atmosphere, attractive price-value relationship, and the quality of our food and service enable us to differentiate ourselves from our full service competitors. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Our competitors include well-established national chains which have more substantial marketing resources. We also compete with many other restaurant and retail establishments for team members.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season due to factors including our retail-oriented locations and family appeal. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease.
Trademarks
We have a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including the Red Robin®, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers®, Red Robin America’s Gourmet Burgers & Spirits®, Red Robin Burger Works®, “YUMMM®”, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and BrewsTM, and Red Robin RoyaltyTM names and logos. We have registered or filed applications for trademarks for these marks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and we have applied to register various trademarks in certain other international jurisdictions.
In order to better protect our brand, we have also registered the Internet domain name www.redrobin.com. We believe our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to our brand building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concept.
Government Regulation
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by state, province, and local health, safety, fire, and other authorities, including licensing requirements, and regulations for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. To date, we have been able to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals. The development and construction of new restaurants is subject also to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. We are also subject to federal regulation and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our Team Members and affect operating costs. These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, health care and benefits, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations, and discriminatory conduct. Federal, state and local government agencies have established or are in the process of establishing regulations requiring that we disclose to our Guests nutritional information regarding the items we serve.
