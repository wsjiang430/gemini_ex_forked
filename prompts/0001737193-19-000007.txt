ITEM 1. 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Baja Custom Design, Inc. (the “Company”) has recently launched its business of sourcing and buying readymade and custom furniture and decorator items in Mexico for resale in the United States. The Company hopes to source products from small, artisanal manufacturers in Tijuana and Rosarito Beach in Baja California, Mexico. It hopes to sell to decorators, interior designers, contractors and end users in the San Diego area. The Company offers traditional Mexican rustic furniture and solid wood doors as well as finely crafted custom pieces in hardwood and pine. In addition to wood furniture we also offer custom made decorator items such as earthenware and ceramic vases, pots and tiles and wrought iron pieces. The Company launched its business in late 2017. Although we have begun business operations, as of the date of this filing the Company can still be defined as a "shell" company because it is an entity which has only nominal operations and nominal assets.
 
Many interior designers, decorators and building contractors seek custom made items for clients. While there is no shortage of cabinet makers, metal workers, and stone and tile workers in Southern California capable of supplying these needs, the cost of specially made goods in the U.S. can be quite high compared to specially made goods in Mexico. Labor costs, which are a significant portion of the cost of custom made goods, are much lower in Mexico than they are in the U.S. This labor cost differential causes many large U.S. corporations to open factories in, or buy products from, Mexico. But small businesses and individual professionals such as small building contractors or interior designers often lack the language skills and knowledge of Mexico to efficiently source craftsmen and craft products there. Our Company provides the language skills, knowledge of Mexico, and knowledge of Mexican artisans that allows Southern California design professionals to buy in Baja California, Mexico. 
 
We act as direct contractors with designers and building contractors who wish to purchase custom designed items. We then sub-contract fabrication to workshops in Mexico. When completed (and in certain cases during fabrication) we inspect the product for quality. Upon quality approval we take delivery in Mexico, work with customs and pay necessary duties, and deliver the product to the customer in the U.S.
 
Our Advantages:


Low Cost of Labor: Our primary advantage is the relatively low cost of our products. Many designers, decorators and building contractors seek custom made items for clients. While these needs are now being met by buying from custom craftsmen in Southern California, the cost of specially made goods made here is significantly higher than in Mexico. The low cost of skilled labor in Mexico allows us to supply hand crafted wood furniture, wrought iron, and other products at a fraction of their cost in the U.S.
High Quality Suppliers: Our other advantage is our knowledge of high quality suppliers in Mexico. While Tijuana is only 20 miles from the city center of San Diego, problems with language, business customs, and other concerns mean that most American designers are unwilling to source products in Mexico. Our officers have worked with suppliers in the Tijuana area for more than ten years. Our president has worked in the design and decorating field for more than 40 years, and has worked with suppliers in Tijuana and Rosarito Beach, sourcing furniture and other hand crafted designer items for clients for more than ten years. Our vice president is a real estate professional licensed in Massachusetts and California and a member of AMPI (Asociacion Mexicana de Profesionales Inmobiliarios) the Mexican association for real estate sales persons. Over the past three years she has assisted many Americans with buying and furnishing vacation homes in Mexico, working with local craftsmen in Baja California to supply them with furniture and specialty items. 
Competition:
 
We compete with a variety of companies and individuals in sourcing hand crafted products in Mexico. Most of these find and import ready made products such as handmade pottery and tiles, but some, like our Company, contract to have goods custom made. Arranging the manufacture of custom made, hand crafted goods is, by its nature, a one-at-a-time business and not well suited to large, multinational corporations. Therefore we expect our competition to be other small businesses. 
 
We believe that we will be able to compete successfully with other small businesses because of our knowledge and experience with artisans in Mexico and our knowledge and experience of the needs of designers and decorators in the United States. However, we completed only one sale in the year ended December 31, 2018, and we must therefore acknowledge a strong possibility that we will be unable to successfully develop our business plan. In that event we will seek to enter a merger or acquisition agreement with another business which seeks the benefits of our shareholder base and/or our status as a repoting issuer.
