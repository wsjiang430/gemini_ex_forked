ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General
 Amarillo Biosciences, Inc. (the "Company” or “ABI”) is a Texas corporation formed in 1984 engaged in developing biologics for the treatment of human and animal diseases. Our current focus is research aimed at the treatment of human disease indications, particularly influenza, hepatitis C, thrombocytopenia, and other indications using natural human interferon alpha that is administered in a proprietary low dose oral form.
 
ABI currently owns or licenses six issued patents, five in the U.S., and one in Taiwan, of which five patents are related to the low-dose oral delivery of interferon and one patent is associated with a dietary supplement, Maxisal®.  In our history, we have completed more than 100 pre-clinical (animal) and human studies on the safety and efficacy of low-dose orally administered interferon, including two phase 3 clinical trials. On October 31, 2013, ABI filed a voluntary petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, for protection under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. code.  The Company successfully reorganized both organizationally and financially and exited bankruptcy in January of 2015.

In addition to the core technology discussed in the first paragraph of this section, ABI is currently working to expand the Company’s current focus into a diversified healthcare business portfolio in order to generate new revenue streams.
 
Current Status
 The Company completely reorganized and has been restructured into three business units: the Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Consumer Product Divisions. Historically, the Company has focused on R&D involving low-dose, orally administered lozenges containing the natural immune system activator interferon-alpha as a treatment for a variety of conditions. Under the leadership of Dr. Stephen T. Chen, ABI began its new life with a valuable intellectual property portfolio including issued patents and a trademark.  Additionally, ABI has a library of almost thirty years of scientific and clinical data on the human and animal applications of low-dose oral interferon. Through the Pharmaceutical Division, ABI seeks to out-license or leverage in other ways its core technology by forming partnerships to develop current and new discoveries and commercialize the resulting products.

An integral part of the ABI Operating Plan is to create multiple revenue streams through the implementation of programs (including but not limited to in-licensing) of medical and healthcare products and processes. The Medical Division and Consumer Products Division will facilitate the enhancement of those revenue streams. These programs will be the catalyst which allows ABI to enter markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and other Asian countries for the distribution of these new medical and healthcare products.
 Diabetes is a global epidemic with an estimated cost topping $2.5 trillion world-wide.  Taiwan, gateway to China and representative of the upward trend in diabetes prevalence and cost throughout Asia, saw a 70% increase in total diabetes cases between 2000-2009 with a 35% increase in standardized prevalence rate.  Currently, almost 2 million people suffer from diabetes in Taiwan, which equals 11% prevalence or 1 in 9 people, for a country with a population of around 18 million adults. The adoption of a Western diet and lifestyle has had more detrimental effects on East Asian countries with diabetes prevalence in Taiwan and China now outpacing the US and other Western nations.  Studies have shown that East Asians have weaker insulin secretions compared with other ethnicities which make controlling blood glucose more challenging which in turn makes them more susceptible to type 2 diabetes. The weaker insulin response seen in Taiwanese and Chinese populations could be due to certain genetic polymorphisms or differential intestinal secretions and helps explain why only 30-40% of East Asians with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese compared to over 80% of Americans. So while obesity is on the rise in China, diabetes is climbing at a faster rate than other obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and cancer. Diabetic complications such as retinopathy which is a leading cause of blindness, peripheral neuropathies which contribute to delayed wound healing and amputations, and nephropathy which can necessitate dialysis and kidney transplant, are catastrophic both to quality of life and cost of care.
 Currently, type 2 diabetes is treated as a chronic progressive disease with increases in both number and dose of drugs seen across a patient’s lifetime. Generally one or more oral hypoglycemic drugs are used for months or years until a combination of short and long-acting insulin is required to keep the patient’s blood glucose within normal limits. Unfortunately, once a patient’s pancreas is exhausted and they are finally forced to go on insulin, they require insulin for the rest of their lives. And even more unfortunate is that even with fairly well-controlled blood glucose levels, diabetics will face one or more undesirable complications with poor outcomes from cardiovascular, eye, nerve, or kidney disease secondary to their diabetes. This unsuccessful model of diabetes care is not satisfactory.
 Amarillo Biosciences, Inc. has been developing pulsatile insulin therapy in Taiwan that consists of delivering insulin intravenously by pump in pulses, as opposed to the typical subcutaneous route of administration, in order to more closely imitate how the pancreas secretes insulin in healthy non-diabetics.
 When the liver receives insulin in discreet pulses, it appears to better able to regulate blood glucose levels. Patients suffering from peripheral neuropathies have reported less numbness and pain after receiving pulsatile insulin infusion treatments for several weeks or months. Pulsatile-insulin treatments given once or twice a week for a number of months show promise in lessening the incidence and severity of microvascular complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.  ABI’s Medical Division is currently investigating medical equipment options for its pulsatile insulin infusion pump.
 Within the next year, ABI plans to be able to offer innovative and comprehensive diabetes treatment that provide solutions to all stages of diabetes from pre-diabetes through late-stage diabetes with advanced complications targeting Taiwan first, with plans to open clinics in China within 3 years. Within the Medical division, ABI is also a licensed distributor of TissueAid™ biodegradable wound closure products in Taiwan.  ABI became the official distributor of TissueAid™ for the Taiwan market in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The TissueAid™ product is developed by the first and only medical material research company for wound care, GJ Biotech Co Ltd. This distributorship provides momentum to enter next level for ABI.

The global market of tissue adhesives is $800 million and has an annual growth of 11%. Since the current market in Taiwan has yet to previously use this product, there is great room for growth. The first quarter of 2018 has seen successful distribution within the following medical institution systems:
 1- Tri-Service General Hospital - the product was implemented into the procurement system of the hospital in Feb 2018, and has been used for breast surgery for plastic surgery. TissueAid™ will be utilized by additional departments of the hospital in the near future.
 2- In collaboration with MYTREX HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES - as of Feb 2018 the procurement system of Min Sheng Hospital had finished coding the product and the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology was ready to begin applying it in Laparoscopy surgery and C-sections.
 The Consumer Product Division is presently working on multiple endeavors. First, this ABI division now offers a unique proprietary liposomal delivery system for nutraceuticals and food supplements including Vitamin C, Glutathione, CoQ10, Curcumin/Resveratrol, DHA, and a Multi-Vitamin. The Company also has a dietary supplement product, Maxisal® that is useful in the symptomatic relief of dry mouth.
 In 2018 ABI established a representative branch office in Taiwan – Amarillo Biosciences, Inc. (Taiwan Branch) (美商康華全球生技股份有限公司 台灣分公司) (“ABI Taiwan”) to increase the Company's presence in Taiwan and serve as an operational hub to access growing Asian markets.
 
Core Technology 
 
Injectable interferon is FDA-approved to treat some neoplastic, viral and autoimmune diseases.  Many patients experience moderate to severe side-effects, causing them to discontinue injectable interferon therapy.  Our core technology is a natural human interferon-alpha that is delivered into the oral cavity as a lozenge in low (nanogram) doses. The lozenge dissolves in the mouth where interferon binds to surface (mucosal) cells in the mouth and throat, resulting in activation of hundreds of genes in the peripheral blood that stimulate the immune system.  Human studies have shown that oral interferon is safe and effective against viral and neoplastic diseases. Oral interferon is given in concentrations 10,000 times less than that usually given by injection. The Company’s low-dose formulation results in almost no side effects, in contrast to high dose injectable interferon, which causes adverse effects in at least 50% of recipients.
 
Governmental or FDA approval is required for low-dose oral interferon.  Our progress toward approval is discussed under each specific indication, below.  We believe that our technology is sound and can be commercialized.  Due to occurrences in the interferon market over the past several years, we have been unsuccessful at such commercialization.
 
Interferon Supply
 
The Company’s long-time human interferon producer is no longer manufacturing interferon.  Plans for further clinical trials and commercialization of a low-dose interferon product have been placed on hold until a new cGMP source of interferon is found.  ABI is actively seeking a new manufacturing partner and exploring options with pharmaceutical companies that have a supply of natural human interferon made in a similar manner, but from a different cell line as our previous product.
 
Procuring a new source of interferon will require some studies demonstrating comparability and further clinical trials will have to be performed.  Although these studies may prove costly and time consuming, the Company will be able to use optimized protocols from its thirty years of experience in conducting trials with natural human interferon.  Rather than having to start from greenfield stage, the Company will be able to leverage its history, past results, and data library to target the most appropriate disease states with the best dosage regimens and minimize the time wasted by trial-and-error searching prevalent in pharmaceutical research.

While the pharmaceutical industry is creating and marketing new and effective anti-viral medications, ABI believes that there is still sufficient time to develop and commercialize low-dose interferon as a safer anti-viral treatment for Influenza, Hepatitis, and other conditions caused by viruses such as genital warts and canker sores. Interferon also has powerful cytotoxic effects which in combination with its immune stimulating activities could play a role in the rapidly expanding field of cancer immunotherapy.  Other demonstrated effects of interferon offer opportunities to commercialize low-dose interferon for the treatment of Thrombocytopenia and chronic cough in lung diseases such as COPD and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).  The Company has the opportunity to capitalize on its relationship channels in the Asian markets to explore sources of raw materials, capital, production facilities, and to target a significant and growing sales market.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Since inception, the Company has worked to build an extensive patent portfolio for low-dose orally administered interferon. This portfolio consists of patents with claims that encompass method of use or treatment, and/or composition of matter and manufacturing. As listed below, the Company presently owns or licenses six issued patents.
ACTIVE PATENTS:

Cost of Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 The Company incurred no costs to comply with environment regulations in 2018.
 
Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is an expanding and rapidly changing industry characterized by intense competition. ABI believes that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our ability to successfully operate the newly reorganized business, bring in new business lines, continue recapitalization, redevelop and test our products and continually enhance and improve our products and leverage our core technologies. In order to do so, we must effectively utilize and expand our research and development capabilities and, once developed, expeditiously convert new technology into products and processes, which can be commercialized. Competition is based primarily on scientific and technological superiority, technical support, availability of patent protection, access to adequate capital, the ability to develop, acquire and market products and processes successfully, the ability to obtain governmental approvals and the ability to serve the particular needs of commercial customers.  Corporations and institutions with greater resources therefore, have a significant competitive advantage.
  5
 

Our potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents and/or medical devices for treatment of human and animal disease. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Competitors may succeed in developing products or processes that are more effective or less costly than any that may be developed by us or that gain regulatory approval prior to our products.  ABI expects that the number of competitors and potential competitors will increase as more anti-viral and cytotoxic products receive commercial marketing approvals from the FDA or analogous foreign regulatory agencies. Any of these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing, marketing and distributing its products.  However, upon securing a new source of interferon, ABI’s intellectual property and clinical trials experience with low-dose oral human interferon-alpha, its efficacy for a broad array of disease states, and its strong safety record, will continue to give the Company a foot-hold in the anti-viral and cytotoxic therapeutics markets.
 
United States Regulation
 Before products with health claims can be marketed in the United States, they must receive approval from the FDA. To receive this approval, any drug must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials that demonstrate the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory process controls, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.
 
In general, before any ethical pharmaceutical product can be marketed in the United States, the FDA will require the following process:
 

• | Preclinical laboratory and animal tests; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
• | Pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators; 
• | Submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA; and 
• | FDA approval of an NDA, or of an NDA supplement (for subsequent indications or other modifications, including a change in location of the manufacturing facility). 

 
Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials, and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies. At such time as ABI undertakes to commercialize any of its products, all necessary preclinical testing, clinical trials, data review, and approval steps will be judiciously executed to insure that the product satisfies all regulatory requirements at all levels.
 
505(b)(2)
 ABI has historically followed and will continue to follow the traditional approval process for New Drugs as set out in Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If an alternative path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products is scientifically and economically feasible and beneficial to the Company and the public, ABI may choose to follow this alternative path as established by section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This
  6
 

section of the Act permits the applicant to rely on certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for and approved product as some of the information required for approval and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The process of approval under 505(b)(2) will be followed as judiciously as 505(b)(1) or any regulation.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. ABI may choose to seek approval for a product satisfying the definition of and Orphan Drug if that product can be used to treat such an indication.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration or rigidity of the regulatory review and approval process.
Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of products in foreign countries. Whether or not the Company obtains FDA approval for a product, the Company must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before the Company can commence clinical trials or market the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of investigational drugs or approval of new diseases for existing products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. It is not possible to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
Research and Development
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $32,591 in expenses towards research activities associated with the development of a proprietary pulsatile insulin treatment. ABI has been proactively seeking a replacement source of interferon and anticipates several opportunities to explore in the near future.  If a satisfactory replacement source of interferon is identified and will serve the goals of the Company, adequate funds to procure such source will be allocated to conduct research activities to revitalize the Company’s core technology.
Employees
 The Company currently has four full-time employees and two part-time employees. Of these six employees, two are executive officers and four work in legal, administrative, business development and research and development capacities; although no costs of these employees are currently allocated to research and development. Non-employee Consultants in business and research development are also engaged as needed.
