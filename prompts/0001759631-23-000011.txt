ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Hyliion is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Cedar Park, Texas, and became a NYSE listed company as a result of the merger consummated pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, dated June 18, 2020, between Tortoise Acquisition Corp. and each of the shareholders of Hyliion Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Business Combination”).
Our mission is to be the leading provider of electrified solutions for the commercial vehicle industry as well as other industries. Our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in the transportation sector by providing electrified solutions for Class 8 vehicles that both aim to reduce the cost of operation and promote the usage of existing fueling infrastructure. Our current products and products under development utilize control software, data analytics, battery systems, fully integrated electric motors, and power electronics to produce our electrified powertrain systems.
We currently offer the Hyliion Hybrid (“Hybrid”) system, which is an electrified powertrain system that augments existing Class 8 semi-trucks and aims to improve vehicle performance or reduce fuel usage, depending on application. The Hybrid system can either be installed on a new vehicle prior to entering service or retrofit onto an existing in-service vehicle. This feature gives our customers the flexibility to continue using their preferred vehicle brands and maintain their existing fleet maintenance and operations strategies.
We began selling the Hybrid system in late 2021 and it has been installed on a variety of our customers’ commercial vehicles, utilizing multiple original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) platforms. Our Hybrid system deployments are with innovative fleets in the transportation and logistics sector and include a variety of duty cycles, use cases and geographical regions. A common application is to install the Hybrid system on a compressed natural gas (“CNG”)-powered truck with a conventional drivetrain. The Hybrid system aims to improve performance by giving a power boost to the CNG drivetrain when needed, along with regenerative braking and an optional fully electric auxiliary power system. Across these customer installations, and over the entire Hyliion fleet, we have accumulated millions of real-world road miles on Class 8 semi-trucks.
We also plan to offer the Hypertruck ERX powertrain platform (“Hypertruck ERX system”), which is a complete electrified powertrain system leveraging an onboard CNG-fueled generator to supplement battery range to transform an OEM platform into a range-extended electric vehicle (“REEV”). Both solutions aim to support our customers’ pursuit of sustainability and financial goals by reducing GHG emissions and operating costs while utilizing existing fueling infrastructure. We plan to begin commercialization of the Hypertruck ERX system in late 2023 and our first application will be deployed on a Class 8 Peterbilt 579 sleeper semi-truck.
The Hypertruck ERX system leverages the experience and operating data from our Hybrid system to offer a solution to replace the traditional diesel or CNG powertrain installed in new vehicles. Its onboard CNG generator functions as an electric range-extender, addressing the market need of having a fully electric drive truck that can travel long distance between refuels without relying on a broadly-distributed and reliable electric recharging network, as battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”) do. The systems batteries are recharged by the onboard CNG generator, which when fueled by renewable natural gas (“RNG”), can offer commercial vehicle owners a net-carbon-negative-capable electrified powertrain option.
We believe CNG/RNG is the appropriate fuel source today, as it is cleaner and less expensive than diesel and broadly available. Over time, other fuels are expected to become available in the future to reduce emissions, including hydrogen. Therefore, we have showcased a multistage roadmap that starts with utilizing a CNG/RNG generator and evolves into offering hydrogen-based solutions as well. The control software driving the Hypertruck system is designed to be easily adaptable to different fuel and generator types in accordance with customer and regulatory requirements, thereby reducing future capital investment and time to market.
For long-haul trucking, an electric powertrain with a CNG-fueled range extender generator is preferable today to a pure BEV due to both the comparable cost of fuels and existing availability of CNG fueling infrastructure compared to electric battery charging infrastructure. Class 8 semi-trucks can currently be refueled with CNG through an existing, geographically diverse, public and truck-accessible network of natural gas refueling stations established across North America. Globally, RNG, CNG and liquified natural gas (“LNG”) are also used widely used for land-based transport and trucking. We therefore believe there is a greater opportunity for more rapid adoption of our electrified powertrain solutions across the U.S., Europe, and other countries compared to pure electric solutions, because of the extended range available between refueling events and due to the greater availability of refueling infrastructure compared to other electrified solutions.
In September 2022 we acquired assets including new hydrogen and fuel-agnostic-capable generator technology from General Electric Company's GE Additive business. The KARNO generator emerged out of GE’s long-running R&D investments in metal additive manufacturing across multiple industries and in areas such as generator thermal and performance design. Initial testing indicates the KARNO generator is expected to comply with emissions standards of the California Air Resources Board 
(“CARB”) and the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (“EPA”), even when utilizing conventional fuels. The technology is also expected to achieve a meaningful efficiency improvement over today’s conventional internal combustion engine (“ICE”) generators and could be more efficient than most available fuel cells. We expect these efficiency improvements to in turn enable fuel cost reductions and improved vehicle range while reducing operating costs. The technology should also provide for significant reductions in noise, vibration, moving parts and maintenance compared to conventional ICE generators. The KARNO generator is expected to be capable of operating with over 20 different fuel types including hydrogen, natural gas, propane, ammonia and conventional fossil fuels. The technology uses heat to drive a sealed linear generator to produce electricity. The heat is produced by reacting fuels through flameless oxidation or by other heat sources including renewables.
We plan to initially release the Hypertruck ERX system, followed by a variant utilizing the fuel-agnostic Hyliion KARNO (“KARNO”) generator technology (“Hypertruck KARNO”), and a variant equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell generator (“Hypertruck Fuel Cell”).
Market Opportunity
Our solutions currently address Class 8 vehicles, with an intent to begin deployments in North America, and then potentially expanding to global markets outside of North America. Based on ACT Research’s estimates, the North American Class 8 truck market is expected to average almost 300,000 new units per year between 2023 and 2027. During that time, we expect the regulatory environment to further disincentivize the production and purchase of diesel-powered Class 8 vehicles. Increased costs for diesel-powered Class 8 vehicles along with the fuel to operate them is expected to make electrified alternatives like the Hypertruck ERX system more favorable on a relative total cost of ownership (“TCO”) basis. Similarly, we expect fleets to continue to be influenced by customer and other stakeholder demands to reduce emissions from their transportation operations, thus providing an additional catalyst to transition to low-emission vehicles in the Class 8 space. We view existing plug-in commercial BEVs and commercial fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEVs”) as unlikely to fulfill the fleet demand created by these factors in the near term, due to their range limitations and dependence on costly and scarce fueling infrastructure.
Current and anticipated regulations at the state and federal level are also expected to create greater demand for cleaner commercial vehicles, including zero emission vehicles (“ZEVs”) like BEVs and FCEVs and near-zero emission vehicles (“NZEVs”) like the Hypertruck ERX system. For example, CARB has adopted an Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) rule that requires heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to produce and sell in California a certain number of zero-emission vehicles. In addition to California, a growing number of other states follow CARB's regulatory framework and are also adopting ACT. If heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers do not meet the applicable requirements, they will be deemed unable to sell the rest of their portfolio in that state, creating a significant incentive to deploy ZEV and NZEV vehicles that meet the needs of fleet customers. CARB is also considering a fleet-facing zero-emission vehicle mandate called Advanced Clean Fleet (“ACF”), which acts in a similar manner to ACT by requiring truck operators to add an increasing percentage of ZEV and NZEV vehicles to their fleets over time. The Hypertruck ERX system provides OEMs 75% credit towards satisfaction of the ACT rule compared to a pure BEV or FCEV. It is also expected under a draft of the CARB ACF regulation that the Hypertruck ERX system will receive 100% credit to fleets towards meeting the fleet purchase obligation.
While the Hypertruck ERX system will initially be deployed on the Class 8 Peterbilt 579 sleeper cab, there is an opportunity to develop and deploy additional applications of the Hypertruck ERX system, including on additional Peterbilt variants, with other OEMs that sell comparable models, and in different Class 8 vehicle types, like refuse vehicles. Additional opportunities for the Hypertruck ERX system also exist in applications that require a high-voltage electric power take-off capability, such as electric reefer trailers and special vocational vehicles that are transitioning from hydraulic to high-voltage accessories.
We expect to launch the Hypertruck KARNO powertrain system approximately a few years after the Hypertruck ERX system due to the extensive testing and certification work expected to be required to commercialize a new vehicle generator. The KARNO generator technology is expected to improve the efficiency of the generator system, while further reducing emissions, noise and vibration as well as improve engine maintenance by virtue of having significantly fewer moving parts versus a traditional CNG or diesel ICE as a power source. As hydrogen fuel becomes more widely available and adopted for Class 8 vehicles, the Hypertruck KARNO powertrain, by virtue of its fuel-agnostic KARNO generator design, will be capable of utilizing hydrogen as its fuel source, as well as over twenty other fuel types.
The KARNO generator technology is also expected to be adaptable for stationary power generation applications, such as for electricity generation for onsite electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, select commercial and industrial generation applications, and other market opportunities currently served by the electric grid or other standalone power sources.
Our Technology and Solutions
Our electrified powertrain systems utilize Hyliion-designed control software and data analytics technology to control physically integrated battery systems, electric motors and power electronics. These electrified powertrain platforms can be used to either augment, as in the case of our Hybrid system, or fully replace, as in the case of our Hypertruck platform, conventional powertrains in Class 8 semi-trucks and improve their operational performance. Our solutions are designed to be compatible 
with most major Class 8 semi-truck manufacturers and are highly flexible in their digital and physical design, allowing them to be installed on, or adapted to, a variety of vehicles and fuel sources as market and regulatory opportunities allow. This platform-focused strategy reduces capital investment over time and aims to allow for faster time to market for Hyliion powertrain products.
Hybrid Powertrain System
Our Hybrid system can be installed on most major Class 8 semi-trucks to reduce fuel usage in the case of diesel applications and improve performance in the case of CNG applications. Our Hybrid system is comprised of a Hyliion battery system and an associated software management solution, a control module running our software and data analytics, high and low voltage power distribution and a thermal management system. The battery system and controllers can be attached to the frame rail of most major Class 8 semi-trucks, providing potential cost savings in the case of diesel and simplifying installation, and incorporating a custom e-axle solution with associated cooling box to reduce weight and improve system efficiencies. The system is charged by regenerative braking and downhill deceleration and discharged to provide additional horsepower and torque when called upon by our control software, thereby reducing engine load to reduce fuel usage and related GHG emissions or applying additional power to improve vehicle performance. Our Hybrid system’s battery power can also be utilized as an auxiliary power unit (“APU”) to supply electricity for in-cab devices and air conditioning to reduce or eliminate idling when the driver is “hoteling” in the truck. Based on internal and third-party testing and customer-reported experiences, we believe the benefits of utilizing our Hybrid system compared to conventional diesel or CNG commercial vehicles will reduce fuel usage, emissions, idling and improve performance.
We believe that reduced operating costs, improved driver satisfaction and increased marketability are key decision factors for many fleets in adopting our Hybrid system. Our Hybrid system can also help fleets transition from diesel to natural gas engines as a result of the increased performance the system provides, and because of the cost savings opportunity natural gas provides over diesel. The Hybrid system draws upon the real-world feedback we have received from customers and millions of miles logged by trucks equipped with the Hybrid system.
Hypertruck ERX System
Our Hypertruck ERX system is an electric CNG range extender powertrain that is being designed for integration on most major Class 8 semi-trucks to create a net-carbon-negative-capable REEV, when fueled by RNG. Our Hypertruck ERX system builds upon technical knowledge gained from our Hybrid system. It consists of a battery system, an associated software management and data analytics solution, a range extending electric generator powered by natural gas, an electric-traction drive system, and our Hyliion CoPilot in-cab driver display. The system works by pairing the fully electric powertrain with a battery system that is recharged by the onboard generator and regenerative braking that produces electricity. This system fully replaces the traditional powertrain in Class 8 semi-trucks. The first iteration of Hypertruck ERX system utilizes a battery system capable of operating up to 75 miles on battery-only power depending on factors including driver behavior, which qualifies it for ¾ of a ZEV credit under CARB’s ACT regulation.
Our Hypertruck ERX system combines the performance of fully electric powertrains with the refueling efficiency of conventionally-fueled vehicles. We estimate that it may be less expensive to run our onboard generator to produce electricity than recharging a BEV from the grid, depending on the cost of natural gas and electricity in different markets. Today’s market price for CNG and RNG is more stable than diesel, and natural gas often costs much less than diesel on an equivalent-gallon basis. By using onboard electricity generation rather than a large battery pack, our Hypertruck ERX system provides an extended range of operation compared to commercial BEVs.
We believe the benefits of our Hypertruck ERX system compared to competing technologies may include:
•a powertrain system as opposed to a complete vehicle redesign;
•a lower TCO due to favorable CNG/RNG pricing;
•government credits and incentives;
•the potential for net carbon negative operation when fueled with RNG;
•the ability to utilize existing natural gas fueling infrastructure;
•zero tailpipe emissions drive-capability;
•improved operating experience for the driver;
•vehicle range exceeding current competing electrified technologies;
•refueling times similar to diesel trucks; and/or
•data generation and connectivity for next-generation fleet management.
By providing up to 75 miles of all-electric range, the Hypertruck ERX system provides the capability of reducing GHG, pollutants, and noise emissions in communities surrounding trucking infrastructure, like warehouses, ports, rail yards, maintenance facilities and fueling infrastructure.
Depending on the source of natural gas used in its CNG generator, the Hypertruck ERX system can deliver significantly lower emissions than a conventional diesel-powered Class 8 semi-truck. Its electric traction drive provides up to 670 horsepower, in a smooth and seamless delivery, while simultaneously reducing overall noise and vibration levels. The electric motors in the Hypertruck ERX system provide instantaneous torque, with fewer gears and smoother operation than a conventional transmission. These factors combine to dramatically improve the driving experience for the operator, which should help with driver satisfaction and retention.
Hypertruck ERX System Rollout Timeline
In November 2021, we began our Hypertruck ERX system pre-production roadshow, which offered fleet owners and shippers firsthand demonstration of the features and benefits of our electric powertrain system. The roadshow continued throughout 2022 and included “Ride and Drive” events, which provide in-depth product education sessions on how our system operates and enables fleets to decarbonize while reducing total cost of ownership.
Throughout 2022 we made significant progress furthering development and testing of the Hypertruck ERX system and hit several important development milestones on a roadmap that we first laid out in late 2021. We completed assembly of the first verification vehicles early in the year. These vehicles are considerably more advanced than earlier prototypes and were used to begin on-road testing of the latest design along with Ride and Drive events and controlled fleet trials with customers. By the end of 2022, we had completed assembly of verification vehicles and released the design for the 3rd generation Hypertruck ERX system. Another milestone achieved was the successful completion of summer testing. We took four vehicles to Davis Dam in Arizona where they were subjected to rigorous operation, hauling heavy loads up steep grades in temperatures of up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
We also deployed verification vehicles into controlled fleet trial operations with customers where the trucks were used in standard freight hauling operations. Fleet trials provide the opportunity for Hyliion engineers and technicians to closely monitor vehicle operations and to obtain feedback from drivers on how well the powertrain functions. Late in 2022, we began subjecting verification vehicles to winter testing where we observe system operation in extremely cold conditions to validate component operability, including battery function. Additional winter testing sessions will continue through the early part of 2023. Fleet trials will also continue with additional customers and eventually be advanced to a level where the customer takes over daily operation of the trucks without Hyliion engineering technician support, reflecting real-world fleet usage expectations. Through all our testing and trial activities we expect to accumulate up to one million miles of operation prior to reaching the production stage.
Commercialization of the Hypertruck ERX system in 2023 is dependent upon receiving certain vehicle certifications by federal and state regulators. Specifically, CARB requires demonstration that our powertrain and vehicle comply with emissions standards for pollutants and particulate matter and that our on-board diagnostics technology operates reliably and in a manner to detect and diagnose malfunctions with the engine and emissions control systems and to alert the driver to the underlying condition so it can be remedied. Similarly, EPA certification is also required as is approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for the overall safe operation of the truck and powertrain. See Government Regulations section for additional details.
There have been ongoing parts shortages in the transportation industry supply chain including semiconductors and other key components. These supply chain challenges have been especially prominent in the trucking industry, and one of the impacts has been significantly extended lead times for ordering new trucks. Fleets are experiencing lead times on new truck purchases that extend delivery out into 2023. We are securing build slots with Peterbilt for all chassis needed for the 2023 calendar year to mitigate future potential supply chain impacts to our Hypertruck ERX system development schedule. We continue to work closely with our current supply base to improve delivery of components for the quarters ahead and are diligently seeking alternative sources of supply for components that meet our technical specifications with shorter lead times. 
CNG and RNG as a Fuel
Our Hypertruck ERX system will leverage an existing cross-country CNG fueling network. In the continental United States, there are approximately 700 public and 400 private CNG fueling stations in operation for Class 8 semi-trucks. These stations are geographically dispersed enabling nation-wide fleet operations without a significant infrastructure buildout. Furthermore, our Hypertruck ERX system can be refueled using a “fast-fill” method which is comparable to diesel truck refueling time. Internationally, CNG infrastructure is even more prevalent due to government mandates requiring reduced carbon emissions from transportation. Additionally, we believe that the necessary heavy-duty infrastructure exists that would support near-term adoption of our Hypertruck ERX system. The ability to utilize existing CNG fueling infrastructure eliminates an important 
barrier to Hypertruck ERX system adoption, in contrast to Class 8 BEVs and FCEVs, which currently lack the electric charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure needed for widespread adoption of those technologies.
Use of RNG is much cleaner for the environment than most other fuel sources. It is generated by capturing methane from landfills, livestock operations such as dairies, wastewater treatment and other sources or through anaerobic digestion and processing of food and animal waste streams. Depending on the source, RNG can have a significantly negative carbon intensity score as these methane sources would otherwise be emitted as pollution into the atmosphere. RNG is injected into existing natural gas pipelines and the delivery to fleets is enabled through credits. Use of RNG to fuel the Hypertruck ERX system can enable our customers to achieve a net carbon negative emissions profile for their transportation operations, depending on the region of operation.
RNG is widely available today through all 700 existing natural gas stations and new sources are in development. Approximately 64% of natural gas sold at fueling stations in 2021 was credited towards RNG projects with usage growing 134% over the five years ending 2021, according to the Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas. Also in 2021, 250 RNG production facilities were in operation, 112 were under construction and another 125 were in project development. 
Generator and Fuel Agnostic
Although our initial Hypertruck platform application, the Hypertruck ERX system, will be powered by a CNG fueled generator, it is designed to flexibly accommodate different generator and fuel system types in future applications. In addition to a natural gas ICE, other potential generator options include the Hyliion KARNO generator and hydrogen fuel cells. Any available electricity source can be used to recharge the battery of the electric powertrain system, although control systems and software may need to be modified to adapt to different generators, fuels, and electrical power sources. Our objective is to enable Hypertruck customers to choose their preferred charging system and fuel source based on different priorities, including fuel cost and availability and emissions objectives. By designing our system in this manner, we expect to be able to quickly adapt to changing technologies, emissions goals, fuel sources, regulatory requirements, and customer preferences without needing to redesign the underlying Hypertruck powertrain platform.
Software, Data Analytics and Computing
Hyliion's proprietary software and control systems are the foundation of the Hypertruck platform, linking the generator source, battery and battery systems, electric drive motors and driver interface into a seamless electric powertrain that is customizable, adaptable, and configurable. Beginning with the Hybrid system, Hyliion gained critical knowledge and experience in developing control software, powertrain algorithms, systems management capabilities, and cloud integration, which fed into the design of the Hypertruck platform.
Our software and algorithms seek to optimize the fuel economy and performance of our powertrain system by controlling efficient generator operation points and the charging and discharging of the battery system to power the electric motor and electronics. Our software and control algorithms can be remotely updated over the air to enable our customers to benefit from the latest features and functionalities, minimizing unnecessary downtime. This cloud-connected capability also provides the data sources for future features, without fundamentally changing the hardware of the system, which could otherwise require large amounts of capital and resources. As demonstrated with the Hybrid system, Hyliion has developed different applications that solve different customer problems. Beyond adjusting for different applications on the same vehicle platform type, we expect this software design philosophy to also ease the Hypertruck platform’s transition to entirely different vehicle platform types.
We have the potential to develop value-added software services based on the insights gathered on our vehicles. This includes cloud-accessed insights into powertrain performance, maintenance, and other logistics and fleet management services. It also allows for fleet-level customization of powertrain features and performance, without physically touching the vehicle or changing its hardware.
A critical component of our system is the Hyliion CoPilot, which runs on our in-cab display and provides real-time vehicle performance, status metrics, and driving feedback to the vehicle operator. We have also developed proprietary in-vehicle computing capabilities, in the form of the Hyliion Control Unit (“HCU”) and Hyliion Drive Processor (“HDP”). These two units form the core of the Hypertruck computing platform, and are easily adapted to future product iterations and platforms.
Challenges with Other Solutions
With a global focus on reducing the environmental impact of commercial transportation, several companies have begun developing solutions to lower GHG emissions from commercial vehicles, including plug-in commercial BEVs and commercial FCEVs. However, neither of these solutions have been delivered in volume for the high mileage regional and long-haul Class 8 semi-truck markets. While we do see market opportunities for these solutions, we believe they will face unique challenges achieving widespread adoption in the near term, which may include:
•limited availability of such commercial vehicles or solutions;
•a higher TCO relative to currently-available diesel or CNG commercial vehicles;
•limited availability and capacity of electric charging and hydrogen fueling infrastructure;
•higher lifecycle GHG emissions from the fuel sources used to generate electricity needed to recharge batteries or produce hydrogen and the emissions associated with the production of the battery cells;
•the need or choice to completely redesign the commercial vehicle to implement the solution;
•limited range on a single charge or fueling;
•longer recharging or refueling times compared to diesel and natural gas-fueled vehicles;
•the need to change customers’ existing fleet operations to accommodate new truck technologies, including procurement, dispatch, maintenance, repair, and driver training; and
•performance challenges in cold weather.
Strategy
Our mission is to be the leading provider of electrified solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Our value proposition to our customers includes reducing GHG emissions, operating cost savings, improved truck performance, and the ability to utilize existing infrastructure for fueling. We anticipate that our capital resources and efforts in the near future will continue to focus on the development and commercialization of our drivetrain solutions.
Maintaining Technology Leadership and First-Mover Advantage
Our Hybrid system is currently being sold, and we are one of the first to the market with an electric powertrain solution for long-haul Class 8 semi-trucks. The software and the algorithms driving our Hybrid system have been utilized in millions of real-world road miles and experience with the Hybrid product is being used to drive continuous improvements in the system management software and our overall knowledge of electric drivetrain operations. We expect to capture market share for low and zero-emission commercial vehicles by being one of the first to market with a carbon-negative-capability powertrain and by offering a range-extending power generator to help bridge the industry from fossil-fuel-powered trucks to full electric vehicles over time.
We believe that decarbonizing long-distance Class 8 trucking through electrification will be a process that occurs over time as reliable sources of clean, renewable electricity are developed along with the transmission and distribution networks that support a widely available and fast electric vehicle charging network. In the same manner, the use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel will depend upon the development of new sources of supply that don’t themselves contribute to GHG emissions and a fueling and distribution network that does not exist today. Therefore, we believe that an electric range-extender powertrain system, such as the Hypertruck ERX system, will be needed as a transition technology to reduce GHG, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions, while offering all-electric range, improved operating performance and TCO savings. By launching the Hypertruck ERX system, followed by the Hypertruck KARNO system, and a Hypertruck fuel cell truck, we will help drive an industry transition to clean transportation in a manner that is most likely to be successful. 
Focusing on Powertrains
Our electrified powertrain solutions are designed to be installed on most Class 8 semi-trucks. By focusing on the powertrain and its associated components, rather than the full vehicle, we obtain advantages as a new entrant in the Class 8 truck market. First, our innovative efforts focus on the vehicle components that drive the greatest improvement in economic and environmental benefits towards decarbonizing transportation. Second, our approach allows us to remain capital-light and use our resources more efficiently to develop software and engineered solutions to powertrain development, while leaving most component production and major vehicle design and assembly work with existing suppliers and truck OEMs.
Leveraging Existing Infrastructure
Our customers will be able to utilize an existing network of approximately 700 CNG fueling stations across the United States, which will help accelerate adoption of our Hypertruck ERX system. Utilizing CNG allows for electrified Class 8 semi-truck solutions like the Hypertruck ERX system to grow without substantial new infrastructure. This is in contrast with BEV trucks, where broader availability of electric charging stations will require significant investment and long lead times, driven in part by the uncertain availability and cost of electric power as charging demand for passenger vehicles and electric trucks grows. By utilizing existing commercial natural gas fueling infrastructure, we believe our customers can achieve low GHG emissions, when utilizing CNG, or carbon-negative status, when utilizing RNG. While hydrogen sources and refueling stations are also in development, there are few options available today for local, regional or long-haul truck transportation. Therefore, it is likely that significant additional investment and time will be required before hydrogen is a feasible fuel source for Class 8 trucks.
Continuing to Build and Leverage Strategic Relationships
We have and intend to continue developing partnerships with suppliers, truck OEMs, fuel and maintenance service providers, truck upfitting operators, engineering firms, consultants and others to accelerate the development and production of our solutions. These partners augment our internal resources and we intend to leverage their capabilities and infrastructure to bring our solutions to market more quickly and to meet industry standards without requiring us to invest additional capital to internalize functions or services that are more easily outsourced. We are planning to develop agreements with one or more maintenance service providers and fueling partners to ensure that our powertrain systems are fully supported in the field once commercial production begins and so our customers have access to CNG/RNG and attractive prices in the marketplace.
Customer Demand
We began selling the Hybrid system in the fourth quarter of 2021. Throughout 2022, we delivered Hybrid systems to fleets across the country, utilizing vehicle platforms from multiple OEMs. Despite these successes, we were unable to fulfill all Hybrid system orders that we obtained from customers due to ongoing supply chain disruptions and the limited ability of our customers to incur the downtime with their existing truck fleets to complete the Hybrid system installation. Delivery of Hybrid systems in 2023 is expected to continue on a pace consistent with the rate of deliveries in 2022. Commercialization of the Hypertruck ERX system late in 2023 is expected to divert customer interest from our Hybrid product to the Hypertruck ERX system. In addition, we continually assess the potential demand impact for the Hybrid system offering in light of recent changes within the competitive landscape.
In 2021, we announced our Hypertruck Innovation Council, which consists of some of the largest fleets in the industry, who have assisted us with the development of the Hypertruck ERX system and will have been among the first to experience the performance of the system through our “Ride and Drive” events. These events and fleet trials delivered positive feedback from customers’ drivers, and generated further interest in the Hypertruck ERX system.
In 2022 we secured deposit-backed orders from eleven fleet customers for our first 210 production slots for the Hypertruck ERX system. These trucks are all expected to be delivered to customers by the end of the first quarter of 2024 and will be deployed in what we are calling our Founders Program. The Founders Program will feature white-glove service and support from a launch facility in the Dallas area. Recognizing that the Hypertruck ERX system is a new product, we plan to ensure that it is well supported through drivetrain warranty protection and the ability to quickly resolve hardware and software problems or address operator questions and issues as they arise.
We will use the launch facility as a location to centralize our maintenance and service operations and to train electric drive train technicians, both our own and those of our service partners. We also expect to offer fueling support to make it convenient for fleets to fill up on renewable natural gas. The fleet support capabilities being offered by the Founders Program will be beneficial as we look to grow our order book with new customers and support a larger number of our systems on the road.
We expect that the steps we are taking to complete development, testing and certification of the Hypertruck ERX system, along with additional customer fleet trials and a successful commercialization and launch of the Founders Program, will be an inflection point for additional orders. As these milestones are achieved, we will continue to grow our order backlog for delivery of trucks with Hypertruck ERX system in 2024 and beyond.
Production, Assembly and Installation
Our long-term strategy is to be a powertrain company, and we expect to sell our solutions directly to truck OEMs for them to integrate into their production lines. However, as we launch production we plan to source incomplete chassis from the OEM and then utilize our facility in Austin, Texas and/or modification and upfitting centers that are close to OEM factories to install our Hypertruck ERX system. Initial incomplete chassis will include the natural gas engine but not certain components like the transmission, driveshaft and diesel fuel tanks. We intend to primarily outsource the production, assembly and installation of our electrified powertrain systems to assembly partners as we reach a greater level of production volume, while maintaining in-house research, development and prototyping capabilities, including low-volume assembly and installation.
The initial production version of the Hypertruck ERX system will utilize a Peterbilt 579 truck in sleeper configuration. Over time, we expect to utilize additional OEM platforms in different configurations.
Sales and Marketing
We currently market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions domestically through a direct sales organization and with certain partners to Class 8 semi-truck fleet owners and operators. We also expect to market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions internationally at some point in the future. We use digital marketing strategies to build awareness for the Hyliion brand, the in-market Hybrid offering and the development journey of the Hypertruck ERX system. Events and in-person activations, particularly those that allow prospective customers to physically interact with our products, often lead to positive results in an industry that is relationship-based and focused on “trying before they buy.”
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law in August 2022, under which the Hypertruck ERX system will qualify fleets to receive a 30% tax credit up to $40,000 per vehicle adopted. We expect this to drive further interest in and demand for the Hypertruck ERX system and other products.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities primarily take place at our headquarters in Cedar Park, Texas, our facility in West Chester, Ohio, on our testing and demonstration vehicles on roads and highways, and at our partners’ facilities. Our research and development is primarily focused on:
•electrified powertrain development and system integration;
•control software and algorithms for our powertrain systems;
•next generation packaging and cooling for our battery systems;
•interoperability with third-party powertrain components, such as e-motors, inverters and axles;
•component integration;
•development of the KARNO generator including testing and validation;
•integration of the KARNO generator technology into the Hypertruck system;
•accelerated lifetime testing processes to improve reliability, maintainability and system-level robustness;
•data analytics; and
•alternative products for existing and in-development components and technology.
The majority of our current activities are focused on the research and development of our electrified powertrain systems, third-party component integration and the underlying proprietary battery and software technology platforms. We undertake significant testing and validation of our products and components to ensure that they will meet the demands of our customers.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is important to our business, and we seek protection for our strategic intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and trademarks, along with employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 47 issued U.S. patents and 51 pending U.S. patent applications. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in some locations abroad. In an effort to protect our brand, as of December 31, 2022, we had three registered and seven pending trademarks in the United States and 39 registered and 11 pending trademarks internationally.
We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications as we consider appropriate under the circumstances relating to the new technologies that we develop.
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 250 full-time employees all located within the United States. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. Our people are integral to our business, and we are highly dependent on our ability to attract, engage, develop and retain key employees while hiring qualified management, technical, and vehicle engineering personnel. We seek to provide our employees with competitive compensation and benefits, including grants of equity under our equity incentive plans, access to 401(k) plans and medical, life and disability insurance. In addition, we provide several supplemental health plans of our employees’ choosing. We welcome the diversity of all team members and encourage the integration of their unique skills, thoughts, experiences and identities. By fostering an inclusive culture, we enable every member of the workforce to leverage their unique talents and deliver high-performance standards to drive innovation and success. Our production, research and development employees mainly work in our Austin headquarters and other facilities, which have implemented practices including company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. We have developed a flexible work policy that 
allows certain employees to work from home. While we are currently still a small company in terms of headcount, we have plans to grow, and expect that our practices and programs with respect to human capital management will grow as we do.
Government Regulations
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others:
•water use;
•air emissions;
•use of recycled materials;
•energy sources;
•the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials;
•the protection of the environment;
•natural resources and endangered species; and
•the remediation of environmental contamination. 
We may be required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, and our product are sold, and standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses that we hold. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations, or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, orders to cease the violating operations, or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.
EPA and CARB Emissions Compliance and Certification
Under the U.S. Clean Air Act, some of our electrified powertrain solutions may be required to obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a series of California Executive Orders issued by CARB, demonstrating that our powertrains and vehicles comply with requirements including as applicable, emission standards for both criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and particulate matter (“PM”), and GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (“CO2”) and nitrous oxide (“N2O”). A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in all states and Executive Orders are required for vehicles sold in California and states that have adopted the California standards. There are currently six states that have adopted the California standard for heavy-duty vehicles, five states are pursuing adoption of some or all of the CARB standards through a formal rulemaking process and an additional six states are considering adoption of some or all of the CARB standards.
CARB has adopted an ACT rule that requires heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to produce and sell in California a certain number of zero-emission vehicles. In addition to California, a growing number of other states follow the CARB regulatory framework and are also adopting ACT. If the heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers do not meet the applicable requirements, they will be deemed unable to sell the rest of their portfolio in that state, creating a significant incentive to deploy ZEV and NZEV vehicles that meet the need of fleet customers. CARB is also considering a fleet-facing zero-emission vehicle mandate (ACF), which acts in a similar manner to ACT by requiring truck operators to add an increasing percentage of ZEV and NZEV vehicles to their fleets over time. All vehicles and engines manufactured for sale in the United States must be covered by an EPA Certificate of Conformity (and respective CARB Executive Orders if sold in California), including engines and vehicles using zero-emission or low-carbon technology. As is necessary, an EPA Certificate of Conformity and/or CARB Executive Order, covering both criteria pollutants and GHG, must be obtained each model year for each engine family and heavy-duty vehicle.
Manufacturers of heavy-duty engines and vehicles also must ensure that their products comply with On Board Diagnostics (“OBD”) requirements. The OBD system is intended to identify and diagnose malfunctions within the engine, aftertreatment and emission control systems and alert the driver to the underlying issue so the vehicle can be brought in for service. CARB issues approval of the OBD system as part of its issuance of an Executive Order; the EPA typically deems CARB OBD approval to be compliant with the EPA’s requirements. As with emissions compliance, manufacturers are required to ensure that the OBD system functions as designed and is able to identify component malfunctions throughout the full useful life of the vehicle or engine.
We are currently in the process of obtaining the certifications required from both CARB and the EPA to confirm conformity with applicable regulations. This effort includes demonstrating that our system complies with emissions standards for criteria 
pollutants and that our OBD systems are capable of detecting deviations from these standards throughout their operating life. We expect to obtain needed certifications prior to the start of Hypertruck ERX commercialization in the second half of 2023.
Inflation Reduction Act
The Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. became law in August 2022. Trucks with the Hypertruck ERX system are eligible under the Inflation Reduction Act for a 30% tax credit of up to $40,000 per vehicle. On December 29, 2022 the United States Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) released guidance relating to the electric vehicle tax credit provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 including guidance on the commercial clean vehicle tax credit (section “45W”) for businesses. Businesses and tax-exempt organizations that buy a qualified commercial clean vehicle may qualify for a clean vehicle tax credit of up to $40,000 under Internal Revenue Code 45W. The credit equals the lesser of:
•15% of the basis in the vehicle (30% if the vehicle is not powered by gas or diesel);
•The incremental cost of the vehicle; or
•The maximum credit is $7,500 for qualified vehicles with gross vehicle weight ratings (“GVWR”s) of under 14,000 pounds and $40,000 for all other vehicles.
There is no limit on the number of credits businesses can claim.
ZEV Credits and Other
In California, the Advanced Clean Truck Rule was passed in June of 2020 and placed a requirement on heavy duty truck manufactures to produce and sell zero emission vehicles as a percentage of their total sales, beginning in 2024. The sales requirements gradually increase every year until 2035. The basic structure is that manufacturers will accumulate deficits when they sell conventionally fuel vehicles. These deficits can be offset by the accumulation of credits which are earned as ZEVs and NZEVs are sold. NZEVs generate credits based on their minimum all-electric range (“AER”). The credits are calculated by multiplying the AER by 0.01. As an example, if a customer is to purchase an electric vehicle with an AER of 35 miles, the sale would produce 35% of a credit. NZEV credits cannot exceed 75%. 
The California Air Resource Board is currently reviewing a draft rulemaking called the Advanced Clean Fleet Rule that is expected to be released in 2023. The Advanced Clean Fleet Rule is a medium and heavy-duty zero-emission fleet regulation with the goal of achieving a zero-emission truck and bus California fleet by 2045. The primary goal of the ACF regulation is to accelerate the market for zero-emission trucks, vans, and buses by requiring fleets that are well suited for electrification, to transition to ZEVs where feasible.
GHG Credits — U.S. EPA
The EPA’s GHG Regulation requires all manufacturers of heavy-duty engines and vehicles to comply with fleet average GHG standards. Manufacturers may comply with the standards by producing engines or vehicles, all of which comply with the standards, or by averaging, banking and trading GHG credits within vehicle or engine categories. Manufacturers may also comply with GHG standards by purchasing credits from manufacturers with a surplus of credits. The failure to comply with GHG standards can lead to civil penalties or the voiding of a manufacturer’s EPA Certificate of Conformity. In connection with the delivery and placement into service of zero-emission and low-emission vehicles, we may earn tradable GHG credits that under current laws and regulations can be sold to other manufacturers. Under the EPA’s GHG Regulation, plug-in hybrid, all-electric and fuel cell vehicles can earn a credit multiplier of 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5, respectively, for use in the calculation of GHG emission credits.
Commercial engine and vehicle manufacturers are required to meet the NOx emission standard for each type of engine or vehicle produced. Typical diesel engine emission control technology limits the fuel economy and GHG improvements that can be made while maintaining compliance with the NOx standard. As the fleet-average GHG standards continue to decrease over time, compliance with the NOx standard will increase the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the applicable GHG standard. Until technology catches up for commercial vehicles, manufacturers of diesel trucks will likely need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The EPA’s GHG Regulation provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation does not limit the number of GHG credits that can be sold within the same commercial vehicle categories.
GHG Credits — California Air Resources Board
California also has a separate GHG emissions regulatory program, which is very similar to the EPA requirements. Like the EPA’s GHG Rule, the CARB rule allows for averaging, banking and trading of credits to comply with the fleet-average GHG standard and the failure to comply with the California GHG standard may lead to the imposition of civil penalties. The delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission and low-emission vehicles in California may earn us tradable credits that can be sold. Under CARB GHG regulations, advanced technology vehicles can also earn a credit multiplier of for use in the calculation of emission credits in the same amounts as under the EPA’s GHG Rule.
Heavy-Duty Vehicle Safety Requirements
Manufacturers of vehicles that operate on US highways are subject to, and must comply with, various regulations established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). These federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”) cover a wide variety of vehicle equipment and components. Manufacturers of vehicles, including heavy-duty vehicles, must confirm that their vehicles and vehicle equipment comply with applicable standards or, as appropriate, are exempt from those standards. Currently, there are several FMVSS that apply to vehicle manufacturers and may be applicable to Hyliion’s Hybrid and Hypertruck platforms. As may be required, Hyliion is evaluating FMVSS requirements for applicability to Hyliion products.
Manufacturers of vehicles that operate on US highways must also comply with NHTSA safety reporting requirements concerning safety involving Hyliion systems concerning various issues including, but not limited to, accidents, warranty claims, field actions and reports and recalls. As situations may arise, Hyliion will take appropriate actions to comply with these reporting requirements.
Competition
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition from a number of companies, particularly as the commercial transportation sector increasingly shifts towards low-emission, zero-emission, or carbon-neutral solutions. We face competition from many different sources, including major commercial vehicle OEMs and companies that are developing alternative fuel and electric commercial vehicles. Existing commercial vehicle OEMs such as PACCAR, Navistar, Volvo, Mack Trucks and Daimler maintain the largest market shares in the sector. Given we primarily develop and sell powertrains that are designed to be installed into an OEM’s commercial vehicle to augment or replace conventionally fueled powertrains, as opposed to a complete commercial vehicle, we believe we will primarily compete with other powertrain providers offering new low-emissions solutions as opposed to commercial vehicle manufacturers. While there are many competitors addressing electrification of commercial vehicles, many of them are focused on shorter range and lighter-duty vehicles. We are providing electrified solutions that are addressing both the long-haul and regional transportation sectors. We believe the primary competitive factors in the long-haul Class 8 semi-truck market include, but are not limited to:
•total cost of ownership;
•emissions profile;
•availability of charging or fueling network;
•ease of integration into existing operations;
•product performance and uptime;
•vehicle quality, reliability and safety;
•vehicle support, parts and on-road service network;
•technological innovation specifically around battery, software and data analytics; and
•fleet management.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors; however, most of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than us. Our competitors may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their alternative fuel and electric truck programs. Additionally, our competitors also have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships and other tangible and intangible resources than us. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. We cannot provide assurances that our electrified systems will be the first to market. Even if our electrified systems are first to market, or among the first to market, we cannot be sure that customers will choose vehicles with our electrified systems over those of our competitors, or over conventional natural gas or diesel-powered vehicles.
Numerous companies, including Cummins, Daimler, Dana, Navistar, PACCAR, Volvo, Tesla, Nikola, Lion Electric, Hyzon and other commercial vehicle manufacturers have announced their plans to bring Class 8 semi-truck BEVs or FCEVs to the market. However, we do not believe any of them have showcased a roadmap similar to Hyliion’s, which is based on offering a range-extender electric vehicle that utilizes various generators with different fuel sources as a product that helps trucking transition from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to fully electric vehicles over time as technology advances and fueling and recharging infrastructure becomes more readily available and reliable. Furthermore, we will also face competition from 
manufacturers of more powerful internal combustion engines powered by natural gas and diesel fuel. We expect additional competitors may enter the market as well, particularly if we are successful with the Hypertruck platform.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.

1A. RISK FACTORS
Investing in our securities involves risks. Before you make a decision to buy our securities, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider the specific risks set forth herein. If any of these risks actually occur, it may materially harm our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. As a result, the market price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additionally, the risks and uncertainties described are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may become material and adversely affect our business.
Risks Related to our Business
We are an early-stage company with a history of losses, and expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses for the foreseeable future.
We incurred a net loss of $153.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and have incurred cumulative net operating losses of $277.3 million during the previous three years ended December 31, 2022. We believe that we will continue to incur significant operating and net losses each quarter until we are generating positive gross margins from selling our powertrain systems that exceeds our operating expenses. We do not expect to reach this level of financial performance in 2023, and may not ever. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell our electrified powertrain solutions, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful. Our potential profitability is dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of our electrified powertrain solutions, which may not occur.
We will require significant capital to develop and grow our business, including developing, producing and servicing our electrified powertrain solutions, our KARNO generator product, and our brand. We expect to incur significant expenses, which will impact our profitability and available capital, including costs for research and development efforts, component and service procurement, sales, general and administrative costs, and production, distribution and support of our electrified powertrain solutions. We also expect to utilize more of our cash to grow working capital as we procure component parts for commercialization of our Hypertruck ERX powertrain system.
 Our ability to become profitable in the future will require us to complete the design and development of electrified powertrain solutions that meet projected performance criteria. We must also successfully market our electrified powertrain solutions and services to customers, sell our systems at prices needed to achieve positive gross margins and control operating and production costs. We may need to sell our products at a loss or discounted prices in the near term in order to win initial customer orders and gain the confidence of fleet customers. If we are unable to efficiently design, produce, market, sell, distribute and service our electrified powertrain solutions or generator, our margins, profitability, and long-term prospects will be materially and adversely affected.
We are in the early stages of developing key commercial relationships with suppliers and customers, and our ability to predict the outcome of those relationships is limited.
We are in the process of developing relationships to accelerate the development, production and sale of our solutions. We have deployed Hybrid and Hypertruck ERX system units to certain companies we expect to be customers in the future; however, all of our commercial relationships are in the early stages of development and we do not have the ability to predict with certainty the outcome of those relationships. Our suppliers may face delays or be unable to meet our business requirements and standards at the quantity, quality, timeliness and price levels needed for our business. The entities that we expect to be customers in the future may decide not to do business with us. Because we are still getting to know our suppliers and customers, these relationships could result in controversies or even litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our plans for strategic growth and ultimately our business results.
We are highly dependent on the services of Thomas Healy, our Chief Executive Officer, and if we are unable to retain Mr. Healy, attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and vehicle engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. We are highly dependent on the services of Thomas Healy, our Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder. Mr. Healy is the source of many of the ideas and execution driving us. If Mr. Healy were to discontinue his service with us due to death, disability or any other reason, we would be significantly disadvantaged. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.
If we fail to manage our growth effectively, including failing to attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to develop, produce, market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions successfully.
Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We intend to expand our operations significantly. We intend to continue to hire additional personnel, including software engineers, design and production personnel and service technicians for our electrified powertrain solutions. Because our electrified powertrain solutions are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines, individuals with sufficient training in alternative fuel and electric vehicles may not be available to hire, and as a result, we may need to expend significant time and expense training any newly hired employees. Competition for individuals with experience designing, producing and servicing electrified vehicles and their software is intense, and we may not be able to attract, integrate, train, motivate, or retain additional highly qualified personnel, particularly with respect to software engineers in the Austin, Texas area where we are headquartered. Due to the specific skills required, the strong job market nationally and the high cost of living and competition in the Austin, Texas area, we may experience increased compensation, recruiting and relocation expenses to achieve our hiring goals. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Risks Related to our Products
If our electrified powertrain solutions fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions could be harmed.
Our electrified powertrain solutions may contain defects in design and production that may cause them not to perform as expected or they may require repair. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our electrified powertrain solutions. Our electrified powertrain solutions may not meet customers’ expectations or perform competitively with other vehicles that may become available. Any product defects or any other failure of our electrified powertrain solutions and software to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, negative publicity, product liability claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
The performance characteristics of our electrified powertrain solutions, including fuel economy, range between refueling, and emissions levels, may vary, including due to factors outside of our control.
Our electrified powertrain solutions are still being designed and developed, and there are no assurances that they will be able to meet their projected performance characteristics, including fuel economy, range between refueling, and emissions levels. External factors (such as driver behavior, weather conditions, hardware efficiency, payload and terrain) may also impact the performance characteristics of our electrified powertrain solutions related to estimated fuel savings, GHG emissions and fuel economy of vehicles installed with our electrified powertrain solutions. These external factors as well as any operation of our electrified powertrain solutions other than as intended, may result in emissions levels that are greater than we expect. The ability of our electrified powertrain solutions to have a net-carbon-negative profile, will depend on the availability of renewable natural gas as well as the infrastructure necessary to purchase RNG through fuel providers. Any limitation on the ability to purchase RNG, such as a decrease or a limitation on the number of natural gas fueling stations or limitation on the production of natural gas and RNG in particular, will negatively impact the anticipated carbon intensity profile of our electrified powertrain solutions. In addition, the carbon intensity profiles could vary based on the source of RNG, which could reduce a fleet’s ability 
to have favorable carbon intensity scores. Due to these factors, there can be no guarantee that the operators of vehicles using our electrified powertrain solutions will realize the expected fuel savings, range and fuel economy and GHG emission reductions.
Our beliefs regarding the ability of our electrified powertrain solutions to limit carbon intensity and reduce GHG emissions and contribute to global decarbonization may be based on materially inaccurate assumptions.
Our beliefs regarding our ability to reduce carbon intensity and GHG emissions are based on certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, our projections of the use of natural gas and renewable natural gas in the future, fuel types used, the ability to obtain carbon credits, driver behavior and our electrified powertrain solutions’ efficiencies and performance. To the extent our assumptions are materially incorrect or incomplete, it could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if our assumptions regarding the ability of our solutions to limit carbon intensity and reduce GHG emissions from trucking operations are materially incorrect or incomplete, or if our beliefs regarding the availability of our products are materially incorrect or incomplete, it is possible that our competitors’ technology may be better at limiting carbon intensity and reducing GHG emissions in certain circumstances and in certain markets.
We have limited experience servicing our electrified powertrain solutions and our integrated software. If we are unable to address the service requirements of our customers, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
We have limited experience in servicing our electrified powertrain solutions and expect to increase our servicing capabilities as we begin commercial production of our electrified powertrain solutions. Servicing hybrid and electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and traditional mechanical powertrains and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. We plan to partner with one or more third party service providers to perform some or all of the servicing on our electrified powertrain solutions, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an acceptable arrangement with any such third-party provider. Our ability to provide effective customer support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel with experience in supporting customers on platforms such as ours. As we continue to grow, additional pressure may be placed on our customer support team, and we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for maintenance services and technical support. If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our customers or establish a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, we may be subject to claims from our customers, including loss of revenue or damages, and our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
Our electrified powertrain solutions rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.
Our electrified powertrain solutions rely on software and hardware to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. Such software and hardware, that is developed or maintained internally or by third parties, is highly technical and complex and will require modification and updates over the life of the vehicle. Our software and hardware may contain, errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. If we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, we may suffer damage to our reputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.
Product liability claims, even those without merit or those that do not involve our products, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims, and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our electric powertrain solutions do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other commercial vehicle suppliers, we expect in the future that our electrified powertrain solutions will be installed on vehicles that will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury. Additionally, product liability claims that affect our competitors may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products.
Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of electrified powertrain solutions delivered to date and limited field experience of our products. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. In some jurisdictions, we may self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for 
vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds, not by insurance. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business and financial condition.
Insufficient warranty reserves to cover future warranty claims could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We maintain warranty reserves to cover warranty-related claims of our electrified powertrain solutions. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, or our parts suppliers fail to provide warranties for, or honor warranty claims against, their parts, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses as well as claims from our customers, including loss of revenue or damages. There can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims.
Risks Related to our Financial Results
Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.
Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•the pace at which we continue to design, develop and produce new products and increase production capacity;
•the number of customer orders in a given period;
•changes in manufacturing costs;
•the timing and cost of and level of investment in, research and development relating to our technologies and our current or future facilities;
•relationships, partnerships, contracts and other agreements with suppliers and development partners;
•our ability to achieve favorable pricing from suppliers for component purchases;
•our ability to obtain required certifications for our powertrain systems;
•developments involving our competitors; and
•changes in governmental regulations or applicable law.
As a result of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be overly focused on quarterly financial results or financial valuation models that do not match our expected growth plan. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.
Risks Related to our Customers
We may not be able to successfully engage target customers or convert early trial deployments with truck fleets into meaningful orders or additional deployments in the future.
Our success, and our ability to increase revenue and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to identify target customers and to convert early trial deployments with truck fleets into meaningful orders or additional deployments in the future. If we are unable to meet our customers’ performance requirements or industry specifications, identify target customers or convert early trial deployments into meaningful orders or obtain additional deployments in the future, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if we or our customers find that our Hybrid system does not perform as expected or if our orders for Hybrid systems do not materialize in large numbers, we may cease to distribute our Hybrid system, or recall some or all of our product, and future distributions may be delayed or cease for some period of time or indefinitely.
We plan to accept reservation orders for the sale of our electrified powertrain solutions that are cancellable, and our initial pre-launch sales order and reservations for Hypertruck ERX-equipped trucks are cancellable.
Our Hypertruck ERX electrified powertrain solution is still in the development and testing phase and commercial deliveries are not expected to begin until late 2023 or later, and may not occur at all. As a result, we plan to accept reservation orders for trucks equipped with our Hypertruck ERX system that are cancellable by customers without penalty. As a result, no assurance can be made that reservations will not be cancelled or that reservations will result in the purchase of our electrified powertrain solutions, and any such cancellations could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We may also enter into contracts for the sale of our electrified powertrain solutions that include various cancellation rights in favor of the customer. For example, in May 2020, we entered into a pre-launch sales agreement (the “Agility Pre-Launch Agreement”) with Agility Logistics Cargo Transport Co. WLL (“Agility Transport”), a company organized under the laws of and based in Kuwait and a subsidiary of Agility Public Warehousing Company K.S.C.P. for up to 1,000 trucks equipped with our Hypertruck ERX system in one or more future purchase orders, subject to certain testing and performance requirements and 
termination rights, including a right to terminate the Agility Pre-Launch Agreement prior to purchasing all or any portion of Agility Transport’s pre-order. The Agility Pre-Launch Agreement does not specify the terms or period upon which these purchase orders may be entered into, such that our sale of Hypertruck ERX system to Agility Transport is subject to the parties reaching further agreement on the terms of the purchase agreements. Any termination, reduction or dispute related to this agreement or others similar to it could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We intend to sell our electrified powertrain solutions to large commercial vehicle OEM customers and large-volume private-fleet and for-hire trucking customers. The failure to obtain such customers, loss of sales to such customers, ability to sell full trucks or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract negotiations could have an adverse impact on our business.
We intend to sell our electrified powertrain solutions to commercial vehicle OEMs and other large volume customers including private and for-hire trucking fleets. We may not be able to establish relationships with such OEMs or large volume customers if customer demand is not as high as we expect or if commercial vehicle OEMs face pressure from their existing suppliers not to purchase our electrified powertrain solutions. We may enter into long-term contracts with certain of these commercial vehicle OEMs and other large volume customers, who have substantial bargaining power with respect to price and other commercial terms, and any long-term contracts would be subject to renegotiation and renewal from time to time. Failure to obtain new customers, loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any customers for whatever reason (including, but not limited to, loss of contracts or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations, loss of market share by these customers, insolvency of such customers, reduced or delayed customer requirements, plant shutdowns, strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by such customers), or continued reduction of prices to these customers could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or retain large volume customers or that we will be able to offset any reduction of prices to these customers with reductions in our costs or by obtaining new customers.
Demand for our products will ultimately depend on end user customers, some of whom operate in highly cyclical industries, which may subject us to the performance of their industries and can result in uncertainty and significantly impact the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Demand for our products will ultimately depend on our end-user customers, some of whom operate in highly cyclical industries. Demand in these industries is impacted by numerous factors, including commodity prices, infrastructure spending, housing starts, real estate equity values, interest rates, consumer spending, fuel costs, energy demands, municipal spending and commercial construction, among others. Increases or decreases in these variables may significantly impact the demand for our products. If we are unable to accurately predict demand, we may be unable to meet our customers’ needs, resulting in the loss of potential sales, or we may produce excess products, resulting in increased inventories and overcapacity in our production facilities, increasing our unit production cost and decreasing our operating margins.
Risks Related to our Production Processes and Supply Chain
We face significant barriers to produce our electrified powertrain solutions, and if we cannot successfully overcome those barriers our business will be negatively impacted.
The commercial trucking industry has traditionally been characterized by significant barriers to entry, including the ability to meet performance requirements or industry specifications, acceptance by OEMs and our end users, large capital requirements, investment costs of design and production, long lead times to bring components to market from the concept and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements, establishing a brand name and image and the need to establish sales capabilities. If we are not able to overcome these barriers, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed.
Our success will depend on our ability to economically outsource the production, assembly and installation of our electrified powertrain solutions at scale, and our ability to develop and produce electrified powertrain solutions of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and at scale is unproven.
Our business depends in large part on our ability to execute our plans to develop, produce, install, assemble, market, sell, and service our electrified powertrain solutions. We currently produce our Hybrid system at our facility in Cedar Park, Texas and expect to begin production of our Hypertruck ERX system in late 2023, at the earliest. Over time, we anticipate we will shift production to our outsourcing partners’ facilities. We anticipate that a significant concentration of this production, assembly and installation will be performed by a small number of outsourcing partners. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, 
they also reduce our direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or our flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Our continued development of our electrified powertrain solutions is and will be subject to risks, including with respect to:
•the equipment we plan to use being able to accurately produce our electrified powertrain solutions within specified design tolerances;
•the compatibility of our electrified powertrain solutions with existing and future commercial vehicle designs;
•long- and short-term durability of the components in our electrified powertrain solutions in the day-to-day wear and tear of the commercial trucking environment;
•compliance with environmental, workplace safety and similar regulations;
•the ability or willingness of our suppliers to deliver key components to our desired specifications, in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, and in the quantities we require;
•delays in delivery of final component designs to our suppliers;
•our ability to attract, recruit, hire and train skilled employees;
•quality controls, particularly as we plan to expand our production capabilities;
•delays or disruptions in our supply chain;
•other delays and cost overruns; and
•our ability to secure additional funding if necessary.
We and our future production partners have no experience to date in high-volume production of our electrified powertrain solutions. We do not know whether we or our future production partners will be able to develop efficient, automated, low-cost production capabilities and processes and reliable sources of component supply, that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes required to successfully mass market our electrified powertrain solutions or whether we or our production partners will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, or in time to meet our vehicle commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. Any failure to develop such production processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We may experience significant delays in the design, production and launch of our electrified powertrain solutions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Our electrified powertrain solutions are still in the development and testing phase, and commercial deliveries of the Hypertruck ERX system are not expected to begin until late 2023 or later, and may not occur at all. Any delay in the financing, design, production and launch of our electrified powertrain solutions, including future production of our Hybrid system and Hypertruck ERX system at our outsourcing partners, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We are dependent on large commercial vehicle OEMs and producers of de-contented chassis to provide vehicles for our electrified powertrain solutions.
Because we do not manufacture complete commercial vehicles, we are dependent on commercial vehicle OEMs to provide de-contended chassis (chassis with conventional powertrain components removed) platforms for installing our electrified powertrain solutions. The most favorable financial model for deployment of our products is for OEMs to directly install our products in their commercial vehicles when they are being assembled. If OEMs are unable or unwilling to integrate the installation of our electrified powertrain solutions into their commercial vehicle production lines, we may have to establish other OEM relationships or rely on commercial truck upfitting and modification companies to do this work. To the extent that there are limitations on the availability of de-contented chassis, either due to the unwillingness or inability of OEMs and producers to produce and provide them to us or our installation partners, or a change in governmental regulations or policies, we would either need to develop our own commercial vehicle on which to install our electrified powertrain solutions or install our products into commercial vehicles that would have to be de-contented. Either case could have a negative impact on our ability to sell our electrified powertrain solutions at the prices, margins, or in the timeframes that we anticipate. Additionally, if commercial vehicle OEMs limit or fail to provide a warranty on vehicles with our electrified powertrain solutions, we will incur additional costs by contracting with a third party to provide warranty services. Any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We will rely on third parties, including commercial truck upfitting and modification companies and commercial vehicle OEMs, to install our electrified powertrain solutions in vehicles, which is subject to risks.
We intend to enter into agreements with commercial truck upfitting and modification companies and commercial vehicle OEMs to install our electrified powertrain solutions. Using third-party contract manufacturers and installers for the production and installation of our electrified powertrain solutions is subject to risks with respect to operations that are outside our control. We 
could experience delays if our outsourcing partners do not meet agreed upon timelines or experience capacity constraints that make it impossible for us to fulfill purchase orders on time or at all. The installation of our solutions may also void the warranty of a vehicle or a vehicle’s components, such as the engine or transmission, which may reduce customer demand for our solutions. Our ability to successfully build a premium brand could also be adversely affected by perceptions about the quality of our outsourcing partners’ products. In addition, although we are involved in each step of the supply chain, production and installation processes, because we also rely on our outsourcing partners and third parties to meet our quality standards, there can be no assurance that the final product will meet expected quality standards.
We are dependent on our suppliers, some of which are single or limited-source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our vehicles at prices, volumes, and performance specifications acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We rely on third-party suppliers, some of whom are single-source suppliers, for the provision and development of many of the key components and materials used in our electrified powertrain solutions, such as natural gas generators. Any failure of these suppliers or outsourcing partners to perform could require us to seek alternative suppliers or to expand our production capabilities, which could incur additional costs and have a negative impact on our cost or supply of components or finished goods. While we plan to obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, some of the components used in our vehicles will be purchased by us from a single source. Our third-party suppliers may not be able to meet their product specifications and performance characteristics or our desired specifications, performance and pricing, which would impact our ability to achieve our product specifications and performance characteristics as well. Additionally, our third-party suppliers may be unable to obtain required certifications for their products for which we plan to use or provide warranties that are necessary for our solutions. If we are unable to obtain components and materials used in our electrified powertrain solutions from our suppliers or if our suppliers decide to create or supply a competing product, our business could be adversely affected. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term (or at all) at prices or quality levels that are favorable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of our components, particularly battery cells, could harm our business. 
Once we begin commercial production of our electrified powertrain solutions, we may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of our components. Any such increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The prices for our components fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Any disruption in the supply of battery cells could temporarily disrupt production of our electrified powertrain solutions until a different supplier is fully qualified. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers if they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges. Substantial increases in the prices for raw materials may increase the cost of our components and consequently, the costs of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of our components by increasing prices, which could reduce our margins.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Competitive Landscape
Our future growth is dependent upon the commercial trucking industry’s willingness to adopt alternative fuel, hybrid and electric vehicles.
Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption of alternative fuel, hybrid and electric vehicles by the commercial trucking industry. If the market for alternative fuel, hybrid and electric vehicles and our electrified powertrain solutions does not develop at the rate or in the manner or to the extent that we expect, or if critical assumptions we have made regarding the efficiency, range or performance of our electrified powertrain solutions are incorrect or incomplete, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuels, hybrid and electric vehicles is new and untested and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, numerous competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards and uncertain customer demands and behaviors.
Although we hope to be among the first to bring electrified powertrain solutions to market, competitors have already begun to sell electrified vehicles and may gain a competitive advantage over us.
We face intense competition in trying to be among the first to bring electrified powertrain solutions to market, and we expect competition to intensify in light of increased demand and regulatory push for alternative fuel and electric vehicles. Most of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do. They may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their alternative fuel and electric truck programs. Additionally, our competitors also have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships and other resources than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our 
products. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. We cannot provide assurances that our electrified systems will be the first to market and there are no assurances that customers will choose vehicles with our electrified systems over those of our competitors, or over diesel powered trucks.
Numerous companies including Cummins, Daimler, Dana, Navistar, PACCAR, Volvo, Tesla, Nikola, Lion Electric, Hyzon and other commercial vehicle manufacturers have announced their plans to bring Class 8 semi-truck BEVs or FCEVs to the market. Furthermore, we will also face competition from manufacturers of internal combustion engines powered by diesel fuel and natural gas. We expect additional competitors to enter the industry as well.
Developments in alternative technology or improvements in the internal combustion engine may adversely affect the demand for our electrified powertrain solutions.
Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as battery cells, advanced diesel, improved natural gas engines, new power generation technology or alternate fuel sources or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results in ways we do not currently anticipate. Existing and other battery cell technologies, fuels or sources of energy may emerge as customers’ preferred alternative to our electrified powertrain solutions. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced alternative fuel and electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our electrified powertrain solutions, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in alternative fuel and electric vehicle technology.
Risks Related to Technology, Data and Privacy-Related Matters
We are subject to cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, infrastructure, integrated software in our electrified powertrain solutions and customer data processed by us or third-party vendors or suppliers and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.
We collect, store, transmit and otherwise process customer, driver, employee and others’ data as part of our business operations, which may include personal data or confidential or proprietary information. We also work with partners and third-party service providers or vendors that collect, store and process such data on our behalf in connection with our business. There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers or vendors have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats.
We are at risk for interruptions, outages and breaches of: (a) operational systems; (b) facility security systems; (c) transmission control modules or other in-product technology; in each case owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers as well as (a) the integrated software in our electrified powertrain solutions; or (b) customer or driver data that we process or our third-party vendors or suppliers process on our behalf. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we maintain information technology measures designed to protect ourselves against intellectual property theft, data breaches and other cyber incidents, we cannot be sure that these systems upon which we rely, including those of our third-party vendors or suppliers, will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned. If these systems do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. Moreover, our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated. A significant cyber incident could impact production capability, harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, any of which could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 
Any unauthorized control or manipulation of the information technology systems in our electrified powertrain solutions could result in loss of confidence in us and our electrified powertrain solutions and harm our business.
Our electrified powertrain solutions contain complex information technology systems and built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates to improve or update functionality. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our electrified powertrain solutions and related systems. Any unauthorized access to or control of our electrified powertrain solutions, or any loss of customer data, could result in legal claims or proceedings and remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital expenditures. 
Inability to leverage vehicle and customer data could impact our software algorithms and impact research and development operations.
We rely on data collected from the use of fleet vehicles outfitted with our products, including vehicle data and data related to battery usage statistics. We use this data in connection with our software algorithms and the research, development and analysis 
of our products. Our inability to obtain this data or the necessary rights to use this data could result in delays or otherwise negatively impact our research and development efforts.
We may need to defend ourselves against patent, copyright or trademark infringement claims or trade secret misappropriation claims, which may be time-consuming and cause us to incur substantial costs.
Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may own or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent or limit our ability to make, use, develop or sell our electrified powertrain solutions, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. We may receive inquiries from patent, copyright or trademark owners inquiring whether we infringe upon their proprietary rights. We may also be the subject of allegations that we have misappropriated their trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs, electric motors, fuel cells or electronic power management systems may allege infringement or misappropriation of such rights. In response to a determination that we have infringed upon or misappropriated a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to (a) cease development, sales or use of our products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property, (b) pay substantial damages, (c) obtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or (d) redesign one or more aspects or systems of our electrified powertrain solutions. A successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Any litigation or claims, whether valid or invalid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.
Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties.
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our rights in our technology; however, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective.
Patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws vary throughout the world. Some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Further, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions may be difficult. Therefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the U.S.
Also, while we have registered trademarks in an effort to protect our investment in our brand and goodwill with customers, competitors may challenge the validity of those trademarks and other brand names in which we have invested. Such challenges can be expensive and may adversely affect our ability to maintain the goodwill gained in connection with a particular trademark.
Risks Related to Environmental and Regulatory Matters
The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives for alternative fuel use due to policy changes or government regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle industry or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel and electric vehicle industry generally or our electrified powertrain solutions. While certain tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy production, alternative fuel and electric vehicles have been available in the past, there is no guarantee these programs will be available in the future. In particular, we are influenced by federal, state and local tax credits, rebates, grants and other government programs and incentives that promote the use of RNG and natural gas as vehicle fuel. These include various government programs that make grant funds available for the purchase of natural gas vehicles or encourage low carbon “compliant” transportation fuels (including CNG). If current tax incentives are not available in the future, our financial position could be harmed.
Additionally, other changes to governmental regulations and policies could impact the competitiveness of natural gas as a fuel source. For instance, a limitation or ban on extraction methods like fracking, could have a negative impact on the availability and price of natural gas and may adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets. Additionally, an increase in the economic incentives for other fuel sources or BEVs, such as through the subsidization of other fuel sources or higher permitted weight limits for BEVs or FCEVs or the reduction or elimination of the higher permitted weight limits for 
natural gas vehicles, could make our products less competitive. Such changes in regulations and policies could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Our business could be negatively affected by unfavorable changes to federal or state tax laws or the adoption of federal or state laws or regulations mandating new or additional limits on the production of GHG emissions, the cost of natural gas and “tailpipe” emissions.
Federal or state laws or regulations may be adopted that would impose new or additional limits on the emissions of GHG. The potential effects of GHG emission limits on our business are subject to significant uncertainties based on, among other things, the timing of the implementation of any new requirements, the required levels of emission reductions, the nature of any market-based or tax-based mechanisms adopted to facilitate reductions, the relative availability of GHG emission reduction offsets, the development of cost-effective, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulations and liability mitigation measures, the range of available compliance alternatives, and our ability to demonstrate that our products qualify as a compliance alternative under any new statutory or regulatory programs to limit GHG emissions. If our solutions are not able to meet future GHG emission limits or perform as well as BEV, FCEV or other alternative fuel vehicles, for instance due to unavailability of RNG in a particular area, a decline in RNG production, an increase in RNG cost, a decrease in credits for RNG or an increase in our cost, our solutions could be less competitive. Additionally, federal, state or road taxes could be added to natural gas fuel, which would increase the operating cost of our products. Furthermore, additional federal or state taxes could be implemented on “tailpipe” emissions, which would have a negative impact on the cost of our products and a positive impact on the cost of BEVs and FCEVs relative to our solutions. Such new federal or state laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We, our outsourcing partners and our suppliers are or may be subject to substantial regulation and unfavorable changes to, or failure by us, our outsourcing partners or our suppliers to comply with, these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.
Our electrified powertrain solutions, and the sale of motor vehicles in general, our outsourcing partners and our suppliers are or may be subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state and local laws. We continue to evaluate requirements for licenses, approvals, certificates and governmental authorizations necessary to manufacture, sell or service our electrified powertrain solutions in the jurisdictions in which we plan to operate and intend to take such actions necessary to comply. We may experience difficulties in obtaining or complying with various licenses, approvals, certifications and other governmental authorizations necessary to manufacture, sell or service their electrified powertrain solutions in any of these jurisdictions. If we, our outsourcing partners or our suppliers are unable to obtain or comply with any of the licenses, approvals, certifications or other governmental authorizations necessary to carry out our operations in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate, or those jurisdictions in which we plan to operate in the future, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We expect to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. For example, if the battery packs installed in our electrified powertrain solutions are deemed to be transported, we will need to comply with the mandatory regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods,” and any deficiency in compliance may result in us being prohibited from selling our electrified powertrain solutions until compliant batteries are installed. Additionally, although we do not believe that our current after-market Hybrid system is required to obtain certifications from the EPA in the event that regulators determine that certifications are necessary, we may be prohibited from selling our Hybrid system until such time as we obtain the required certifications. Any such required changes to our battery packs or Hybrid system will require additional expenditures and may delay the shipment of vehicles. In addition, regulations related to the electric and alternative energy vehicle industry are evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations.
To the extent the laws change, our electrified powertrain solutions and our suppliers’ products may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.
We are subject to evolving laws, regulations, standards and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our reputation, subject us to significant fines and liability or adversely affect our business.
We intend to use our in-vehicle services and functionality to log information about each vehicle’s use in order to aid us in vehicle diagnostics and servicing. Our customers or their drivers may object to the use of this data, which may increase our vehicle maintenance costs and harm our business prospects. Collection of our customers’, employees’ and others’ information in conducting our business may subject us to various legislative and regulatory burdens related to data privacy and security that could require notification of data breaches, restrict our use of such information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers. The regulatory framework for data privacy and security is rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in a timely manner. For example, California requires connected devices to maintain minimum information security requirements. As legislation continues to develop, we will likely be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures and internal processes to comply with such legislation. In addition, non-compliance with these laws or a significant breach of our third-party service providers’ or 
vendors’ or our own network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand.
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our production facilities.
Our operations are and will be subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we have limited experience complying with them. Moreover, we expect that we will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury, fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third-party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.
Contamination at properties we will own or operate, we formerly owned or operated or to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining the required permits and approvals in connection with our planned production facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Risks Related to Capital and Tax Matters 
We may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.
The design, production, sale and servicing of our electrified powertrain solutions is capital-intensive. On October 1, 2020, the Company raised net proceeds of $516.5 million. At December 31, 2020, all outstanding warrants were either exercised or redeemed, with gross proceeds of $140.8 million raised, of which $16.3 million was collected during the first quarter of 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company had total equity of $423.6 million, inclusive of cash and cash equivalents of $119.5 million and total investments of $302.3 million. We may determine that additional funds are necessary earlier than anticipated. This capital may be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research, development and design efforts, create new products and improve infrastructure. We may raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited as a result of ownership changes.
We have incurred losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, if at all. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $229.5 million.
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act.
Under Section 382 of the Code, substantial changes in our ownership may result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized in the future to offset our taxable income. Generally, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period. We have completed such analysis and determined that such an ownership change occurred in 2017. This will limit the usage of our 2017 and prior year net operating losses, and will cause $2.0 million of such losses to expire unused, regardless of future taxable income. No other such ownership changes have occurred through December 31, 2022. Due to this, as well as our overall profitability estimate as 
noted above, we have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.
We may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we may apply. As a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.
We anticipate applying for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of alternative fuel and electric vehicles and related technologies. We anticipate that in the future there will be new opportunities for us to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from federal, state and foreign governments. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives will likely be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities
Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.
As of December 31, 2022, our executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates, as a group, beneficially owned approximately 22.2% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.
We may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plans. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.
We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plans. Any such issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock may cause significant dilution, subordinate the rights to holders of common stock to those of preferred stock, cause a change in control, and adversely affect prevailing market prices.
General Risks
Future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Any product recall in the future, whether it involves us or a competitor’s product, may result in negative publicity, damage our brand and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our products (including the batteries we design, develop and manufacture) prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards or other laws or regulations. Such recalls may involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Since early 2020, there have been periods of widespread worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Numerous government regulations and public advisories, as well as shifting social behaviors, temporarily limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. Reduced operations and production line shutdowns at commercial vehicle OEMs due to COVID-19, limitations on travel by our personnel and personnel of our customers and increased demand for commercial trucks within our customers’ fleets caused a delay to the planned installation of our Hybrid system on their trucks. A resurgence of COVID-19 and related variants could result in similar restrictions to normal business activity in the future and cause delays or shutdowns of commercial vehicle OEMs or our suppliers that could impact our ability to meet customer orders.
We are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions and may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.
We have entered into strategic alliances and may in the future enter into additional strategic alliances or joint ventures or minority equity investments, in each case with various third parties for the production of our electrified powertrain solutions as well as with other collaborators with capabilities on data and analytics, engineering, installation channels, refueling stations and hydrogen fuel cells. These alliances subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. Strategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of our business. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to continue to identify or secure suitable business 
relationship opportunities in the future or our competitors may capitalize on such opportunities before we do. Moreover, identifying such opportunities could require substantial management time and resources, and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
When appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our existing business. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to do so. Furthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant.
