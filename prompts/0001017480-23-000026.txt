Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Hibbett, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, is a leading athletic-inspired fashion retailer with over 1,100 stores under the Hibbett, City Gear and Sports Additions banners, primarily located in underserved communities. Founded in 1945, Hibbett has a rich history of convenient locations, personalized customer service and access to coveted footwear, apparel and equipment from top brands like Nike, Jordan and adidas.
Our Business Strategy
We target underserved markets with branded products and provide a high level of customer service. This market strategy establishes greater customer, vendor and landlord recognition as a leading specialty retailer in these communities. We believe our ability to align our merchandising mix to local preferences and trends differentiates us from our national competitors and delivers incremental sales opportunities for our vendor partners. We use information systems to maintain tight controls over inventory and operating costs and continually search for ways to improve efficiencies and the customer experience through information system upgrades.

Our Store Brands
We operated the following store brands as of January 28, 2023:

 | | Location 
Brand | Average Square Footage | Strip Center(1) | Mall | Total
Hibbett | 5,800 | 754 | | 178 | 932
City Gear | 5,200 | 148 | | 37 | 185
Sports Additions(2) | 2,900 | 3 | | 13 | 16 

(1) Strip centers include free-standing stores and, for our Hibbett locations, are usually near a major chain retailer.
(2) Approximately 90% of the merchandise carried in our Sports Additions stores is athletic footwear.
In selecting retail locations, we consider the size, demographics, quality of real estate and competitive conditions in each market. Our stores offer a core merchandising mix of premium athletic branded footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment designed to appeal to the Gen Z customers within each market. We strive to meet the fashion and technical demands of our customers.
Our Growth Strategy
We identify markets for our stores under a clustered expansion program. This approach primarily focuses on opening new stores within close proximity of existing locations, allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies in logistics, marketing and regional management. It also aids us in building a better understanding of appropriate merchandise selection for the local market. In addition to proximity to existing stores, we also consider population, economic conditions, local competitive dynamics, availability of suitable real estate and potential for return on investment when evaluating potential markets.
We recognize that even though our core customer is in underserved markets, they are digitally savvy. Our customer has high expectations that are constantly evolving including the ability to engage with us in multiple ways. As a result, we continue to make investments in omni-channel as well as our core e-commerce experience. 
Our goal is to provide a frictionless digital and omni-channel experience. In Fiscal 2024, we expect to continue to invest in next generation mobile omni-channel capabilities that mitigate perennial pain points for our store employees and customers.
Our Logistics
We maintain a full-line wholesale and logistics facility in Alabaster, Alabama (a suburb of Birmingham) where we receive and ship most of our merchandise. In addition, we utilize a third-party logistics facility in Memphis, Tennessee to increase efficiencies and to improve time to market. For key products, we maintain backstock at the Alabaster and Memphis facilities. This product is allocated and shipped to stores through an automatic replenishment system based on inventory levels and sales. Merchandise is delivered to stores, and transferred between stores, via small package carriers, Company operated vehicles or third-party logistics providers (which also deliver initial new store inventories). We believe strong logistics support for our stores is a critical element of our business strategy and that our current logistics structure will support our growth over the next several years.
Our Merchandise
Our merchandising strategy emphasizes a TOE-TO-HEAD® approach. We provide a broad assortment of premium brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment at competitive prices in a full service omni-channel environment. We believe that the assortment of brand name merchandise we offer consistently exceeds the merchandise selection carried by most of our competitors, particularly in our underserved markets and neighborhood centers. Many of these brand name products have limited availability and/or are technical in nature requiring considerable sales assistance. We coordinate with our vendors to educate the sales staff at the store level on new products and trends.
Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each store, it is somewhat differentiated by the Hibbett or City Gear brands. Each brand utilizes important demographic, local and/or regional considerations. Accordingly, we offer products that reflect preferences for particular demographics as well as interests from each community. Our knowledge of these interests, combined with access to leading brands, enables our merchandising staff to react quickly to emerging trends or special events, such as fashion shifts or athletic events.

Index

Our merchandising staff, operations staff and management analyze current trends primarily through the lens of our store typing strategy. Information is largely gathered and analyzed utilizing business intelligence tools. Other strategic measures we utilize to recognize trends or changes in our industry include:
•maintaining close relationships with vendors and other retailers;
•studying other retailers for best practices in merchandising;
•attending various trade shows, both in our industry and outside as well as reviewing industry trade publications; and
•actively participating in industry associations.
The merchandising staff works closely with store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities.
Our Vendor Relationships
The athletic specialty and city specialty retail businesses are brand-name-driven. Accordingly, we maintain positive relationships with a number of well-known vendors to satisfy customer demand. We believe that we offer a best-in-class omni-channel experience through physical locations, mobile apps and website and that we are among the primary retail distribution avenues for brand name vendors that seek to engage with consumers in underserved markets. As a result, we are able to attract considerable vendor interest and establish long-term partnerships with vendors. As our vendors expand their product lines and grow in popularity, we expand sales of these products. In addition, as we continue to increase our store base and enter new markets, our vendors increase their brand presence within these regions. We also work with our vendors to establish favorable pricing and to receive cooperative marketing funds.
Our Information Systems
We use technology as an enabler of our business strategies. We implement and maintain systems targeted at improving inventory control, merchandise planning, logistics, replenishment, product allocation, financial control and cost management. Our systems are designed to be flexible to meet the unique needs of each specific store location. We continue to evolve our digital channel experience and to develop further channel integration for a more seamless and frictionless set of capabilities aimed at enhancing our customer's shopping experience in-store, online and through our mobile solutions.
Our communications networks send and receive critical business data to and from stores, third-party cloud providers and managed hosting facilities (data centers). Our Company’s information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cyber-security threats and business interruptions by maintaining strong security protocols, threat monitoring, risk reviews, cyber tabletop exercises, employee awareness training and a detailed disaster recovery plan. In Fiscal 2022, we consolidated our Human Capital Management, Payroll, Finance and Accounting systems into Workday’s enterprise cloud platform, which allowed us to eliminate numerous disparate solutions in our effort to streamline processes, improve control over sensitive data and become more well-managed and scalable as an organization.
We strive to maintain highly qualified and motivated third-party partners and teams of individuals to support our information systems, which include information security, compliance, quality assurance, computer operations, help desk, network and platform engineering, business analysis, solution development, analytics and project management. Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day, and management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will continue to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information system planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning and enterprise risk management. Information systems projects are prioritized based on strategic, financial, regulatory and other business criteria.
Our Marketing and Promotion
Our target customer is Gen Z, therefore our marketing efforts are focused on acquiring and retaining Gen Z customers. As such, we have invested in and expanded our digital marketing capabilities and our hyperlocal marketing efforts that help us connect with our communities.
Our loyalty program represented over half of overall sales in Fiscal 2023 as a result of improvements to the loyalty program which drove member acquisition and retention. E-commerce sales continued to increase year-over-year, driven by the increase in members, as well as an increase in average purchase amounts.

Our Competition
The business in which we are engaged is highly competitive. The marketplace for athletic specialty merchandise is highly fragmented as many different brick and mortar and online retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of formats and merchandising strategies. We compete with specialty shoe stores, department stores, traditional shoe stores, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and, in some of our large and mid-size markets, national sporting goods superstores. In addition, we face competition from vendors that sell directly to consumers.
Although we face competition from a variety of competitors, we believe that our stores are able to compete effectively by providing a premium assortment of footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment. Additionally, we differentiate our store experience through extensive product knowledge, customer service and convenient locations. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors in the underserved markets and neighborhood centers predominantly in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States.

Human Capital
Human Capital Management
Central to our long-term strategy is attracting, developing, and retaining high-quality employees. This is crucial to all aspects of our business and is a key driver of our long-term success. This process begins by providing competitive wages and benefits in a positive work environment where we focus on doing what is right. In many cases, employment at a Hibbett or City Gear store represents our employees’ first job experience. We believe these individuals are attracted to our stores because they are consumers who appreciate our customer service, our compelling assortment of product and our best-in-class digital experience. Starting with their first day, new employees are exposed to our corporate culture of responsibility, respect and customer service. As an employee gains experience and demonstrates an understanding and commitment to our core principles, promotional opportunities are readily available. As a result, a large number of our store managers started out as part-time sales associates and we take great pride in providing career advancement opportunities for so many people.
We are committed to providing competitive wages in the markets we serve. Enhancing the financial stability of our team members is a priority, and we continually look for ways to improve our efforts in this area, including our partnering with a third-party vendor to provide an early access to pay feature, which allows our employees to get paid when they need it instead of waiting until a predetermined pay day, increasing our employee discount, and offering financial wellness classes to our team members at the Store Support Center.

Helping our employees in need is important to us, and we have an established employee charitable foundation that allows employees to apply for assistance in a dignified and private manner. We offer an Education Assistance Tuition Reimbursement Program for our Store Support Center and logistics facility team members. 
As of January 28, 2023, we employed over 11,000 team members, of which approximately 3,800 were full-time team members and over 94% of the total population work in our retail locations. None of our team members are represented by a labor union. The number of full-time and part-time team members fluctuates depending on seasonal needs. We have a long history of providing competitive compensation and benefits and providing meaningful experiences and career-development opportunities to our team members. As a result, we have not experienced significant interruptions in our operations due to labor disagreements or team member dissatisfaction. 
Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement:
Our philosophy is simple; be inclusive and treat each other with respect. As a result of our ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we have built a winning team comprised of diverse, compassionate and competitive individuals. We have cultivated an authentic representation of our communities through thoughtful local hiring, often from our customer base and the communities we serve. Our teams' unique backgrounds, perspectives and skills improve us all, creating a competitive advantage that positively impacts our business and contributes to our success.
We partner with the University of Alabama at Birmingham's office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion to provide education and training to our team members and Board of Directors on this important topic. The mission of our Women's Resource Group, Ignite, is to cultivate a sense of belonging in a space that supports and encourages all women to develop and further their potential through collaboration, connection and conversation.
We fully believe that our differences make us stronger, and we are relentless in creating a work environment that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion. We were named one of the "Best Employers for Diversity" by Forbes in 2022. 
Talent Acquisition/Talent Development/Team Member Engagement
Investing in our team members is one of our core strategies. We strive to offer best-in-class training and development opportunities, while creating innovative programs that enable a vibrant and engaged learning culture to flourish. In addition to our tuition reimbursement program, we utilize the LinkedIn Learning platform, offer a Leadership Academy, and provide a professional development series consisting of monthly educational sessions for leadership positions at our Store Support Center. Additionally, as part of our tuition reimbursement program, we partner with Bellevue University to offer online classes for employees.
We recognize that maintaining an inclusive and high-performance culture requires an engaged workforce, where team members are motivated to do their best work every day. Our engagement approach centers on communication and recognition. We communicate with our team members in a variety of ways, including monthly live CEO updates that include Q&A sessions with team members and regular communications to all our retail locations. We conduct periodic team member engagement surveys at our Store Support Center to understand and respond to team member needs. In February 2022, we expanded our annual survey Company-wide to provide all team members a channel for feedback on a variety of topics, including Company direction and strategy, individual growth and development, collaboration, confidence, and meaningful work. Mental and emotional health is a priority now more than ever. We provide our team members with free access to mental health assistance, including marital, grief and financial counseling.
Community and Social Impact - Building Connections
We take pride in and share a sense of responsibility with our communities. We reflect the diversity of the communities we serve and strengthen our connectivity through local events and social programs. We believe it is important to invest in our youth and give back to the communities we serve in a meaningful and impactful way. During Fiscal 2023, we hosted over 1,100 hyperlocal events resulting in hundreds of volunteers and hundreds of communities impacted with lives changed for the better. 
SOLE SCHOOL® is the main focus for community engagement in our local retail districts. In Fiscal 2023, in total and in conjunction with Nike, we provided funds and merchandise to 94 schools across 36 states to help support education and athletics. As part of the SOLE SCHOOL® program, sponsored schools receive a financial gift, donations of equipment, footwear and backpacks, and interested students are given the opportunity to be mentored by local store management staff.

In Fiscal 2023, we partnered with Jordan Brand to support For Oak Cliff, a non-profit organization based in Dallas, TX, donating product for the Annual Back To School Infinity Festival and financial funding assistance for a new Multimedia Lab. Also during Fiscal 2023, we launched a Fresh Off the Block video series in conjunction with Nike which takes viewers to a new city to explore the local music scene, basketball, personal style and the neighborhoods behind the city's heartbeat. 
We are a long-term partner of United Way of Central Alabama and Children's Hospital of Alabama.

Environmental Sustainability
We strive to act in the interest of our team members, customers, communities and stockholders by supporting environmentally sustainable practices. We understand the important role that everyone must play in reducing their environmental impact, which is why we have retained a third-party vendor to measure our energy and water usage since early 2022. In FY2023, Hibbett underwent a comprehensive materiality assessment conducted by a third-party accounting and advisory services firm. This assessment was conducted to learn more about ESG expectations from the perspective of different stakeholders. Customers, investors, vendor partners and internal management were interviewed and/or participated in surveys to identify key topics of focus to be considered in future ESG strategy.
Example initiatives we are undertaking include:
•package size efficiency optimization efforts designed to ensure that shipping cartons are packed full to avoid shipping air by utilizing route optimization software for our local delivery drivers;
•energy reduction initiatives which include store and Store Support Center LED lighting, LED signage and HVAC unit replacements with energy efficient models;
•sustainability efforts and recycling programs to divert waste from landfills by using shipping boxes and shopping bags that incorporate recyclable material, re-using cartons and pallets in our logistics facility, re-using clothes hangers and sensor tags in our stores, and utilizing environmentally friendly office supply products where possible; and 
•collaboration with certain vendors to offer sustainable products such as support of Nike's Move to Zero®, a closed-loop process that uses manufacturing scrap, unsellable products, and worn-out shoes to make new products, by significant marketing and social media effort and in-store displays, as well as offering other sustainable products from a number of other vendors including the adidas Parley collection of footwear and apparel partly made with recycled ocean plastic and The North Face products made with recycled polyester and nylon.
