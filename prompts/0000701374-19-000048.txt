ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Introduction
We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world and the largest operator of waterparks in North America based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 25 regional theme parks and waterparks, 22 are located in the United States, two are located in Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our U.S. parks serve each of the top 10 designated market areas, as determined by a survey of television households within designated market areas published by A.C. Nielsen Media Research in September 2018. Our diversified portfolio of North American parks serves an aggregate population of approximately 130 million people and 230 million people within a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles, respectively, with some of the highest per capita gross domestic product in the U.S.
Our parks occupy approximately 5,900 acres of land, and we own approximately 800 acres of other potentially developable land. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America. Our parks generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, and thereby provide a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. In the aggregate, during 2018, our parks offered approximately 920 rides, including over 150 roller coasters, making us the leading provider of "thrill rides" in the industry.
In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ("Former SFEC", a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that had always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks and waterparks under the Six Flags name for nearly forty years and established an internationally recognized brand name. We own the "Six Flags" brand name in the U.S. and foreign countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, 21 of our parks are branded as "Six Flags" or "Hurricane Harbor" parks and, in 2014, we also began the development, with third-party partners, of Six Flags-branded parks outside of North America.
We hold exclusive long-term licenses for theme park usage of certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters throughout the U.S. (except the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and other countries. These characters include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam, Batman, Superman, The Joker, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and others. We use these characters to market our parks and to provide an enhanced family entertainment experience. Our licenses include the right to sell merchandise featuring the characters at the parks, and to use the characters in our advertising, as walk-around characters and in theming for rides, attractions and retail outlets. We believe using these characters promotes increased attendance, supports higher ticket prices, increases lengths-of-stay and enhances in-park sales.
We believe our parks benefit from limited direct theme park competition. A limited supply of real estate appropriate for theme park development, substantial initial capital investment requirements, long development lead-time, and zoning restrictions provide each of our parks with a significant degree of protection from competitive new theme park openings. Based on our knowledge of the development of our own and other regional theme parks, we estimate it would cost $500 million to $700 million and would take a minimum of four years to construct a new regional theme park comparable to one of our major Six Flags-branded theme parks.
Description of Parks and Segment Information
Our parks provide similar products and services through a similar process to the same class of customer through a consistent method. We also believe our parks share common economic characteristics. Based on these factors, we have only one reportable segment—theme parks. The following chart summarizes key business and geographical information about our parks.

Partnership Park Arrangements
In connection with our 1998 acquisition of Former SFEC, we guaranteed certain obligations relating to Six Flags Over Texas ("SFOT") and Six Flags Over Georgia, including Six Flags White Water Atlanta ("SFOG", and together with SFOT, the "Partnership Parks"). These obligations continue until 2027, in the case of SFOG, and 2028, in the case of SFOT. Such obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately $72.5 million in 2019 (subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners in the Partnerships Parks (based on our ownership of units as of December 31, 2018, our share of the distribution will be approximately $31.7 million) and (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five-year periods based generally on 6% of Partnership Park revenues. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the "Partnership Park Put"). 
After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3% of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears, then repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans, with any additional cash being distributed 95% to us, in the case of SFOG, and 92.5% to us, in the case of SFOT.
The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the "Specified Price") that is the greater of (i) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park's weighted average four year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple (8.0 in the case of SFOG and 8.5 in the case of SFOT) and (ii) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities.  Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of December 31, 2018, is $408.3 million in the case of SFOG and $520.5 million in the case of SFOT. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 31.0% and 53.2% of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. The remaining redeemable units of approximately 69.0% and 46.8% of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately $525.3 million. 
Pursuant to the 2018 annual offer, we did not purchase any units from the Georgia partnership and we purchased 0.1750 units from the Texas partnership for approximately $0.4 million in May 2018. The $350 million accordion feature on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (as defined in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7 of this Annual Report) is available for borrowing for future "put" obligations if necessary.
In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company's entities, Time Warner and an affiliate of Time Warner, pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations which own the entities that have purchased and will purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities. 
We incurred $21.2 million of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2018 season and intend to incur approximately $17 million of capital expenditures at these parks for the 2019 season, an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements before any funds are required from us. The two partnerships generated approximately $77.6 million of cash in 2018 from operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to Holdings, as the case may be. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had total loans receivable outstanding of $239.3 million from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks. The proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners in prior years.

Marketing and Promotion
We attract visitors through multi-media marketing and promotional programs for each of our parks. The programs are designed to attract guests and enhance the Six Flags brand name and are tailored to address the different characteristics of our various markets and to maximize the impact of specific park attractions and product introductions. All marketing and promotional programs are updated or completely changed each year to address new developments. These initiatives are supervised by our Senior Vice President, Marketing and Sales, with the assistance of our senior management and advertising and promotion agencies.
We also develop alliance, sponsorship and co-marketing relationships with well-known national, regional and local consumer goods companies and retailers to supplement our advertising efforts and to provide attendance incentives in the form of discounts. We also arrange for popular local radio and television programs to be filmed or broadcast live from our parks.
During 2013, we launched a monthly membership program. During 2018, we enhanced the membership program by offering four premium priced tiers with enhanced benefits and launched a membership loyalty program, which entitles certain members to earn points that may be redeemed for park-related rewards. Membership and season pass sales establish an attendance base in advance of the season, reducing exposure to inclement weather and providing other benefits. In general, a season pass holder or member contributes higher aggregate revenue and profitability to the Company over the course of a year compared to a single day ticket guest because a season pass holder or member pays a higher ticket price and contributes to in-park guest spending over multiple visits. Additionally, guests enrolled in our membership program and season pass holders often bring paying guests and generate "word-of-mouth" advertising for the parks. Season pass and membership attendance constituted approximately 63% in both 2018 and 2017 and 60% in 2016 of the total attendance at our parks.
At times we offer discounts on season passes, multi-visit tickets, tickets for specific dates and tickets to affiliated groups such as businesses, schools and religious, fraternal and similar organizations.
We also implement promotional programs as a means of targeting specific market segments and locations not generally reached through group or retail sales efforts. The promotional programs utilize coupons, sweepstakes, reward incentives and rebates to attract additional visitors. These programs are implemented through online promotions, direct mail, telemarketing, direct-response media, sponsorship marketing and targeted multi-media programs. The special promotional offers are usually available for a limited time and offer a reduced admission price or provide some additional incentive to purchase a ticket.
Licenses
We have the exclusive right on a long-term basis to theme park usage of the Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters throughout the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and certain other countries. In particular, our license agreements entitle us to use, subject to customary approval rights of Warner Bros. and, in limited circumstances, approval rights of certain third parties, all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license, including Batman, The Joker, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam. They also include the right to sell merchandise using the characters. In addition to annual license fees, we are required to pay a royalty fee on any merchandise manufactured by or for us and sold that use the licensed characters. Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the license agreements under certain circumstances, including if any persons involved in the movie or television industries obtain control of us or, in the case of Warner Bros., upon a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.
Park Operations
We currently operate in geographically diverse markets in North America. The parks are generally managed by a park president who reports to a senior vice president of the Company. The park presidents are responsible for all operations and management of the individual parks. Local advertising, ticket sales, community relations and hiring and training of personnel are the responsibility of individual park management in coordination with corporate support teams.
Each park president directs a full-time, on-site management team. Each management team includes senior personnel responsible for operations and maintenance; in-park food, beverage, merchandising and games; marketing and promotion; sponsorships; human resources and finance. Finance directors at our parks report to a corporate senior vice president of the Company, and, with their support staff, provide financial services to their respective parks and park management teams. Park management compensation structures are designed to provide financial incentives for individual park managers to execute our strategy and to maximize revenue and free cash flow.
Our parks are generally open daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. In addition, most of our parks are open weekends prior to and following their daily seasons, often in conjunction with themed events such as Fright Fest® and Holiday in the Park®. Due to their location, certain parks have longer operating seasons. Typically, the parks charge a basic daily admission price that allows unlimited use of all rides and attractions, although in certain cases special rides and attractions 
5

require the payment of an additional fee. Our Six Flags Magic Mountain park operates 365 days a year and our parks in Mexico operate weekends year-round outside of their traditional operating season. Beginning in January 2019, our Six Flags Fiesta Texas park will operate weekends year-round outside of its traditional operating season.
See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning revenues and long-lived assets by domestic and international categories.
Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives
We regularly make capital investments, primarily for new rides and attractions in our parks, which total approximately 9% of revenues annually. We purchase both new and used rides and attractions. On occasion we also relocate rides among parks to provide fresh attractions. We believe the selective introduction of new rides and attractions, including family entertainment attractions, is an important factor in promoting each of the parks to draw higher attendance and encourage longer visits, which can lead to higher in-park sales.
During 2018, we (i) added the world’s first single rail coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas (San Antonio, TX); (ii) added the world’s tallest pendulum ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA); (iii) added a first-of-its-kind in North America, triple box spinning ride at Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ) and Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, TX); (iv) debuted Twisted Cyclone, a hybrid roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia (Austell, GA); (v) added a 70 miles-per-hour pendulum ride at Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA); (vi) added a 4D Free Fly Coaster at Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City); (vii) debuted an adventure river at Six Flags America (Largo, MD); (viii) added the world’s first-of-its-kind inverted coaster at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (Vallejo, CA); (ix) added the world’s largest loop coaster at Six Flags Great America (Gurnee, IL); (x) added a hybrid, zero-gravity slide complex at Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO); (xi) added a classic spinning attraction at The Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom (Queensbury, NY); (xii) added a new family thrill ride at La Ronde (Montreal, Canada); (xiii) debuted a new family interactive water play attraction at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Concord (Concord, CA); and (xiv) introduced five new domestic parks, Frontier City and Whitewater Bay (Oklahoma City, OK), Wet 'n' Wild Splashtown (Houston, TX), Wet 'n' Phoenix (Phoenix, AZ), and Darien Lake (Buffalo, NY). 
Planned initiatives for 2019 include (i) the world's first racing launch coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA); (ii) one of the world's largest pendulum rides at Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ); (iii) the fastest accelerating launch coaster in North America at Six Flags Great America (Gurnee, IL); (iv) a 4D Free Fly Coaster at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (Vallejo, CA); (v) the world's largest spinning pendulum ride at Six Flags Fiesta Texas (San Antonio, TX); (vi) a new family area with six brand new attractions at Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico) and a new racing slide at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oaxtepec (Oaxtepec, Mexico); (vii) the world's largest loop coaster at Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, Texas); (viii) a new dark ride attraction at Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA); (ix) a new kids area at Frontier City (Oklahoma City, OK); (x) the tallest swinging pendulum ride in the Southeast at Six Flags Over Georgia (Austell, GA); (xi) a loop coaster at La Ronde (Montreal, Canada); (xii) a new whirling wheel attraction at Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO); (xiii) two new family attractions and rebranding the waterpark to Hurricane Harbor at The Great Escape (Queensbury, NY); (xiv) new trains and theming for the Firebird coaster at Six Flags America (Largo, MD); (xv) a swing ride at Six Flags Darien Lake, the tallest thrill ride in New York, (Buffalo, NY); (xvi) a new six story wave wall slide at Hurricane Harbor Splashtown (Houston, TX); (xvii) rebranding Wet 'n' Wild Phoenix, Wet 'n' Wild Splashtown, and Darien Lake to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Phoenix, Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown, and Six Flags Darien Lake, respectively; and (xviii) introducing our twenty-sixth park with the acquisition of Magic Waters Waterpark (Rockport, IL).
In addition to new rides and attractions, we make other capital improvements. We generally make capital investments in the food, retail, games and other in-park areas to increase per capita guest spending. We also make annual enhancements in the theming and landscaping of our parks in order to provide a more complete family-oriented entertainment experience. Each year, we invest in our information technology infrastructure, which helps enhance our operational efficiencies. Maintenance capital expenditures are planned on an annual basis with most expenditures made during the off-season. Repairs and maintenance costs for materials and services associated with maintaining assets, such as painting and inspecting existing rides, are expensed as incurred and are not included in capital expenditures.
Also during 2019, we plan to continue (i) our targeted marketing strategies to attract guests, including focusing on our breadth of product and value offerings; (ii) improving and expanding upon our branded product offerings and guest-focused initiatives to continue driving guest spending growth, including membership and new loyalty reward programs and the all season dining pass program, which enables season pass holders and members to eat meals and snacks any day they visit the park for one upfront payment; and (iii) growing sponsorship and international revenue opportunities.
International Agreements
We have signed agreements to assist third parties in the development and management of Six Flags-branded parks outside of North America. As compensation for exclusivity, brand licensing rights, and design, development and management services, 
6

we receive fees during the design and development period as well as ongoing remuneration after the parks open to the public. The agreements do not require us to make any capital investments in the parks. We currently have agreements to develop Six Flags-branded parks in China, Saudi Arabia, and Dubai.
The development of a Six Flags-branded theme park in Dubai is currently on hold. Although our partner is current on all of its financial obligations to us, and while we intend to continue to work with them on a path forward, there can be no assurances as to the outcome of this project. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2018, some of the China parks' opening schedules were delayed due to recent macroeconomic events and their impact on our partner.
Maintenance and Inspection
Rides are inspected at various levels and frequencies in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Our rides are inspected daily during the operating season by our maintenance personnel. These inspections include safety checks, as well as regular maintenance, and are made through both visual inspection and test operations of the rides. Our senior management and the individual park personnel evaluate the risk aspects of each park's operations. Potential risks to employees and staff as well as to the public are evaluated. In addition, contingency response plans for potential emergency situations have been developed for each facility. During the off-season, maintenance personnel examine the rides and repair, refurbish and rebuild them when necessary. This process includes x-raying and magnafluxing (a further examination for minute cracks and defects) steel portions of certain rides at high-stress points. A large portion of our full-time workforce devotes substantially all of its time to maintaining the parks and our rides and attractions. We use a computerized maintenance-management system across all of our domestic parks to assist us in executing our maintenance programs.
In addition to the performance of our internal maintenance and inspection procedures, third-party consultants are retained by us or our insurance carriers to perform an annual inspection of each park and all attractions. The results of these inspections are reported in written evaluation and inspection reports and include suggestions on various aspects of park operations. In certain states, state inspectors conduct additional annual ride inspections before the beginning of each season. Other portions of each park are subject to inspections by local fire marshals and health and building department officials. Furthermore, we use Ellis & Associates as water safety consultants at all of our waterparks to train lifeguards and audit safety procedures.
Insurance
We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts we believe are commercially reasonable and are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to $100.0 million per occurrence. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.0 million, followed by a $0.5 million deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our parks in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our self-insured retention contingencies. For workers' compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is $0.75 million. We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million with a $0.25 million self-insured retention per event.
We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2019. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.
Competition
Our parks compete directly with other theme parks, water and amusement parks and indirectly with all other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment within their market areas, including movies, sporting events, home entertainment options, restaurants and vacation travel. Accordingly, our business is and will continue to be subject to factors affecting the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions and changes in discretionary consumer spending habits. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." Within each park's regional market area, the principal factors affecting direct theme park competition include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived safety and quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, the atmosphere and cleanliness of a park and the quality of its food and entertainment.
Seasonality
7

Our operations are highly seasonal, with approximately 75% of park attendance and revenues occurring in the second and third calendar quarters of each year, with the most significant period falling between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and aboveground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. In addition, our operations are subject to other local, state and federal governmental regulations including, without limitation, labor, health, safety, zoning and land use and minimum wage regulations applicable to theme park and waterpark operations, and local and state regulations applicable to restaurant operations at each park. Finally, certain of our facilities are subject to laws and regulations relating to the care of animals. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and, although no assurance can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future.
Portions of the undeveloped areas at certain of our parks are classified as wetlands. Accordingly, we may need to obtain governmental permits and other approvals prior to conducting development activities that affect these areas and future development may be prohibited in some or all of these areas. Additionally, the presence of wetlands in portions of our undeveloped land could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such land and/or the price we receive in any such disposition.
Philanthropy and Community Relations
We believe it is important to support the communities in which our parks are located. We partner with charitable organizations throughout North America whose mission aligns with our goal of bringing joy and thrills to families and children. Through our Read to Succeed program, we support academic achievement and seek to improve literacy by encouraging students to engage in recreational reading, and award free admission to eligible participants in the program. Most of our full-time employees spend at least an entire day each year volunteering on projects in their local communities to help others including distributing food to those in need, improving community centers and building or repairing homes. In addition, we sponsor toy drives, book drives, food drives and blood donation drives at our parks, and are committed to honoring the service of the U.S. military personnel and their families by offering complimentary and/or discounted admission to our parks.
