ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS

General Development of Business
 
Omnitek Engineering, Corp., a California corporation, began operations on October 10, 2001, and was a spin-off from Nology Engineering, Inc., a manufacturer in the automotive aftermarket parts industry and the developer/manufacturer of the patented “HotWires” spark plug wires. We currently conduct our business activities at our offices at 1333 Keystone Way, Suite 101, Vista, California, 92081, which consists of approximately 25,000 square feet of industrial space. 
 
Omnitek has never filed for bankruptcy and has never been subject to receivership or similar proceedings.
 
Omnitek’s common stock is currently trading on the OTC Bulletin Board (“OTCQB”) marketplace under the symbol OMTK.
 
Financial Information
 
The audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are attached hereto as Item 8 in this annual report.
 
Business of Issuer
 
Omnitek develops and sells a proprietary technology to convert diesel engines to an alternative fuel, new natural gas engines, and complementary products. Omnitek products are available for stationary applications and the global transportation markets, which includes light commercial vehicles, minibuses, heavy-duty trucks, municipal buses, as well as rail and marine applications. The technology can be applied for compressed natural gas (“CNG”), liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), or renewable natural gas (“Biogas” or “RNG”), as well as liquid petroleum gas (“Propane” or LPG”).
 
The technology Omnitek has developed can be used to convert most diesel engines to an alternative fuel at a cost lower than that required to purchase a new alternative fuel engine.
 
Engine conversions in the United States are subject to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approvals. The cost for converting an engine ranges from $15,000 to $35,000, depending on the engine model, exclusive of the cost of the natural gas storage system and labor. Engine conversions in certain foreign countries may require less sophisticated emission control components, resulting in 

Page 4

substantially reduced costs ranging from $3,000 to $15,000, depending on the engine model and application, again exclusive of the fuel storage system and labor. There has been a shift in demand for engine conversions, from domestic to international markets due primarily to higher diesel prices in those markets. With the price disparity between diesel and natural gas still a market driver, mostly as a result of higher taxes on diesel fuel, the Company anticipates the majority of its business to come from international markets for the foreseeable future. Additionally, it is expected that the 200-nation “Paris Agreement on Climate Change” and other local regulations designed to lower air pollution, will further increase demand for Omnitek’s technology, with foreign fleet conversions outpacing the domestic market until domestic diesel prices increase. 
 
The Company believes it is well-positioned in both global and domestic markets to capitalize on the increasing awareness of environmental concerns, and believes it has a cost advantage over new natural gas vehicles and other available technologies for the heavy-duty engine market.
 
 In addition to the engine conversion cost, fleets also have to consider the cost of the fuel storage tanks on the vehicle. This cost varies depending on the gas storage volume needed and the fuel tank technology used, but can range from $2,000 for a single tank system, up to $50,000 for a multi-tank system for heavy-duty class 8 over the road trucks.
 
Omnitek can also deliver complete new natural gas engines when local emission standards, or other conditions, require the use of new engines.

Principal Products or Services.

At this time the Omnitek product line includes:
 

A conversion kit for converting diesel engines to run on an alternative fuel; 
 
New complete natural gas engines; 
 
A high-pressure natural gas coalescing filter; and 
 
Natural gas components 
 
Conversion Kits - Omnitek offers a solution to convert diesel engines to operate on an alternative fuel, including CNG, LNG, RNG and LPG. This engine conversion technology is the primary product offered by Omnitek. This product is packaged in kit form and is offered in two basic variations. One is designed to work on engines with a turbocharger and the other is designed to work on engines without a turbocharger.
 
Diesel engines have a service life of up to 20 years and require regular engine overhauls. A diesel engine conversion is not unlike an engine overhaul. Therefore, the Company’s engine conversion system enables a fleet to “overhaul/convert” its diesel engines into an alternative fuel during its normally scheduled engine overhaul, thereby reducing overall operating costs and emissions.
 
Diesel engine conversions offer fleet operators the opportunity to secure their investment and capitalize on the long-life of diesel engines.
 
At this time the Company has received US, EPA approval for the Navistar DT466E and DT530E engines, and a Certificate of Conformity for the Mack E7, Detroit Diesel Series 60 and Caterpillar 3406E, C15, C15 ACERT and C16 engine models.
 
On June 23, 2015, the European Union issued a EURO VI Certificate for a 12-liter natural gas engine manufactured by TEDOM and equipped with the Omnitek proprietary technology.
 
In addition to the Conversion Kits, Omnitek sells the individual component replacement parts for the conversion kits. The high-pressure natural gas coalescent filter is our top-selling replacement part, which is also supplied to certain new natural gas vehicle manufacturers (“OEM”) as original equipment.

Page 5

The key to the success of Omnitek’s technology is performance and reliability, which is achieved using the Company’s patented fuel mixing device and a proprietary electronic control unit which senses engine parameters in real time and instantly makes fuel mixture adjustments to deliver the correct amount of fuel and the correct ignition timing.
 Omnitek does not perform installation of the conversion kits directly, but rather trains dealers and sub-dealers around the world to perform the engine conversions using its technology. Four to five days of training are required for a dealer or sub-dealer to become proficient to perform the engine conversion. Furthermore, Omnitek has established a strategic alliance with Minneapolis, Minnesota-based engine remanufacturer Reviva to produce remanufactured and converted drop-in ready natural gas engines, and a strategic alliance with LKQ Corporation (Nasdaq: LKQ) to produce drop-in ready natural gas engines at the company’s facility in Monterrey, Mexico, to address the market for natural gas engines in Mexico
 Most diesel engines can be converted using Omnitek’s technology, however, there is no assurance that diesel vehicle owners will elect to convert their diesel engines to an alternative fuel. Additionally, while the Company is not aware of any other company offering solutions for heavy duty diesel engine conversions that can compete with our patented technology at this time, competitors could develop such technology and there are no guarantees that the owners of the engines would choose the Omnitek conversion technology over our competitors’ technology to convert their engines.
 
New Natural Gas Engines - Under certain conditions it is not cost effective, or technologically feasible, to convert used diesel engines to operate on natural gas. Also, there are times when local emission standards may dictate the use of highly sophisticated technology that cannot be easily retrofitted to an older engine. Under those conditions, we can deliver a new purpose built natural gas engine.
Natural Gas Components – Omnitek supplies natural gas engine components to new engine manufacturers and aftermarket customers. The high-pressure natural gas coalescent filter is used by OE vehicle manufacturers around the world.

Markets

Worldwide
 
The Company has the ability to sell and deliver its products anywhere in the world through its network of distributors, system integrators, fleet operators, engine conversion companies and directly to end-users. The Company's conversion technology has been used to convert heavy-duty diesel engines to operate on natural gas worldwide since 2001and has been successfully adapted to work with many different engine designs and configurations. More than 5,000 engines have been converted worldwide utilizing the Omnitek technology.
 
The majority of our markets can best be divided into two groups:
 
1.
Countries not requiring compliance with emissions standards, or no standards are in place (therefore emissions certification is not necessary - shorter time to market); or, 
 
2.
Countries that require compliance with emissions standards (emissions certification is necessary - longer time to market and more costly). 
 
The governments of many countries with an indigenous supply of natural gas encourage the use of their domestic fuel supply and may offer incentives to convert vehicles currently running on diesel, which is expected to increase demand for our product in those regions.
 
When contacted, we approach the issue of “converting or replacing” high-polluting diesel engines by offering two main options, which in large part is influenced by the level of technological capabilities within the country, emission requirements, and financial feasibility.

Page 6

The first option is focused on working with local companies in an effort to convert diesel engines to natural gas. Alternatively, we can supply new dedicated natural gas engines as a second option.
 
To achieve the conversions, we can supply engineering support to rebuild and convert the engines locally. This offers an economic benefit to the local economy by keeping the rebuild work in the community. 
 
In the second scenario, we would supply brand new low-polluting, natural gas engines. This may be a better option when the existing engines are based on old and outdated technology and/or strict emissions standards are in place.
 
United States
 
Engine conversions in the United States are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and with regard to conversions within the state of California, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). 
 
In 2011, the EPA announced new regulations applicable to certifying and converting diesel and gasoline engines to operate on an alternative fuel. This was a milestone for the alternative fuel industry and a significant advancement in lessening the United States dependence on foreign oil. Converting diesel engines to operate on either CNG, LNG, RNG or LPG provides an economical and environmental solution to costly new engine replacements. These new EPA regulations have made it possible for Omnitek to certify and convert diesel engines in a cost-effective manner and introduce the technology to the U.S. market.
 
In 2014 CARB posted final regulations and guidelines to certify alternative fuel engine conversion systems for use in California, offering a pathway to certify our technology for use in California.
 
At this time the Company has received US,EPA approval for the Navistar DT466E and DT530E engines, and a Certificate of Conformity for the Mack E7, Detroit Diesel Series 60 and Caterpillar 3406E, C15, C15 ACERT and C16 engine models.
 
(3)
Distribution Methods of the Products or Services.

Omnitek has distributors in many countries which market and distribute its products. The Company is continuously seeking additional global distribution partners to expand its distribution network. In certain markets, the Company competes against other companies with greater resources, more established distribution channels and other competitive advantages, and the success of these competitors may harm our ability to generate revenues. Please see the section entitled “Competition” below and also the relevant Risk Factors in ITEM 1A below.
 
Distribution Agreements. From time to time, Omnitek may enter into exclusive or non-exclusive distribution agreements with its dealers, distributors or authorized diesel-to-natural gas engine conversion kit installation centers (“AIC”).
Internet. Our products, as well as information regarding new product introductions and company news, are available online at our website, www.omnitekcorp.com.

Status of any publicly announced new developments, product or services.

Further detail to following announcements can be found at http://www.omnitekcorp.com/news.htm
 On October 20, 2016, we received a contract to develop a EURO VI certified heavy-duty 13-liter natural gas engine. The new 13-liter 450 hp natural gas engine being developed will initially be utilized to power Class 8 trucks for freight movement in Europe.
Page 7

On July 11, 2016, the Company received international certification for its patented fuel rail technology, based on tests conducted by an independent agency and standards sanctioned by the United Nationals Economic Commission for Europe, specifically UN ECE R110.
 On June 16, 2016, Omnitek appointed Hiller Truck Tech Inc., based in Ontario, Canada, as an authorized diesel-to-natural gas engine conversion center to address the increasing demand for natural gas powered heavy-duty engines in Canada.
 
On December 6, 2017, Omnitek received a contract to develop Euro 6 heavy-duty 12-liter propane (LPG) Autogas Engine for Class 8 trucks. 
 
On July 2, 2018, Omnitek announced it has commenced shipments of the Company’s natural gas engine components to its exclusive distributor in China, Omnitek Beijing. The Omnitek system components will be utilized to convert large marine engines, mining-trucks and power generators from diesel to natural gas. Omnitek Beijing is a partner in a new manufacturing facility being built in Shandong Province with capacity for 40,000 natural gas engines annually. 
 
On October 09, 2018, Omnitek announced it has finalized the development of a 420 hp 13-liter heavy-duty natural gas engine. The engine, equipped with Omnitek’s patented engine management system components and a highly efficient catalytic converter, exceeded EURO 6 emissions requirements and will be utilized to power EURO 6 certified trucks and buses. Omnitek will be the exclusive OE supplier of key natural gas engine management system components required for the engine to meet the EURO 6 emissions standard.
 
Throughout the year, the Company supplied its existing customers around the world with conversion kits and components. TATA Motors of India has retained Omnitek as its OE supplier for of its high-pressure natural gas filter.
 
(5)
Competitive business conditions and the Company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition.

We believe our products have many important advantages, some of which are performance, ease of use, and lower cost. We compete in a small segment of the transportation and energy arena. Most of the larger multinational corporations do not offer a complete solution for the markets the Company services. We believe that competition in these markets is principally based on the quality of the product, performance, reliability and price. Because of the Company’s limited financial resources, Omnitek could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other suppliers of competitive products.
 
Competition - Diesel-to-Natural Gas Engine Conversions.
 
The Company encounters competing products in countries where no emission standards are enforced, and where carbureted systems are still being used such as China, India, Bangladesh, Peru and others. These systems can be used to convert low-power diesel engines found in these countries. When converting emissions controlled high-power engines, as found in the USA and Western Europe, a fuel injection system, like the Omnitek system, must be used.
 
As of today, the Company is not aware of any direct competitors offering a similar and extensive range of engine conversion kits for heavy-duty diesel engines required to meet US EPA or European EU emissions standards. Suppliers like Westport Innovations, Bosch and Keihin, just to name a few, supply mainly original equipment engine manufacturers and do not offer complete systems to convert diesel engines.
 
There are numerous companies, such as BRC, Landirenzo, Tartarini, OMVL, Tomasetto, just to name a few, supplying natural gas components for use on gasoline cars and small trucks. These technologies have been on the market for many years and millions of vehicles have been converted worldwide using these technologies. However, this technology is not suitable to convert heavy-duty diesel engines, and is not in direct competition with Omnitek’s technology. At this time Omnitek is not planning to compete in the small-engine market.

Page 8

Competition - Dual Fuel Technology
 
The dual fuel technology, where natural gas is mixed with diesel and both fuels are used at the same time, offers minimal cost savings potential and is not considered a competing technology.
Competition - New Natural Gas Engines.
 
Under certain conditions it is not cost effective, or technologically feasible, to convert used diesel engines to operate on natural gas. Emission standards sometimes dictate the use of highly sophisticated technology that cannot be easily retrofit onto an engine. For those situations, Omnitek offers purpose-built new natural gas engines which can be used in buses, trucks, generators and other stationary applications.
 
As of the time of this report there are a very limited number of new natural gas engine suppliers. In the United States only Cummins Westport offers EPA/CARB certified heavy-duty natural gas engines for trucks and buses. In Europe and China we find IVECO, Scania, MAN and Weichai, just to name a few. We believe that additional competitors will emerge as this market matures.

Sources and availability of Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers

Omnitek does not utilize any specialized raw materials. We rely on nonaffiliated suppliers for various standard and customized components and on manufacturers of assemblies that are incorporated into our products. We do not have long-term supply or manufacturing agreements with suppliers of raw materials, components and assemblies. In some instances alternative sources may be limited. If these suppliers or manufacturers experience financial, operational, manufacturing capacity, or quality assurance difficulties, or cease production and sale of such products, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with these suppliers or manufacturers, we will be required to locate alternative sources of supply. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components, if and as required in the future, may subject us to:
 
·
delays in delivery or shortages in components that could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellations of orders for our products; 
 ·
increased component prices and supply delays as we establish alternative suppliers; inability to develop alternative sources for product components; 
 ·
required modifications of our products, which may cause delays in product shipments, increased manufacturing costs, and increased product prices; and, 
 ·
increased inventory costs as we hold more inventory than we otherwise might in order to avoid problems from shortages or discontinuance, which may result in write-offs if we are unable to use all such products in the future. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, four suppliers accounted for 82% of products purchased compared with the year ended December 31, 2017, where four suppliers accounted for 85% of products purchased.
 
See Risk Factors Item “Dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or increased costs.”
 

(7)
Dependence on one or few major customers.

The Company believes that the diversity of the product line offered alleviates the dependence on any customer. Through a widespread use of our product line, Omnitek is striving to develop a wide base of customers. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, seven customers accounted for approximately 73% of sales.

The protection of proprietary rights relating to Omnitek’s products and expertise is critical for the business. Omnitek intends to file additional patent applications to protect certain technology and improvements considered important to the development of the Company’s business. The Company also intends to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position. 
 
Although the Company intends to seek patent protection for its proprietary technology and products in the United States and in foreign countries, the patent positions of our products, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the patent applications that we have and will consider filing will result in the issuance of any patents, or whether such patent applications will be circumvented or invalidated. There can be no assurance that all United States patents that may pose a risk of infringement can or will be identified. Additionally, Omnitek has not sought to identify foreign patent applications that might affect existing patent applications currently on file with the Unites States Patent and Trademark Office. If we are unable to obtain licenses where we may have infringed on other patents, we could encounter delays in product market introductions while attempting to design around such intellectual property rights, or we could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be prevented. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us on such intellectual property rights or prosecuting suits which the Company brings against other parties to protect its intellectual property rights. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed applications for, or have received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to, compounds or processes competitive with those of Omnitek. See number 5 above, “Competitive business conditions and the Company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition.”
 
The Company relies on certain patented and unpatented trade secrets for a significant part of its intellectual property rights, and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that Omnitek can meaningfully protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets. We intend to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements either upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with Omnitek or at a later time. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for Omnitek’s trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
We do not believe that any of our products or other proprietary rights infringe upon the rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that others may not assert infringement claims against Omnitek in the future and we recognize that any such assertion may require us to incur legal and other defense costs, enter into compromise royalty arrangements, or terminate the use of some technologies. Further, we may be required to incur legal and other costs to protect our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties.

Licenses and Royalty Agreements
 
We have not entered into any license and royalty agreements which have resulted in royalty payments.
 
Other Agreements
 
As part of the build-out of the U.S. and international dealer network, the Company has entered into agreements with various companies in the USA and foreign countries.
 
(9)
Need of any governmental approval of principal products or services.

Omnitek’s engine conversion technology as applied in the United States is subject to approval from the EPA and CARB within the State of California.
 
Currently Omnitek has received EPA approval and certification for our diesel-to-natural gas conversion technology for the heavy-duty Navistar DT466E and DT530E up to model year 2003, Mack E7E engines up to model year 2006, all Detroit Diesel Series 60 engine families for model years 1988 to 2009, and the Caterpillar 3406E/C15 engine families for model years 1993 to 2006.
 
(10)
Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business.

See item number 9, immediately above, for a discussion of EPA and CARB regulation.
 
Omnitek is subject to the requirements of Regulation 13A under the Exchange Act, which require us to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, and all other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers with stock registered pursuant to Section 12(g). We are also subject to Regulation 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), which regulates proxy solicitations.
 
Management believes that these reporting obligations increase the Company’s annual legal and accounting costs by an estimated $30,000 and $30,000, respectively.
 
Omnitek is not aware of any other governmental regulations now in existence or that may arise in the future that would have an effect on the Company’s business.
 
(11)
Research and Development.

Research and development expenditures for the last two fiscal years, 2018 and 2017, were $106,896 and $118,940 respectively, and were comprised of charges for engine certification testing, purchase of equipment and parts for R&D, and the cost of personnel in the development of products and services.
 
In some cases, Omnitek is contracted to develop a specific engine or component. In these cases, Omnitek requires an up-front payment from the customer.
 
Omnitek will certify additional engine models as needed. The cost to develop and certify a specific engine model can reach $125,000.
 
(12)
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws.

Except as discussed above in item number 9, our business activities are not subject to any environmental laws and we do not anticipate that our future business activities will subject the Company to any environmental compliance regulations.

Page 11

(13)
Number of total employees and number of full-time employees.

As of the date of this report, we employ a total of eight persons, all of whom are full-time employees. These full-time employees include Werner Funk and Richard Miller, who are also officers and directors of Omnitek. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees, who are not represented by a collective bargaining organization, and there no organized labor agreements or union agreements between Omnitek and any employees.
 
We are outsourcing certain services that are not proprietary in nature. We intend to continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers will enhance our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
 
Reports to Security Holders
 
The public may read and copy any materials the Company files with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington D.C. 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern Time. Information may be obtained on the operation of the public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. Moreover, the Company maintains a website at http://www.omnitekcorp.com that contains important information about Omnitek. This information is publicly available and is updated regularly.
 
Item 1. Description of Business - “Dependence on One or Few Major Customers.”
 
Dependence on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or increased costs.
 Our future operating results may depend substantially on our suppliers’ ability to supply us with components in sufficient volumes to meet our production requirements. Some components that we use are available from only a single or limited number of qualified suppliers. If there is a significant simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component from several high volume industries resulting in a supply reduction, if a component is otherwise in short supply, or if a supplier has a quality issue with a component, we may experience delays or increased costs in obtaining that component. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities used in the components, or other necessary components, we may experience production delays which could cause us loss of revenue. If a component becomes unavailable, we could suffer significant loss of revenue.
 
Each of the following could also significantly harm our operating results:
 
·
an unwillingness of a supplier to supply such components to us; 
 ·
consolidation of key suppliers; 
 ·
failure of a key supplier to provide enough components; 
 ·
a key supplier’s, or sub-supplier’s, inability to access credit necessary to operate its business; or 
 ·
failure of a key supplier to remain in business. 
 
Risk of technological obsolescence and competition
 
Omnitek operates in an ever-evolving field. Developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace in the industry in general. Competition from other large companies, joint ventures, research and academic institutions and others is intense and expected to increase. Many of these companies and institutions have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs and facilities than Omnitek, and many have substantially greater experience in conducting testing, manufacturing and marketing of products. These entities represent significant long-term competition for Omnitek. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our 

Page 20

technologies and future products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, Omnitek’s competitors might succeed in developing or purchasing technologies and products that are more effective than those that are being developed by the Company or that would render the Company's technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. See “Business – Competition.”
 
Dependence upon key personnel
 
Our success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend, in part, on its ability to retain qualified engineers, management and marketing personnel and in particular, to retain the services of Mr. Werner Funk, upon whom we are reliant on for the development of products for the Company.
 
In the event of the death, incapacity or departure of Mr. Funk from Omnitek, it is unlikely that we would be able to continue conducting our business plan in a timely manner. Even if we are able to find additional personnel to replace Mr. Funk it is uncertain whether we could find someone who could develop our business along the lines described in this report. We will fail without Mr. Funk or an appropriate replacement. We have acquired “key–man” life insurance on the life of Mr. Funk naming Omnitek as the beneficiary however there is no guarantee that this policy would be adequate to allow us to continue to operate in the event Mr. Funk should be unable to continue in his current position due to death, incapacity or some other unforeseen event.
 
Omnitek has an Employment Agreement in place with Mr. Funk that provides for continued service in his current capacities through January of 2021 and thereafter on a year-to-year basis. See “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table” for details of Employment Agreements.
 
Changes of prices for products
 
While the prices of our products are projected to be in line with those from market competitors, there can be no assurance that they will not decrease in the future. Competition may cause us to lower prices in the future. Moreover, it is difficult to raise prices even if internal costs increase.
 
Creditworthiness of distributors is an ongoing concern
 
Omnitek may not always be able to collect all of the funds owed to it by its distributors. Some distributors may experience financial difficulties which may adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable. We regularly review the collectability and creditworthiness of our distributors to determine an appropriate allowance for credit to such distributors. If our uncollectible accounts exceed that amount for which we have planned, this would adversely impact our operating results. Omnitek tries to minimize this concern by selling most of its products by way of prepaid purchase orders. 
 
C Corporation tax status
 
Omnitek is a C Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. All items of income and loss are taxed first at the corporate level and any dividends distributed to shareholders are taxed at the shareholder level as well.
 
Limited current sales and marketing capability
 
Though Omnitek has key personnel with experience in sales, marketing and distribution to market its products, we must either retain and hire the necessary personnel to distribute and market its products or enter into collaborative arrangements or distribution agreements with third parties who will market such products or develop their own marketing and sales force with technical expertise and supporting distribution capability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or hire the personnel with sufficient experience and knowledge to distribute and market its products or be able to enter into collaborative or distribution arrangements or develop its own sales force, or that such sales and marketing efforts, including the efforts of the companies with which Omnitek has entered into collaborative agreements, will be successful.

Page 21

Trading and limited market
 
At the present time, Omnitek common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the symbol OMTK. There is currently a limited public market for the Common Stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained. However, should such a market arise, the possibility or actual sale into the market of shares, as permitted under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, may adversely affect prevailing market prices, if any, for Omnitek’s Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of its equity securities. In order to qualify for unrestricted resale of Common Stock under Rule 144, certain holding periods must be met and a legal opinion setting forth the exemption from registration must be provided. Further, there is no assurance that Rule 144 will be applicable to Omnitek and investors may not be able to rely on its provisions now or in the future. In addition, sales of significant amounts of Common Stock by Omnitek could have an adverse effect on the market price.
 
No dividends
 
No cash dividends have been paid. Payment of dividends on the Common Stock is within the discretion of the Board of Directors, is subject to state law, and will depend upon our earnings, if any, its capital requirements, financial condition and other relevant factors.
 
Possible volatility of stock price
 
The market price of our securities is likely to be highly volatile. Factors such as the market acceptance of Omnitek’s products, success of distribution channels or its competitors, announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors, developments in trademark, patent or other proprietary rights of Omnitek or our competitors, and fluctuations in our operating results may have a significant effect on the market price of the Common Stock. In addition, the stock market has experienced and continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of many companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price, if a market develops, of the Common Stock. See “Description of Capital Stock.”
 
We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce our ability to earn a profit.
 
We are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel will have to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. We may be exposed to potential risks resulting from requirements under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.
 
Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended by SEC Release 33-8889 we are required to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the year. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial

fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.
 
Management believes that these reporting obligations will increase Omnitek’s annual legal and accounting costs by an estimated $30,000 and $30,000, respectively.
 
Penny stock regulations
 
If Omnitek’s stock is below $5.00 per share, or we do not have $2,000,000 in net tangible assets, or are not listed on an exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System, among other conditions, our shares may be subject to a rule promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Furthermore, if the price of Omnitek’s stock is below $5.00, and does not meet the conditions set forth above, sales of our stock in the secondary market will be subject to certain additional new rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules generally require, among other things, that brokers engaged in secondary trading of stock provide customers with written disclosure documents, monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks, disclosure of the bid and asked prices, and disclosure of the compensation to the broker-dealer and disclosure of the sales person working for the broker-dealer. These rules and regulations may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell Omnitek's securities, thereby limiting the liquidity of the securities. They may also affect the ability of shareholders to resell their securities in the secondary market.
