Item 1.   Business
 
Friedman Industries, Incorporated (the “Company”), a Texas corporation incorporated in 1965, is a manufacturer and processor of steel products and operates in two reportable segments; coil products and tubular products. Significant financial information relating to the Company’s business segments for the last two years is contained in Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, which financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in Item 8 hereof.
 
Coil Products 
 
The coil product segment consists of the operation of two hot-roll coil processing facilities; one in Hickman, Arkansas (“Hickman”) and the other in Decatur, Alabama (“Decatur”). Each facility operates a temper mill and a cut-to-length line. The temper mill improves the flatness and surface qualities of the coils and the cut-to-length line levels the steel and cuts the coils into sheet and plate of prescribed lengths. Combined, the facilities are capable of cutting sheet and plate with thicknesses ranging from 14 gauge to ½” thick. The coil product segment sells its prime grade inventory under the Friedman Industries name but also maintains an inventory of non-standard coil products, consisting primarily of mill secondary and excess prime coils, which are sold through the Company’s XSCP division. The coil product segment also processes customer-owned coils on a fee basis.
 
The Hickman and Decatur facilities are substantially similar with respect to machinery, equipment and products produced. The Company makes shipments of coil products based on which facility offers the desired product or, if the product is available at both facilities, based on other factors, such as customer location, freight conditions and the ability of the facility to fulfill the order on a timely basis. Coil products are sold on a wholesale, rapid-delivery basis in competition with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. Shipments are made via unaffiliated truckers or by rail.
 
The coil segment purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Tubular Products 
 
The tubular product segment consists of the Company’s Texas Tubular Products division (“TTP”) located in Lone Star, Texas. TTP operates two electric resistance welded pipe mills with a combined outside diameter (“OD”) size range of 2 3/8” OD to 8 5/8” OD. Both pipe mills are American Petroleum Institute (“API”) licensed to manufacture line pipe and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. TTP has a pipe finishing facility that threads and couples oil country tubular goods and performs other services that are customary in the pipe finishing process. The pipe finishing facility is API licensed and focuses on threading semi-premium connections. TTP’s inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods. Raw material inventory consists of hot-rolled steel coils that TTP will manufacture into pipe. Finished goods inventory consists of pipe TTP has manufactured and new mill reject pipe that TTP purchases from U.S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc.
 
TTP purchases its inventory from a limited number of suppliers. Loss of any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Coil Products.  The Company sells coil products and processing services to approximately 170 customers located primarily in the midwestern, southwestern and southeastern regions of the United States. The Company’s principal customers for these products and services are steel distributors and customers manufacturing steel products such as steel buildings, railroad cars, barges, tanks and containers, trailers, component parts and other fabricated steel products. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, sales of coil products to Trinity Industries, Inc. accounted for approximately 21% and 16% of the Company’s total sales, respectively.
 
The Company sells substantially all of its coil products through its own sales force. At March 31, 2019, the sales force was comprised of the Vice President of Sales – Coil Divisions and four professional sales personnel. Sales personnel are paid on a salary and commission basis.
 
Tubular Products.  The Company sells its tubular products nationally to approximately 125 customers. The Company’s principal customers for these products are steel and pipe distributors. In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, no individual tubular customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total sales.
 
The Company sells substantially all of its tubular products through its own sales force. At March 31, 2019, the sales force was comprised of the Vice President of Sales – Tubular Division and two professional sales personnel. Sales personnel are paid on a salary and commission basis.
 
Competition 
 
The Company is engaged in a non-seasonal, highly-competitive business. The Company competes with other processors of hot-rolled steel coils. The steel industry, in general, is characterized by a small number of extremely large companies dominating the bulk of the market and a large number of relatively small companies, such as the Company, competing for a limited share of such market.
 

The Company believes that, generally, its ability to compete is dependent upon its ability to offer products at prices competitive with or below those of other steel suppliers, as well as its ability to provide products meeting customer specifications on a rapid-delivery basis.
 
Employees 
 
At March 31, 2019, the Company had 104 full-time employees and no part-time employees.
