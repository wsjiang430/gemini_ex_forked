Overview
 Ra Medical Systems, Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”)  is a commercial-stage medical device company leveraging our advanced excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular and dermatological immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. We believe our products enhance patients’ quality of life by restoring blood-flow in arteries and clearing chronic skin conditions. Following the temporary placement period for the DABRA laser system and single-use catheter, together referred to as DABRA, and once our customers decide to continue using DABRA in their facilities, we typically enter into DABRA laser commercial usage agreements or DABRA laser placement acknowledgements with each customer, which we refer to collectively as Usage Agreements. The terms of the Usage Agreements vary by customer, but each Usage Agreement provides for the specific terms of continued use of DABRA, including periodic maintenance fees and do not provide for a minimum purchase obligation
. As of December 31, 2018, we had 53 lasers at customer sites under signed Usage Agreements, with varying volumes of purchases. DABRA is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a device for crossing chronic total occlusions, or CTOs, in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. DABRA is used as a tool in the treatment of peripheral artery disease, or PAD, a form of peripheral vascular disease, which commonly occurs in the legs. These procedures are typically referred to in the medical community as atherectomy procedures, which the medical community commonly defines as any removal by surgery or specialized catheterization of an atheroma, or blockage, in an artery. Even though the medical community refers to it as atherectomy, DABRA is not currently cleared by the FDA for atherectomy. Nevertheless, third-party health payers can reimburse a procedure performed by a device which is not cleared or approved for a specific indication or procedure, if the physician determines the device and procedure are medically appropriate for a particular patient. Payers and the medical community can take a broader view than FDA in recognizing the scope of appropriate device use. In order to address this perceived uncertainty regarding reimbursement, we currently are pursuing expanded indications for use for DABRA to include an atherectomy indication for use, which the FDA currently defines to include a prespecified improvement in luminal patency, or a prespecified increase in the openness of the artery at a pre-defined time point, and an indication for use for the treatment of in-stent restenosis. To satisfy the FDA’s data requirements to support an atherectomy indication, we plan to perform a new study designed to allow the FDA to evaluate the DABRA atherectomy procedure.  The first subject is projected to be enrolled and treated in the second quarter of 2019, and we expect to have final results of the trial in the first quarter of 2020. We believe the incremental cost of obtaining the atherectomy indication will not be material. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the prospective long-term revascularization study of DABRA titled REvascularization RateS and Clinical OUtcomes with DABRA Laser. A Long-Term 2-year Study (RESULTS). This registry is being conducted to measure the benefit and the safety profile of DABRA over a longer time frame (two years) than our pivotal trial, which had a 180 day follow up.  We have case reports of patients with extended freedom from restenosis even out to over four years, which prompted us to study longer-term outcomes more closely.  We intend to provide updates on a periodic basis throughout the study.  
 In addition, we intend to pursue additional uses for DABRA, including seeking regulatory clearance or approval for the use of DABRA as a tool for the treatment of vascular blockages associated with coronary artery disease, or CAD, in-stent restenosis, and other venous and arterial occlusions, or blockages in the veins or arteries. However, there can be no assurance that DABRA will receive the necessary clearances for these additional indications. The DABRA laser system is based on the same core technology and utilizes a similar excimer laser as Pharos, a medical device that we have marketed as a tool for the treatment of proliferative skin conditions since October 2004. Pharos is designed for use in the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions and is FDA cleared as a tool used in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. Because DABRA and Pharos are both based on our core excimer laser technology platform and deploy similar mechanisms of action, we benefit from economies of scale in product development, manufacturing, quality assurance and distribution.

DABRA.    DABRA (Destruction of Arteriosclerotic Blockages by Laser Radiation Ablation) is our minimally-invasive excimer laser and single-use catheter system that is used by physicians as a tool in the endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease, a form of PAD, both above- and below-the-knee, by breaking down plaque to its fundamental chemistry, such as proteins, lipids and other chemical compounds, eliminating blockages by essentially dissolving them without generating potentially harmful particulates. The accumulation of plaque in arteries, which is a result of lower extremity vascular disease, most commonly occurs in the pelvis and legs. Plaque accumulation, known as atherosclerosis, causes the narrowing of arteries, thereby reducing the flow of oxygenated blood to tissue and organs. If vascular blockages are left untreated, they can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, amputation or death. Major risk factors for PAD include age, smoking, diabetes and obesity. Despite its prevalence, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including CAD, in part because up to half of the PAD population is asymptomatic, or shows no symptoms, and many dismiss symptoms as normal signs of aging. Recent analysis suggests that 17.6 million people in the U.S. suffer from PAD. However, only 20-30% of PAD patients are actively being treated.
 Current treatments for vascular blockages associated with PAD are largely endovascular and include angioplasty, stenting and atherectomy. Bypass surgery, which was frequently used in the past, is costly and often results in complications, including high levels of post-surgery pain and lengthy hospital stays and recovery times. Endovascular treatments employ catheter-based products for the displacement or removal of plaque. These treatments also have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease. We believe one of the main contributing factors to high restenosis, or the re-accumulation of blockages, rates for PAD patients treated with endovascular technologies is the amount of vascular injury that occurs during an intervention. Angioplasty balloons, invented in the 1970’s, held a great deal of promise, but the trauma due to their inflation often causes the vessel to reocclude either immediately or over time. Stents, invented in the 1980’s, were developed to help keep the arteries open. However, stents can also promote re-occlusion and are susceptible to fractures. Devices that remove plaque, including the excimer laser, invented in the 1990’s, were developed to overcome the drawbacks of angioplasty balloons and stents, which push the plaque to the side of the vessel. DABRA was designed to remove the plaque with less trauma in order to improve patient outcomes when compared to other competing devices.
 DABRA is a novel technology for use in the endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease. We believe that our liquid-filled, full aperture ratio catheter allows for a less traumatic endovascular treatment for the removal of vascular blockages and offers significant benefits over competing treatments and therapies. DABRA is easy to use with proper physician training and can cross and debulk, or reduce or remove, a broad range of blockage types without the use of a guidewire. Although DABRA is suitable for use as a monotherapy, or a therapy that uses one type of treatment, it is predominantly used with angioplasty balloons and also can be used adjunct to drug-eluting balloons, stents, and other endovascular treatments. DABRA employs photochemical ablation, or the removal of body tissue by using photons, to remove blockages by breaking the bonds of the obstructing plaque directly. Unlike many treatments for PAD and other vascular diseases that may damage the arterial wall, DABRA photochemically dissolves plaque quickly and with minimal vascular trauma. DABRA is minimally invasive and is designed to not stretch the arterial walls or penetrate the layers of arterial tissue known as the subintimal space, which can lead to dissection, or a tear in the inner lining of the vessel wall, or perforation, or a hole or a break in the vessel wall, although these events may still occur with DABRA and other competing products. We believe that endovascular treatments using DABRA may be more durable and longer lasting than treatments using other devices because of the reduced mechanical trauma, thermal trauma, and barometric trauma, or trauma due to change in pressure inside the vessel. Independent in vivo and in vitro research studies have demonstrated that 308 nanometer excimer laser light, which is the same wavelength used in DABRA, increases T-cell apoptosis, which may produce an immunosuppressive effect. While we have not established the benefits of this potential immunosuppressant effect in the vasculature, or blood vessels such as arteries or veins, we may conduct a study in the future to identify any immunotherapeutic benefits.

The safety and effectiveness of the DABRA laser system and single-use DABRA catheter is supported by our pivotal study, a non-randomized, single-arm, prospective, multi-site study conducted to evaluate plaque photoablation using DABRA in the endovascular treatment of lower extremity vascular disease. The study enrolled 64 patients at four sites with both above-the-knee and below-the-knee lesions. The final study results demonstrated 94% effectiveness in successful crossing of the target lesion based on angiographic analysis, or a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside of blood vessels, at time of the procedure with 0% reported serious adverse events (SAEs). In a study conducted by Spectranetics Corporation, or Spectranetics, as part of its 510(k) application for its CLiRpath Excimer Laser Catheter device, which was the predicate device for our 510(k) application, Spectranetics reported a 79% crossing success with its catheter device and a 72% procedure success in a total of 47 cases. Cumulatively, Spectranetics reported that there were 16, or 34%, SAEs reported during the six month follow-up period with the most frequently observed event being reintervention, which occurred in six, or 13%, of cases. The endpoints of both studies were at the time of procedure and at 30 days. Although our pivotal study was not head-to-head with the Spectranetics study, and we may not claim superiority of safety or efficacy, we believe that the patient population in our pivotal study that supported our 510(k) application was substantially similar to the patient population in the Spectranetics study mentioned above.
 In May 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the DABRA laser system and single-use DABRA catheter in the U.S. for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. In June 2018, we completed our 12-month commercial launch period, which included initial 
training, production, and staffing for the marketing of DABRA in the United States. We market DABRA in the U.S. through our direct sales force, comprised of 35 personnel as of December 31, 2018, including sales personnel who place lasers in catheterization laboratories that perform high volumes of endovascular procedures, including plaque removal in peripheral arteries. We have plans to increase sales by further expanding this organization. We are initially focused on placing DABRA in outpatient-based laboratories, or OBLs, and subsequently we intend to expand into the hospital catheterization laboratory market. Reimbursement claims for DABRA procedures are typically submitted by the provider to Medicare or another third-party payor using established Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. DABRA was granted CE mark approval in September 2016 for the endovascular treatment of infrainguinal arteries via atherectomy and for crossing total occlusions, and we sell systems through distributors in select non-U.S. countries.
 Pharos.    Pharos is our excimer laser device that emits highly concentrated ultraviolet light and is used as a tool in the treatment of dermatological skin disorders. Physicians use Pharos by applying 308 nanometer ultraviolet light to the skin. The FDA has granted 510(k) clearance to market Pharos in the U.S. for psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. Pharos was granted CE mark approval in September of 2016 for use in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis and leukoderma by the application of UVB ultraviolet light. We have also received clearance to market Pharos from the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, and South Korea Ministry of Drug Safety (now called the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MDFS), in the applicable jurisdictions. Pharos offers significant benefits to patients. The targeted nature of our treatment allows the operator to spare healthy tissue from exposure to the ultraviolet light making the treatment faster and safer than some other forms of phototherapy, or light therapy. The light induces T-cell apoptosis which we believe may produce an immunosuppressant effect. For instance, Pharos is not contraindicated for children and pregnant women, allowing for their treatment. In addition, we believe excimer laser treatments can put patients into remission from certain diseases. Treatment with Pharos differs from topical treatments, such as steroids and vitamin D derivatives, which may require frequent ongoing application. Treatment with Pharos also differs from pharmaceutical treatments, which may be associated with systemic side effects.
 Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes cells to build up rapidly and affects the surface of the skin. The National Psoriasis Foundation reports that psoriasis affects approximately 7.5 million people in the U.S., which accounts for over 2% of the domestic population. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition in which the skin turns white due to the loss of melanocytes, cells that produce the pigment melanin, which gives skin color. Vitiligo affects 1-2% of the population globally. Atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as eczema, is a chronic eczematous skin disease. There are more than 18 million people in the U.S. suffering from atopic dermatitis, according to the National Eczema Association. Leukoderma is the localized loss of pigment in the skin due to several causes including vitiligo.

Vascular Disease
 Vascular disease refers to diseases of the heart and blood vessels located throughout the body. The most common cause of vascular disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a progressive, degenerative condition in which plaque, consisting of lipids, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood stream, accumulates on the arterial wall. Plaque occurs in several different forms and may be located throughout the arterial system. Plaque varies in composition, with portions that are hard and brittle, referred to as calcified plaque, and other portions that are fatty or fibrous. Endovascular treatments for atherosclerosis are performed in a catheterization laboratory located in an OBL or hospital. These patients are diagnosed by their primary care physician, podiatrist, or other specialist, and then treatment is performed by an interventional cardiologist, interventional radiologist, or vascular surgeon.
 PAD is atherosclerosis of the extremities, most commonly in the legs. Smoking, genetic predisposition, diabetes, aging, and obesity may significantly increase the risk of developing PAD. Plaque build-up reduces blood-flow to the surrounding tissue, causing claudication, pain or cramping in the leg, the most common early symptom of PAD. Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the legs and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the feet or toes.
 As PAD progresses, additional symptoms may develop on the legs, including cooling, color changes, or sores that do not heal. If untreated, PAD can lead to critical limb ischemia, or CLI, a condition where there is not enough oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb to keep the tissue alive. As of June 2017, the SAGE Group reported that conservatively 22 to 30 million people suffer from CLI worldwide. If untreated, CLI may result in ulceration, infection, or gangrene in the feet and legs and eventually limb amputation or death.
 Market Overview
 Recent analysis suggests that approximately 18 million people in the U.S. suffer from PAD. Despite its prevalence, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including CAD, in part because up to half of the PAD population is asymptomatic and many dismiss symptoms as normal signs of aging. Research indicates only 20-30% of PAD patients are actively being treated.
 Without treatment, the disease can result in severe complications and lead to amputation. The most common reason for amputation today is PAD, and up to 180,000 amputations are performed annually in the U.S. Despite the relative under diagnosis and treatment of PAD, the atherectomy devices industry achieved a $1.08 billion market in 2017 and is estimated to grow at CAGR of over 6% from 2018 to 2022. Higher diagnosis and intervention rates resulting from greater physician and patient awareness of PAD, as well as higher prevalence, are helping drive the market opportunity for PAD treatments.
 We believe that the following factors are contributing to a growing diagnosed patient population:
  
• | Increased Awareness. Recent emphasis on PAD education from medical associations, insurance companies and online medical communities, as well as publication in medical journals is increasing public and physician awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms and treatment options. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evolving Physician Practice Patterns. Given that many patients with CAD also have PAD, we believe that interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons are increasingly screening patients for both diseases. As a result, we believe that physicians are diagnosing more cases of PAD. In addition, we believe that heightened awareness of PAD, its symptoms and treatment options is leading to increased referrals. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventional Means of Treatment and Their Limitations
 Physicians typically treat patients with mild to moderate PAD through non-invasive management, including exercise and prescription medication, and, if symptoms worsen, may recommend interventional or surgical procedures. Some patients who initially are diagnosed with severe PAD are treated immediately through interventional or surgical procedures.
 7


Non-Invasive Management.    For many diagnosed cases of PAD in the U.S., lifestyle changes, including improved diet, regular exercise and smoking cessation, as well as drug treatment are often prescribed. Although these measures can be effective, many people do not sustain them. In addition, these measures may reduce the symptoms, but do not treat the underlying causes of the disease. Physicians may also prescribe medications that lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure. These drug therapies are generally prescribed for the life of the patient and do not treat the obstruction, making them an ineffective treatment for many patients. As a result, many of these patients will ultimately require more aggressive treatments.
 Interventional Procedures.    When PAD progresses beyond claudication, physicians may advise intervention, often beginning with minimally-invasive procedures. Minimally invasive endovascular treatments include balloon angioplasty, stents, and plaque removal devices. These treatments have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease. We believe that there are over 500,000 annual endovascular procedures for the treatment of PAD in the U.S. Angioplasty and stenting are the most commonly performed minimally-invasive interventional treatments.

• | Angioplasty. In an angioplasty procedure, a long, thin tube, or catheter, with a balloon tip is inserted into the blocked or narrowed part of the artery over a previously positioned guide wire that directs the catheter to the affected area. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the plaque and stretching the arterial wall. While angioplasty catheters are relatively easy to use, they stretch the arterial wall, often leading to dissections of, and damage to, the arterial walls. Angioplasty does not remove the plaque, which remains in the artery. In addition, angioplasty is not well suited to treat highly calcified lesions, lesions concentrated on one side of the arterial wall, or lesions that occur at bifurcations, all common manifestations of PAD in the leg. Also, most angioplasty procedures for PAD are performed with the additional use of a stent. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stenting. Stenting is performed in tandem with angioplasty. A stent is a wire-mesh tube that acts as a scaffold inside the artery to keep it open. Stents are currently available in a wide range of varieties. Despite their widespread use, stents may cause injury and inflammation to the arterial wall during placement and continued trauma post-procedure. Stents placed in the legs are subject to force and compression that may fracture or crush them, leading to reduced blood-flow and further vessel trauma. Once a stent is implanted, it cannot be removed, which may limit future treatment options such as angioplasty, additional stenting, atherectomy and bypass. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plaque Removal Devices. Procedures to remove plaque are often referred to in the medical field as atherectomy procedures. There are several types of atherectomy devices, including directional, rotational and laser, each with different mechanisms of action to remove plaque. Atherectomy treatments are frequently used with a stent or balloon. Atherectomy technologies can damage the vessel walls, which may increase the risk of restenosis. For example, cutting devices, such as directional or rotational devices, introduce significant mechanical trauma and other commercial laser devices have a significant thermal component due to the arrangement of the delivery catheter, both of which can cause trauma to the artery. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Surgical Procedures.    Most PAD patients are treated endovascularly. Many of these patients, including diabetics, are not candidates for surgical procedures. However, surgery is used when non-invasive management or interventional procedures have failed or if the patient is diagnosed when PAD has progressed to an advanced state.

• | Bypass Surgery. More severe cases of PAD may be treated by surgeons with bypass surgery. The blood flow is diverted around the occluded area using a synthetic graft or harvested vessel. Bypass surgery is performed by physicians in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia and requires multi-day hospital stays for healing and rehabilitation. General anesthesia and the potential for surgical infections make this approach less suitable for patients with conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or poor kidney function. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amputation. CLI is a serious form of PAD caused by severe lack of blood flow to the legs. Physicians may recommend full or partial amputation of the leg or foot for patients with CLI. Up to 180,000 amputations occur annually in the U.S. as a result of PAD

Our Solution
 Strengths of Our Approach
 DABRA includes a portable excimer laser system combined with proprietary, single-use catheters that together represent a competitive plaque removal solution for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of blockages in the vasculature. DABRA represents a novel approach to the treatment of a broad range of vascular blockages that is safe and effective, easy to use, and competitively priced. We believe that the principal benefits of DABRA are:

• | Safety. DABRA is designed to track the patient’s true lumen, or the center of the artery, and not to penetrate between the layers of arterial structure known as the subintimal space. Damage or stretching of the arterial walls, which can lead to dissection or perforation, may be reduced. No SAEs were reported in our 2017 pivotal study, which followed 38 subjects for 180 days, or reported in our post-market surveillance for DABRA. In our post-market surveillance, the most frequent complication reported to us has been clinically non-significant vessel perforation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficacy. Unlike many treatments for PAD that do not remove plaque, DABRA employs photochemical ablation to disintegrate plaque by breaking its chemical bonds, thereby reducing the plaque to the components of its fundamental chemistry without generating potentially harmful particulates. We believe that eliminating plaque while minimizing injury to the arterial wall may minimize the rate of restenosis. We followed 38 subjects from our pivotal study to 180 days thereafter and all of the subjects were determined to be free of target lesion revascularization, or the need to retreat the lesion. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility. DABRA enables physicians to remove plaque from long and calcified lesions in arteries located in the lower extremities both above- and below-the-knee. DABRA is able to cross and debulk a wide variety of plaque, removing vascular blockages that other products are unable to cross without the use of a guidewire. For example, in patients with a CTO, the physician may use DABRA to cross the CTO prior to alternative treatments consisting of balloon angioplasty and possibly stenting. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Use. DABRA employs techniques similar to those used in angioplasty, which are familiar to the approximately 10,000 interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the U.S. who are generally trained in endovascular techniques. This significantly increases the number of physicians who are able to perform the procedure compared to surgical alternatives that must be performed by highly-trained vascular surgeons. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost and Time Efficient. We believe that because our single-use DABRA catheters are priced competitively and because we provide the DABRA laser system for a nominal periodic fee without requiring the purchase of capital equipment, DABRA is a cost-effective solution for providers. Providers are also eligible for reimbursement for procedures that are performed using DABRA by using existing Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. The existence of a CPT code does not guarantee reimbursement, and payors impose restrictions on the use of codes. In addition, DABRA’s easy setup and fast ablation speed reduce both treatment and fluoroscopy time, or x-ray exposure time, for the patient, physician, and staff, improving the providers’ patient throughput. The average lasing time in our pivotal study was approximately two and a half minutes per procedure. Cost and time efficiencies can trigger Medicare payment reductions based on the resource based relative value payment methodology. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunotherapeutic Benefits. Research performed using 308 nanometer laser energy, the wavelength of Pharos, demonstrated increased T-cell apoptosis, which may produce an immunosuppressant effect. Unlike with Pharos, where we can measure the degree and speed of clearance of disease and quantify the remission time, with DABRA we have not established the benefits of this immunosuppressant effect in the vasculature. We may, in the future, conduct a study to identify any immunotherapeutic benefits. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading medical device company marketing excimer lasers as tools for the treatment of endovascular diseases. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Driving physician awareness of DABRA. Our program to educate physicians regarding DABRA’s value proposition consists of presentations and exhibits at industry conferences, advertising in medical journals, direct visits, webinars, and calls. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Creating patient awareness of DABRA. We are establishing marketing and support programs with physicians and patient advocacy organizations to create patient awareness of PAD treatment options in order to generate demand for our products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding DABRA sales. We provide physicians with clinical training to drive adoption and utilization of DABRA. We believe that a strong sales team to train physicians on the correct use and the benefits of DABRA will increase sales. We expect to continue to expand the clinical sales team through 2019 and beyond. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extending DABRA to additional indications. We plan to leverage our product technology and research and development expertise to develop DABRA for additional vascular indications, such as CAD and in-stent restenosis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding commercial opportunities for DABRA internationally. We received the right to affix the CE mark to DABRA in the third quarter of 2016, permitting DABRA to be marketed and sold in Europe and other CE mark markets. We plan to expand commercial opportunities for DABRA internationally through obtaining additional regulatory approvals and expanding our relationships with international distributors. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimizing existing manufacturing capabilities to generate operating leverage. We design, develop and manufacture DABRA in-house using components and sub-assemblies provided by third-party suppliers. We believe that by controlling the manufacturing and assembly of our products we are able to innovate more quickly, produce higher quality products, and increase our manufacturing scale in a cost-effective manner. We intend to use our design, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities to further improve the efficiency of our manufacturing process and increase our margins. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding our product offerings. We believe that we will be able to leverage our technology and sales platform to expand our endovascular offerings with ancillary endovascular devices such as angioplasty balloons, guide catheters, and introducers. We intend to achieve this through our internal development efforts and with selective licenses, alliances or acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses.

Products
 The DABRA Product
 DABRA combines a portable excimer laser console with proprietary, single-use catheters for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease in both above- and below-the-knee lesions. We have significant expertise in excimer lasers gained from over a decade developing, manufacturing, testing, marketing, and servicing the Pharos excimer laser for dermatological diseases, and have leveraged this expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of DABRA.
 We believe that DABRA is the only endovascular device that crosses chronic total occlusions and removes plaque without a guidewire. The most important aspect of DABRA for the vascular market is the catheter, which conducts energy from the laser to the vascular blockage. The laser energy travels through the catheter and ablates the blockage, reducing it to chemicals that are found naturally in the bloodstream. The catheters are sterilized single-use only and specifically designed for our laser-based systems. The DABRA catheter uses a liquid-filled plastic tubing instead of glass fiber optic construction allowing for the efficient and precise delivery of the laser energy.
 10


The DABRA catheter is a single-use, 5 French gauge catheter that does not use a guidewire to navigate vasculature and that typically stays within the normal area in which blood is flowing or true lumen, even while crossing blockages. It is a full aperture ratio forward cutter, delivering fast ablation of all types of plaque, without the “dead-space” of fiber optic bundle catheters. It produces a high quality lumen while minimizing trauma to the vasculature. The DABRA catheter has a 1.5 millimeter blunt-tip design and a working length of 150 cm that tracks the true lumen, navigating the vascular curves. DABRA catheters have been used with a variety of introducers and guide catheters. They have been used in both above- and below-the-knee procedures, including axially, femorally, both antegrade and retrograde, from popliteal access and pedal access, both anterior tibial and posterior tibial. DABRA removes plaque by photochemical ablation, limiting the vascular trauma caused by mechanical forces, acoustic or thermal energy, or vapor bubbles, which may occur when using competing products.
 The DABRA excimer laser is the power source for DABRA catheters that generates a laser light by a software controlled 308 nm excimer laser source that produces 308 nanometer ultraviolet-B photons that are directed to the catheter through a lens to photochemically ablate vascular blockages, reducing calcium, thrombus, and atheroma into their fundamental chemistry, minimizing downstream debris.
 DABRA ablation produces fast treatment times and minimizes fluoroscopy time. The laser is small enough for most catheterization laboratories, weighs approximately 110 pounds, and is easily portable around and between rooms. It is easy-to-use, features a simple and intuitive operator-interface, plugs into a standard 110-volt outlet, and does not require any pumps or fluids.

The DABRA Catheter
 
The DABRA Procedure
 During the procedure, the physician inserts the proximal end of the single-use DABRA catheter into the laser console. Using the buttons next to the screen of the console, the physician enters the calibration mode and inserts the catheter into the calibration port of the console to perform the calibration. The physician sets the treatment settings on the touch screen. The physician then inserts the catheter into the support catheter and under fluoroscope, advances the catheter to the target lesion. The physician uses the footswitch to activate the laser unit and slowly advances the catheter to ablate the target lesion.
 Depending upon the type of lesion, DABRA can cross blockages at a rate of up to one centimeter per second. The DABRA procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia in a catheterization laboratory. Procedures performed using DABRA have an approximate two and a half minute total lasing time. A patient treated in an OBL is discharged the same day.

Clinical Studies and Patient Data
 Pre-Marketing Studies.    We applied and received FDA IDE approval for our pivotal study. It was a non-randomized, single-arm, prospective, multi-site study that enrolled 64 patients at four sites. The objective of the study was to evaluate plaque photoablation using DABRA in the endovascular treatment resulting from lower extremity vascular disease of patients with Rutherford categories 3, 4, 5 and 6. The primary efficacy endpoint was the successful crossing of the target lesion based on angiographic analysis at time of the procedure. The safety endpoint was device-related major adverse events at the time of the procedure. It was conducted at four centers including the California Heart and Vascular Center, an OBL in El Centro, California, Centro Medico Excel, a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, the University of California, San Diego, a major teaching hospital in San Diego, California, and Merit Health Wesley, a hospital in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. As part of the inclusion criteria for the DABRA study, the target blockage must have been refractory to guidewire crossing. The average lasing time in our study was approximately two and a half minutes and the average lesion measured over seven centimeters, which is representative of a typical patient suffering from severe lower extremity vascular disease. The analyses pre- and post-treatment were performed using standard angiographic and ultrasonic tools which are commonly used in commercial catheterization laboratories.
 The study was closed to enrollment on May 24, 2017 when we received 510(k) clearance for DABRA and contained data on 64 patients. The final study results demonstrated 94% effectiveness with 0% reported SAEs. Furthermore, in our study, 64 lesions crossed were above the knee, or approximately 85%, and 11 lesions crossed were below-the-knee, or approximately 15%. In a study conducted by Spectranetics as part of its 510(k) application for its CLiRpath Excimer Laser Catheter device, which was the predicate device for our 510(k) application, Spectranetics reported a 79% crossing success with its catheter device and a 72% procedure success in a total of 47 cases. Cumulatively, Spectranetics reported that there were 16, or 34%, SAEs reported during the six month follow-up period with the most frequently observed event being reintervention, which occurred in six, or 13%, of cases.
 The endpoints were at the time of procedure, at 30 and 180 days. Although our pivotal study was not head-to-head with the Spectranetics study, and we may not claim superiority of safety or efficacy, we believe that the patient population in our pivotal study that supported our 510(k) application was substantially similar to the patient population in the Spectranetics study. The following is a summary of our clinical study for DABRA:
 
 
 | Patients | | Age | | | | 
--------+----------+----+-----+----+------+---------+-------------
 | (64) | | M | | F | Patient | # of Serious | 
 | M | | F | | Mean | Median | Mean | | Median | | Successes | Adverse Events
Totals: | | 48 | | 16 | | 71 | | 69 | | 75 | | 77 | 60 | —


Lesion Locations | Number of Lesions | 
-----------------+-------------------+---
CFA | | 2 
Iliac | | 1 
Proximal SFA | | 12
Mid SFA | | 30
Popliteal | | 14
Peroneal | | 2 
TP Trunk | | 2 
Anterior Tibial | | 8 
Posterior Tibial | | 1 

 
Although not prespecified in our protocol, we followed 38 subjects from our pivotal study to 180 days after treatment. Using various methods of evaluation, all of the subjects were determined to be free of target lesion revascularization or the need to retreat the lesion.

Because of the lack of prespecification of the collection of the luminal patency data, including method of evaluation, the data would not be sufficient for an atherectomy indication for use. We intend to pursue an expanded indication for use for DABRA for atherectomy procedures to improve luminal patency. We plan to perform a new study designed to allow the FDA to evaluate the DABRA atherectomy procedure.  The first subject is projected to be enrolled and treated in the second quarter of 2019, and we expect to have final results of the trial in the first quarter of 2020. We believe the incremental cost of obtaining the atherectomy indication will not be material. 
 The Pharos Product
 Pharos is a powerful, monochromatic, or single-wavelength, xenon-chlorine, 308 nanometer ultraviolet-B excimer laser used by physicians as a tool to treat chronic skin diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. We launched Pharos in 2004. Pharos does not use heat and does not ablate lesions, and treatments are generally painless. Pharos’ proprietary hand piece features an integrated adjustable spot size and aiming beam that accurately targets only the diseased tissue while sparing the healthy skin from exposure. The laser beam is easily contoured to accommodate the shape of the lesion for fast and precisely targeted treatments with constant fluence, or stream of photons crossing a unit area. No templates or attachments are required. Its flat-top, no hot-spot beam profile delivers uniform dosing for optimal results. Pharos is small enough for most treatment rooms, intuitive to use, and uses a standard 110-volt outlet.
The Pharos Laser
 The Pharos treatment is generally performed in a dermatology treatment room in an office, clinic or hospital. In most states and countries in which we have received regulatory approval, the treatment can be applied by a nurse or technician. The laser is calibrated, the desired dose is entered, and the hand piece is directed to the patient. The treatment is delivered through a hand piece that has a distance gauge which is placed on the patients’ skin and is operated by a foot switch. The hand piece is moved to the appropriate lesion location and the process is repeated until all of the lesions have been dosed.
 We believe that the principal benefits of Pharos are:
  
• | Wavelength. Studies have shown that the action spectrum, or the rate of a physiological activity plotted against wavelength of light, for immunologically modulated skin disorders is centered at about 308 nanometers. Pharos is a 308 nanometer laser, making it ideally suited for use as a tool in the treatment of these disorders. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Energy. The energy from excimer lasers has been shown, in both in vivo and in vitro studies, to have almost four times the T-cell apoptosis generation than non-laser sources. Pharos is a pulsed laser capable of producing very high peak powers and we believe that this may produce an immunosuppressive effect. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collimation. Ultraviolet-B light has a very shallow penetration into the skin, typically less than 100 microns. Although the skin tends to scatter the light, collimation, or keeping the light rays parallel, helps prevent reflection and improves the dose delivery. Pharos has a moderately collimated beam and this collimation allows for treatment in intertriginous areas, such as the groin and armpits, and mucosal areas, such as the mouth and ears, without compromising dose. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 14


 
• | Targeting. Applying the laser energy only to the diseased tissue not only spares the healthy tissue from exposure, but also allows the operator to increase the dose to the affected areas. We believe that Pharos is the only system that has an integrated adjustable spot size offering continuous beam adjustment from a large square to a small circle. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Footprint. Dermatological treatment rooms are small and often crowded with other equipment. Pharos has a small footprint and is among the lightest excimer lasers currently marketed, allowing physicians to conserve space and easily move the system. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are essentially three main types of current treatments for dermatological skin disorders, which each have limitations, as listed below:
  
• | Topical therapies. These can include corticosteroids, vitamin D3 derivatives, coal tar, anthralin and retinoids, among others, that are sold as a cream, gel, liquid, spray, or ointment. The efficacy of topical agents varies from person to person, and these products are commonly associated with poor compliance or side effects that include irritation, redness, and thinning of the skin. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phototherapy. There are several ultraviolet lamp systems that deliver ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B light for the treatment of skin conditions. Broadband ultraviolet therapy can be less desirable than targeted laser machines due to exposure of non-diseased skin and limited ability to deliver high intensity light, requiring more treatment sessions and increasing cancer risk. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Systemic medications including biologics. There are a number of prescription medications available, which are delivered orally or by injection. Generally, these drugs are administered only after both topical treatments and phototherapy have failed, or for people who have severe disease. Some of the side effects include risks of infection or death. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dermatological Disease
 Dermatological disease refers to diseases of the skin caused by imbalance in the physiological condition of the skin. There are over 3,000 different skin conditions and diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, and atopic dermatitis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes cells to rapidly accumulate and affects the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches, or flares, which are itchy and sometimes painful. There is no known cure and multiple rounds of treatments are required to bring the disease under control. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition causing the skin to turn white due to the loss of pigment from the melanocytes, cells that produce the pigment melanin, which gives skin color. There is no known cure. However, some medical treatments can reduce the severity of the condition. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic eczematous skin disease, can result in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin.
 Additional proliferative skin disorders include alopecia areata, dyshidrotic eczema, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. Alopecia areata is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. Dyshidrotic eczema is a skin disease characterized by itchy blisters on the palms of the hands and bottoms of the feet. CTCL is a type of cancer of the immune system caused by a mutation of T-cells.
 Market Overview
 Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and vitiligo are common skin disorders throughout the world. The National Psoriasis Foundation reports that psoriasis affects approximately 7.5 million people in the U.S., which accounts for over 2% of the domestic population. Globally, this skin condition is estimated to afflict over 125 million people. Direct and indirect healthcare costs related to psoriasis in the U.S. alone are roughly $11.25 billion annually. Lost time from work accounts for an additional $11.2 billion per year, as the majority of psoriasis patients miss an average of 26 days of work a year due to their disease. Currently, 17.8 million people suffer from atopic dermatitis in the U.S., making it one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases. Vitiligo is a pigmentation disorder that affects 1% to 2% of the population globally. Alopecia areata affects about 2% of the population in the U.S., or about six million people. There are approximately 30,000 CTCL sufferers in North America.

Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell DABRA and Pharos primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, we had a 39-person direct sales force in the U.S. with 35 persons focused on vascular and four persons focused on dermatology. Our sales force is organized by geographic sales territories, and each territory is managed by a sales manager who acts as the primary customer contact. We plan to continue to increase the size of our sales organization to expand our installed unit base and to increase utilization of the DABRA and Pharos. Our initial focus for DABRA is high-volume OBLs. We partner with distributors for DABRA and Pharos in select geographies outside of the U.S.
 Our marketing department currently consists of six professionals. Our marketing program focuses on:
  
• | educating physicians regarding the proper use and application of DABRA and Pharos;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | supporting physicians’ efforts to enhance referral opportunities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improving patient and caregiver awareness of our treatments; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | facilitating national and international marketing programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 We use a targeted marketing approach to introduce our products to the medical marketplace. We primarily target our marketing efforts to practitioners through marketing materials, medical conferences and journals. In addition, we host seminars and webinars where industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using DABRA and Pharos.
 Manufacturing
 We manufacture our excimer lasers and catheters in our approximately 32,000 square foot facility located in Carlsbad, California. Our vertically integrated facility is ISO 13485 certified and is licensed by the state of California to manufacture our sterile single-use catheters in our controlled environments. We specify and source our supplies primarily from U.S.-based manufacturers, contracting with local suppliers to manufacture custom components. We carefully choose our suppliers to ensure that all components meet our quality standards, adhere to all applicable regulations, and meet our supply needs. We inspect, test, and assemble our products under strict manufacturing processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We perform our own final quality control testing of all products before shipment. In addition to primary suppliers, secondary suppliers have been identified for contingency planning purposes for many key components. We audit our suppliers as required by our quality system and the FDA. We believe that our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to produce enough lasers and catheters to meet our current expected demand for at least the next 12 months.
Competition
 The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We face potential competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have longer, more established operating histories, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. Our competitors also include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD or other dermatological diseases. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including product performance and reliability, manufacturing cost, and customer support.
 Vascular blockages are currently treated with angioplasty balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices that include excimer laser ablation. Our major competitors for our vascular solutions include Medtronic plc, Cardiovascular Systems Inc., Boston Scientific Corp., Avinger, Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., including Volcano Corporation and Spectranetics Corporation, Becton Dickinson and Company, including products from the C.R. Bard acquisition, and Abbott Laboratories. We believe that DABRA competes favorably with our competitors’ products in terms of safety, ease of use, utility and cost.
 Dermatological diseases are currently treated with phototherapy, topical therapies, and systemic medications. Our major competitors for our dermatological solutions include The Daavlin Company, National Biological Corp., STRATA Skin Sciences and large pharmaceutical companies producing biologics. We believe Pharos competes favorably with our competitors’ products.

Reimbursement
 Our customers do not receive reimbursement for the purchase of our products. However, procedures performed using DABRA and Pharos are reimbursable using existing CPT codes. At this time the Company believes that the existing CPT codes are generally adequate to describe the procedures using the Company’s products. The Company believes that there is no current need to apply for separate product specific CPT codes. The CPT process is dynamic and changes or interpretations of codes can occur yearly. Sales of DABRA and Pharos in the U.S. depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to our customers for use of our products from third-party payors, such as private health insurers, managed care organizations and government health programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are significant to our operations, as a large percentage of DABRA and Pharos procedure patients are Medicare beneficiaries, and private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies in setting their own payment policies. However, no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy for services and products exists among third-party payors in the U.S. The absence of uniform policies and limits on coverage can create barriers to sale. You should refer to the “Risk factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for risks related to reimbursement.
 Procedures performed using DABRA and Pharos are generally reimbursed using the CPT codes summarized below. The 2019 Medicare non-facility (free-standing OBL catheterization laboratory), facility (hospital outpatient), and facility (physician) reimbursement amounts are included in the table below. The non-facility reimbursement amounts are the payment rates for services performed in the OBL setting. The reimbursement in the non-facility setting captures the physician’s professional fees as well as the OBL technical practice expenses for equipment, supplies and other office expenses.

Market acceptance of the DABRA and Pharos devices is dependent on adequate payment levels from third-party payors to our customers. We receive payment from the provider, facility or other entity that purchases, leases, rents or uses the DABRA or Pharos devices and purchases related supplies. A physician who performs a procedure utilizing either device may be reimbursed separately from a hospital by third-party payors. Under Medicare, the physician would be reimbursed according to the physician’s fee schedule in effect at the time of the procedure. The physician fee schedule also applies when the procedure is performed in a free-standing OBL catheterization laboratory. When the procedure is performed in a hospital outpatient setting, the hospital would be reimbursed according to the outpatient hospital prospective payment system, based on ambulatory payment classification groups.
 Reimbursement to facilities and physicians can vary substantially depending on the third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies and other factors. For example, the type and geographical location of the facility in which the procedure was performed may impact the level of reimbursement. In addition, the specific use of the product may impact reimbursement. For example, the Pharos treatment of psoriasis is reimbursable by Medicare and nearly all major insurance companies under three CPT codes that differ based on the size of the affected area to be treated. As a result, there is wide variability in reimbursement, and third-party payor’s reimbursement policies are subject to change. Further, requests for reimbursement are subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 Research and Development
 The major focus of our research and development team is to leverage our existing technology platform for new applications and improvements to our existing applications. Future research and development efforts will involve continued enhancements to and cost reductions for DABRA and Pharos. We will also explore the development of other products that can be derived from our core technology platform and intellectual property. Our research and development team works together with our sales force to set development priorities based on communicated customer needs. The feedback received from our customers is reviewed and evaluated for incorporation into new products. We recognized $2.8 million and $4.5 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Patents and Proprietary Technology
 Patents
 In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. The protection of intellectual property has been and remains a priority for us. As of December 31, 2018, we own four issued patents and continue to pursue patent protection in five different patent families. In the patent family titled “Small Flexible Liquid Core Catheter for Laser Ablation in Body Lumens and Methods for Use,” we own one issued U.S. patent, one issued Chinese patent and one granted European patent. A U.S. divisional application has also been filed in this patent family and remains pending. In the patent family titled “Methods and Devices for Treatment of Stenosis of Arteriovenous Fistula Shunts,” we own one issued U.S. patent and three divisional applications remain pending in the U.S. A U.S. patent application titled “Laser Ablation Catheters Having Expanded Distal Tip Windows for Efficient Tissue Ablation” is currently pending in addition to a U.S. patent application titled “Catheter Grip Device and Method.” A pending U.S. patent application titled “Liquid Filled Ablation Catheter with Overjacket” has been converted to a pending Japanese national stage application with plans to further convert this application into the national stage in the U.S., China and Europe. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2035 and 2036, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities, and other charges.
Trademarks
 We own or have rights to trademarks that we use in connection with the operation of our business. We own or have rights to trademarks for Ra Medical Systems and our logo as well as other marks such as DABRA and Pharos.
Trade Secrets
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 United States
 In the U.S., medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending pre-market approval applications, or PMAs, issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 The FDCA classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class II devices provide intermediate levels of risk. They are subject to general controls, and some Class II devices must also comply with special controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by FDA before they are marketed.
 Generally, establishments that manufacture devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
 Pre-market Authorization and Notification
 While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a pre-market approval, or PMA, application prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices; or (iii) authorized the device to be marketed through the de novo process, generally applicable for novel Class I or II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices.
510(k) Notification
 Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and limited Class I devices typically follows a 510(k) pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the predicate device. A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications, or a product previously granted de novo authorization. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
 There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special, for certain device modifications; and abbreviated, for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review. The FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt, and abbreviated 510(k)s within 90 days of receipt. Though the FDA has a user fee goal to clear a traditional 510(k) within 90 days of receipt, the clearance pathway for traditional 510(k)s can take substantially longer.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
 19


De Novo Classification
 Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA. This provision allows FDA to classify a low- to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II.
 PMA Approval
 A product not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.
 Results from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of a Class III PMA device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. After completion of the required clinical testing, a PMA including the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, and information relating to the product’s marketing history, design, labeling, manufacture, and controls, is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
 The PMA approval process is generally more expensive, rigorous, lengthy, and uncertain than the 510(k) premarket notification process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of a PMA application typically takes one to three years, but may last longer. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval and/or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.
 Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 Clinical Trials
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a premarket notification. For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the U.S. be approved via an IDE which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specified study centers. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
 20


Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites, and are designed to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device. Clinical trials, for significant and nonsignificant risk devices, must be approved by an institutional review board, or IRB – an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial it has approved to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. Investigational devices may only be distributed for use in an investigation, and must bear a label with the statement: “CAUTION—Investigational device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.”
 Postmarket Requirements
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA). In addition, we are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA, EMA, or similar foreign governmental authorities if one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if we become aware that it has malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred. After a May 2018 inspection, the FDA issued to us a Form 483 that included observations for failure to properly evaluate whether certain complaints related to Pharos and DABRA that we have received rose to a level required to be reported to the FDA. In response, we informed the FDA that we have modified our complaint review procedures and we completed a retrospective evaluation and have not found any complaints which require a submission to the FDA. Failure to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, can subject us to sanctions and penalties, including warning letters and recalls.
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in or are inconsistent with the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet.
 The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding use of their products, and if we promote our products beyond their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement actions or prosecution arising from that off-label promotion. Violations of the FDCA relating to the inappropriate promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.

For a PMA or Class II 510(k) or de novo device, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to QSRs after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with QSRs. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements. The FDA has the authority to conduct mandatory recalls, but that authority is rarely used.
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as:
  
• | fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | recall or seizure of products;
--+-------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 We have received 510(k) premarket clearances from the FDA to market our excimer laser and catheter systems for treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, leukoderma, and for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. We expect to file additional 510(k) submissions for other diseases including, but not limited to, CAD, alopecia areata, and oral lichen planus in the future.
 Radiation Emitting Products
 For all radiation emitting devices, additional requirements apply under the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the FDCA. Electronic product radiation means (i) any ionizing, or non-ionizing electromagnetic or particulate radiation, or (ii) any sonic, infrasonic, or ultrasonic wave emitted from an electronic product as the result of the operation of an electronic circuit in the product. The additional regulations on these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary radiation exposure emitted by these products. These requirements include compliance with applicable radiation safety performance standards and additional reporting to the FDA. The performance standards for lasers include specific user labeling requirements, radiation limitations, and technological requirements for certain safety features.
Non U.S. Regulatory
 We have additional clearances from China, from both the CFDA and State Food and Drug Administration, or sFDA, and Korea, from the MDFS. In addition, we also received CE mark for the Pharos dermatological and DABRA vascular system in the third quarter of 2016, enabling our product launch in Europe. The FDA clearances and the CE mark also allow us to sell these products in other large markets.

Other Healthcare Laws
 Our business operations and current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, consultants, customers and patients, expose us to broadly applicable state and federal fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws constrain the business and financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products. Such laws include:

• | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a U.S. healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the health care fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 2022, we will also be required to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and

• | analogous state and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by the patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that some of our business practices, including our promotional activities and interactions with our customers do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
International Laws
 In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
 There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 In the U.S. and some non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.

Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, in the U.S., in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers. Among the ACA’s provisions of importance to our business are the following:
  
• | implementation of a 2.3% excise tax imposed on manufacturers and importers for certain sales of medical devices, which, due to subsequent legislation will not go into effect until January 1, 2020;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the 2.3% excise tax imposed on manufacturers and importers for certain sales of medical devices, the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, and the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Additionally, individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 118 full-time employees. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management systems, recruit and train new employees and select qualified independent contractors. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
