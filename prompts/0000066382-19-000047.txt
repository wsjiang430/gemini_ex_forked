Raw Materials
The Company's manufacturing materials are available from a significant number of sources within North America, South America, Europe and Asia. To date, the Company has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its raw materials. The costs of certain direct materials used in the Company's manufacturing and assembly operations are sensitive to shifts in commodity market prices. In particular, the costs of steel, plastic, aluminum components and particleboard are sensitive to the market prices of commodities such as raw steel, aluminum, crude oil, lumber and resins. Increases in the market prices for these commodities can have an adverse impact on the Company's profitability. Further information regarding the impact of direct material costs on the Company's financial results is provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this report, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Etc.
The Company has active utility and design patents in the United States. Many of the inventions covered by these patents also have been patented in a number of foreign countries. Various trademarks, including the name and stylized “Herman Miller” and the “Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M” trademark are registered in the United States and many foreign countries. The Company does not believe that any material part of its business depends on the continued availability of any one or all of its patents or trademarks, or that its business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any such marks, except for the following trademarks: Herman Miller®, Herman Miller Circled Symbolic M®, Maharam®, Geiger®, Design Within Reach®, DWR®, Nemschoff®, Action Office®, Living Office®, Ethospace®, Aeron®, Mirra®, Embody®, Setu®, Sayl®, Cosm®, Eames®, PostureFit®, Meridian®, and Canvas Office Landscape®.
Working Capital Practices
Information concerning the Company's inventory levels relative to its sales volume can be found under the Executive Overview section in Item 7 of this report “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Beyond this discussion, the Company does not believe that it or the industry in general has any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding the Company's business.
Customer Base
The Company estimates that no single dealer accounted for more than 5 percent of the Company's net sales in the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019. The Company estimates that the largest single end-user customer accounted for $129.6 million, $109.8 million and $102.3 million of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. This represents approximately 5 percent of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company's 10 largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 18 percent, 19 percent, and 18 percent of net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Backlog of Unfilled Orders
As of June 1, 2019, the Company's backlog of unfilled orders was $394.2 million. At June 2, 2018, the Company's backlog totaled $350.7 million. It is expected that substantially all the orders forming the backlog at June 1, 2019, will be filled during the next fiscal year. Many orders received by the Company are reflected in the backlog for only a short period while other orders specify delayed shipments and are carried in the backlog for up to one year. Accordingly, the amount of the backlog at any particular time does not necessarily indicate the level of net sales for a particular succeeding period.
Government Contracts
Other than standard provisions contained in contracts with the United States Government, the Company does not believe that any significant portion of its business is subject to material renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of various government entities. The Company sells to the U.S. Government both through a General Services Administration ("GSA") Multiple Award Schedule Contract and through competitive bids. The GSA Multiple Award Schedule Contract pricing is principally based upon the Company's commercial price list in effect when the contract is initiated, rather than being determined on a cost-plus-basis. The Company is required to receive GSA approval to apply list price increases during the term of the Multiple Award Schedule Contract period.
Competition
All aspects of the Company's business are highly competitive. From an office furniture perspective, the Company competes largely on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery and product pricing. Although the Company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the world, it competes with manufacturers that have significant resources and sales as well as many smaller companies. The Company's most significant competitors are Haworth, HNI Corporation, Kimball International, Knoll and Steelcase. 
Herman Miller, Inc. and Subsidiaries  3

The Company also competes in the home furnishings industry, primarily against national, regional and independent home furnishings retailers who market high-craft furniture to end-user customers and the interior design community. These competitors include companies such as Restoration Hardware and Wayfair. Similar to its office furniture product offerings, the Company competes primarily on design, product and service quality, speed of delivery and product pricing in this consumer market.
Research, Design and Development
The Company believes it draws great competitive strength from its research, design and development programs. Through research, the Company seeks to understand, define and clarify customer needs and problems they are trying to solve. The Company designs innovative products and services that address customer needs and solve their problems. The Company uses both internal and independent research resources and independent design resources. Exclusive of royalty payments, the Company spent approximately $58.8 million, $57.1 million and $58.6 million on research and development activities in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Generally, royalties are paid to designers of the Company's products as the products are sold and are included in the Design and Research line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
Environmental Matters
For over 50 years, respecting the environment has been more than good business practice for the Company - it is the right thing to do. The Company's 10-year sustainability strategy - Earthright - begins with three principles: positive transparency, products as living things and becoming greener together. The Company's goals are focused around the smart use of resources, eco-inspired design and being community driven. Based on current facts known to management, the Company does not believe that existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, there can be no assurance that environmental legislation and technology in this area will not result in or require material capital expenditures or additional costs to our manufacturing process.
Human Resources
The Company considers its employees to be another of its major competitive strengths. The Company stresses individual employee participation and incentives, believing that this emphasis has helped attract and retain a competent and motivated workforce. The Company's human resources group provides employee recruitment, education and development, as well as compensation planning and counseling. Additionally, there have been no work stoppages or labor disputes in the Company's history. As of June 1, 2019, approximately 5 percent of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of whom are employees of its Nemschoff and Herman Miller Holdings Limited subsidiaries.
As of June 1, 2019, the Company had approximately 8,000 employees, representing a 4 percent increase as compared with June 2, 2018. In addition to its employee workforce, the Company uses temporary labor to meet uneven demand in its manufacturing operations.
