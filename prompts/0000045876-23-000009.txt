OUR COMPANY - OUR VISION
Harsco Corporation is a market-leading, global provider of environmental solutions for industrial and specialty waste streams. Our two reportable business segments are Harsco Environmental and Harsco Clean Earth and we are a single-thesis environmental solutions company that is a leader in the markets we serve.
We have worked in recent years to both transform our portfolio and strengthen our financial results, and we have invested to achieve these objectives and to grow the Company. These investments include targeted organic investments, as well as mergers and acquisitions, that have accelerated our business transformation. The purchases of Clean Earth and ESOL, along with the sale of our energy-linked business in 2019 and our plan to sell our Rail business, have been significant strategic steps for our Company. As a result, 100% of our revenues from continuing operations in 2022 and 2021 were generated from our two environmentally-focused segments. It also is important to note that these transactions have reduced the Company’s portfolio complexity and business cyclicality.
More broadly, we are committed to viewing every customer need through a sustainability lens. Our customers are increasingly expecting more customizable solutions that address environmental challenges within their industries. The Company is responding to this need by helping our customers build better businesses and, in a larger sense, a better environment. Our go-forward strategy is clear: to continue building a leading, global environmental solutions company.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company’s current operations consist of two reportable business segments: Harsco Environmental and Harsco Clean Earth. Until the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company reported the Harsco Rail Segment. The Company previously announced its plan to sell the Harsco Rail business and the sale process is ongoing. Historical results for Harsco Rail are accounted for as discontinued operations. 
The Company reports segment information using the “management approach,” based on the way management organizes and reports the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions, assessing performance and allocating capital. The Company’s reporting segments are identified based upon differences in products, services, and markets served. Financial information concerning segments and international and domestic operations is included in Note 16, Information by Segment and Geographic Area, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our revenues by business segment are as follows, and a further description of the products and services offered through these business segments is presented below.
HARSCO ENVIRONMENTAL
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our Harsco Environmental Segment can trace its heritage back to the earliest efforts in industrial recycling and environmental resource management. Where others only saw waste and expense, we saw opportunity and value nearly 100 years ago. HE was founded upon market insights, grounded in respect for the environment, efficient use of resources, and optimism for the future. 
Today, HE is a premier, global provider of environmental services and material processing to the global steel and metals industries. HE partners with its global customer base to deliver production-critical on-site operational support and resource recovery services, through management of our customers’ primary waste or byproduct streams. Our services support the metal manufacturing process, generating significant operational and financial efficiencies for our customers and allowing them to focus on their core steelmaking businesses. 
HE serves approximately 70 mill services customers at approximately 150 sites in approximately 30 countries. Our diversified customer base includes the largest steel producers in the regions where we operate, serving a mix of mini-mill and integrated operations. In recent years, HE has greatly extended its reach, signing new services contracts in bellwether emerging markets like India, and further strengthening our footprint in the Americas and Europe. As a result, our global portfolio is balanced and diversified, with foreign currency risk partially mitigated by the fact that our operating costs and revenues are regularly denominated in local currencies.
In addition to providing critical services to our customers, we provide zero-waste solutions for relevant waste or byproduct streams - an important component of our value proposition. We repurpose processed material for alternative uses and / or convert this material into viable products to be sold in other markets via our ecoproducts™ offerings and capabilities. Our ecoproductsTM portfolio includes road and roofing materials, abrasives, agriculture products and aggregates. This expertise is increasingly important to our customers as environmental regulations increase and the marketplace grows more averse to landfilling waste. 
CUSTOMERS AND SERVICE CONTRACTS
We offer our customers a suite of more than 30 services, and our on-site work is performed under long-term contracts. These contracts typically include fixed fees or minimum billings, which de-risk our investment during periods of economic weakness, and variable fees often linked to the amount of metal produced or waste processed at a site. Our variable fees under contracts are, importantly, not linked to steel prices. Additionally, in recent years, we have strengthened our contract terms and underwriting practices in an effort to earn a sufficient and timely return on our investments, as well as achieve other objectives. These measures, along with various improvement initiatives, have boosted our site portfolio results and driven more consistent performance across our operations.
Our contract renewal rates are high, with many customer relationships that span decades. Our largest customers today include ArcelorMittal, Gerdau, Tata Steel Group, Tisco, and Hebei Iron and Steel Company. We serve most of our major customers at multiple sites, often under multiple contracts. The length of our customer relationships reflects our value proposition. Customers choose the Company to (1) achieve operational and financial efficiencies; (2) concentrate their efforts on metal manufacturing and supporting end-market product demands; (3) gain access to process innovations and technologies developed by the Company; and (4) leverage our downstream product applications and know-how. HE had one customer in each of the past three years that provided more than 10% of this segment's revenues, again under many long-term contracts at multiple sites. 
On December 31, 2022, the Company's service contracts had estimated future revenues of $3.3 billion at current production levels, an increase of $0.2 billion from 2021, excluding foreign currency translation impacts, which is driven by new and renewed contracts. These contract values provide the Company with a substantial base of anticipated long-term revenues. Approximately 20% of these revenues are expected to be recognized by December 31, 2023; approximately 41% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2026; approximately 21% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2027 and December 31, 2029; and the remaining revenues are expected to be recognized thereafter. Estimated future revenues are exclusive of anticipated contract renewals, projected volume increases and ad-hoc services, as well as future revenues from roofing granules, abrasives products, roadmaking materials, additives and specialty recovery technology services.
ON-SITE SERVICES
HE provides a broad range of services, most of which address our customers’ environmental challenges. In total, these services reduce both landfill waste and the carbon footprint of our customers’ sites. In 2022, on-site services represented approximately 85% of HE’s revenues. A summary of our most significant services is as follows:
Resource Recovery, Metal Recycling and Slag Optimization
Resource recovery, metal recycling and slag optimization is the core component of our service offerings. We capture liquid steel waste or byproduct (slag) and transport it for cooling, treatment and conditioning. We then recover valuable metal from the waste-stream, which is returned to our customer in a form suitable for recycling through the customers’ manufacturing process. Finally, the residual non-metallic processed material is transformed into environmental products that create new and additional revenue streams.
Scrap Management
We manage customer scrap inventories and upgrade scrap by making it cleaner and denser. Improved scrap characteristics reduce electricity usage which, combined with the usage of recycled material, provides sustainability benefits to our customers.
Materials Handling and Logistics
We transport materials, including semi-finished and finished products, safely and efficiently for our customers. Our tracking technology also provides real-time analysis of material location, quantities and product quality.
Meltshop and Furnace Services
Meltshop and furnace services allow the molten metal production process to run smoothly and efficiently. These services include under-vessel cleaning and the removal of ladle slag (waste) and general melt shop debris. 
ECOPRODUCTS™
HE creates value-added downstream products from industrial waste-streams. Our experience in manufacturing these products and successfully penetrating relevant end-markets is an important differentiator for the Company. These zero-waste solutions preserve our natural resources and reduce or eliminate landfill disposal. Ecoproducts in 2022 represented approximately 14% of HE’s revenues, and our major ecoproducts include the following:
Road Surfacing and Materials
Because of its natural shape and interlocking properties, steel slag holds many advantages when used in asphalt roadway surfaces, ranging from high skid resistance to better durability.  The Company’s slag-based asphalt product, developed and sold as SteelPhalt™, maintains positive surface characteristics throughout the life of the road, allowing longer replacement intervals and lower maintenance costs. In 2022, SteelPhalt™ launched a carbon-negative asphalt product, using a renewable bio-based substance to bind the asphalt. This is an alternative to bitumen and reduces the product's carbon footprint. The Company also sells a slag aggregate that is a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to natural stone. This aggregate is often used as unbound road base material for secondary roads and sub-base material elsewhere.
Abrasives and Roofing Materials
Our Reed Minerals business is among the largest roofing granule suppliers in the U.S., partnering with the country's leading shingle manufacturers. Nearly 100 years ago, we pioneered a process of recycling coal combustion waste from power plants. Through the Company's proprietary process, we create premium quality roofing granules that are a critical raw material in asphalt roofing shingles. 
Reed is also one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of abrasives, using coal, as well as copper and nickel slag, and crushed glass, for the surface preparation market. Our BLACK BEAUTY®  and SURE/CUT™ abrasives are well-recognized within the industry and are used as blast material to remove paint, rust, and other coatings from surfaces, prior to applying a new finish. 
Metallurgical Additives
The Company’s custom-designed steelmaking additives facilitate fluid slag formation in the steelmaking process, thus improving customer productivity and helping achieve the steel product specifications required for today’s premium applications.
Agriculture and Turf Products
We produce soil conditioners and fertilizers, principally from stainless steel slag that optimize crop yields and turf performance. CrossOver® and AgrowSil® products are our leading silicon, calcium and magnesium-based product brands, sold mainly in the Americas. These products are formulated to address nutrient deficiencies and toxicity issues in soil as well as to help plants withstand outside pressures and disease.
Cement Additives
Steel slag is naturally cementitious and commonly blended with other materials to produce environmentally-friendly, high-performing cement products. Cement made with slag aggregate can achieve permeabilities and other attributes that compare favorably to concrete made with conventional aggregates.
ALTEK GROUP
Altek is a UK-based manufacturer of market-leading products that enable aluminum producers and recyclers to manage and extract value from critical waste streams, reduce waste generation, and improve operating productivity. The cost-efficient recovery of metal and other valuable materials is increasingly important to the aluminum industry. Altek’s products and technologies address this challenge, and its AluSalt® innovation offers customers an innovative technology that converts salt slag waste into valuable products, addressing one of the largest environmental concerns within the aluminum market.
GROWTH STRATEGY
We have identified attractive opportunities that meet our return thresholds to expand our service portfolio, and our pipeline of opportunities remains significant. Additionally, we have initiated efforts to expand our downstream products business and plan to continue investing in innovation to support our business sustainability. 
A summary of our key growth initiatives is as follows:
•Further Penetrate Existing Sites. Given our broad services capabilities, we see potential for add-on services contracts at existing sites.
•New Sites. We continue to pursue new services contracts in certain markets, particularly in emerging economies where out-sourcing opportunities are significant because of increased environmental awareness or where steel consumption (production) is set to grow.
•Investment in Downstream Products. We see opportunities to expand certain products businesses, and our investment in new SteelPhalt™ (road materials) plants in Europe is a recent example.
•Innovation. We are at the forefront of innovation in our industry. Our innovation programs are specifically focused on helping our customers solve their most pressing environmental challenges amid ever-increasing regulation. This initiative includes developing new customer or industry solutions, either in-house or externally, and expanding the usage of technologies that already exist within our business.
COMPETITORS
HE competes principally with a small number of privately-held businesses for services outsourced by customers on a global basis. We also compete with numerous smaller, privately-held businesses in each of our regional markets and, to some degree, customers that may decide to perform certain services themselves.
We believe that HE differentiates itself from its competition through innovative technologies that support our service offerings, and through the operating expertise developed by sharing best practices across our global portfolio. Our safety practices and performance also support our business, as do our long-standing relationships and our downstream product solutions.
HARSCO CLEAN EARTH
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our Harsco Clean Earth segment provides specialty waste processing, treatment, recycling, and beneficial reuse solutions for customers in the industrial, retail, healthcare, and construction industries across a variety of waste needs, including hazardous, non-hazardous, and contaminated soils and dredged materials. CE currently operates 18 RCRA Part B permitted TSDFs, wastewater treatment facilities and supporting 10-day transfer facilities across the U.S., serving more than 90,000 customer locations, while utilizing a fleet of over 700 vehicles. It also holds a portfolio of more than 500 critically-important permits, and the waste handled by CE is recycled or beneficially reused. 
Specialty-waste permits have considerable value, and CE is positioned to take advantage of increasingly stringent regulations on the handling of this waste. These dynamics provide recurring revenues and support attractive underlying growth. CE also operates in a fragmented market where acquisition opportunities are likely to develop. As a result, we see CE as a platform for growth as we continue to expand our focus as an environmental solutions company.
CUSTOMERS
CE provides regulatory-compliant solutions with a high quality of customer service to a diverse set of customers. These customers include waste generators in numerous industries, including chemicals, power, aerospace, medical, retail and metals, as well as integrated waste companies and brokers. CE also services federal, state and local governments as well as developers linked to large infrastructure and redevelopment projects. CE had one customer in 2022 and 2021 that provided more than 10% of this segment's revenues.
LINES OF BUSINESS
Hazardous Waste
CE provides testing, tracking, processing, recycling, and disposal services for hazardous waste and it operates 18 RCRA Part B permitted TSDFs and several wastewater processing permits that enable the Company to process a variety of complex hazardous wastes, consisting of toxic, reactive and flammable materials such as industrial wastewater, manufacturing sludge, oily-mixtures, chemicals, pesticides, asbestos, pharmaceutical waste, and landfill leachate with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"). The remaining facilities handle a limited number of other wastes, including electronics, batteries and light bulbs. These operations possess unique and differentiated processing technologies, such as applications for aerosol can, medical waste recycling, fuel blending, household hazardous waste and lead contaminated soils. In 2022, this line of business represented approximately 82% of CE’s revenues.
Soil and Dredged Materials
CE processes approximately 3.2 million tons per year of contaminated soil and 0.4 million cubic yards of dredged material at sixteen locations, which includes fixed-based locations and mobile plants. These soils are contaminated with heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides, PFAS or other chemicals, and the related clean-up work is often the result of infrastructure improvements, private redevelopment, industrial site remediation and/or underground storage tank removal. CE treats and recycles this soil through various processes, after which the material is suitable for beneficial reuse as construction fill material or landfill capping. CE also operates one facility to treat dredged material, the sediment accumulated at the bottom of waterways that is removed for environmental (clean-up) or maintenance (maintain depth) purposes. After treatment, these materials are also beneficially reused as fill material. In 2022, this line of business represented approximately 18% of CE’s revenues.
OPERATIONS AND PERMITS
CE provides a suite of regulation-compliant treatment solutions for hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that can be tailored to
meet customer-specific requirements. The solutions include soil remediation and recycling including thermal desorption, dredged material stabilization and beneficial reuse, hazardous and non-hazardous waste stabilization and solidification, fuel blending, management and recycling, battery and electronic waste recycling, and secure electronic data destruction.
Additionally, CE holds a portfolio of more than 500 process, treatment and operating permits, including the ones mentioned above. This permit portfolio is difficult to duplicate, making these permits valuable and critically-important assets in this heavily-regulated industry. CE’s ability to secure new permits or permit modifications for new waste streams or processes in the future remains an important growth lever for the business.
GROWTH
Favorable underlying market dynamics, driven by increased regulation and a growing list of contaminants and hazardous materials, and investment are anticipated to fuel CE’s growth in the coming years. We also anticipate introducing newer technologies into the market with new treatment solutions and expansion of existing technologies, including permit modifications and applications in new geographic markets. Lastly, CE is well-positioned to benefit from a positive outlook for maintenance and environmental dredging, as well as emerging PFAS markets, and over time, we expect acquisitions to be an important growth lever for CE. CE operates in a very fragmented, regionally-driven market, and as a result, we expect to pursue acquisition opportunities that may provide increased scale and/or new capabilities, along with synergies and attractive financial returns to the Company.
COMPETITION
Given the fragmented nature of the specialty waste industry, CE competes with numerous companies. Our larger peers include Clean Harbors, Republic Services, which acquired U.S. Ecology in 2022, Veolia and Heritage Environmental Services within the hazardous materials line of business and GFL Environmental and Impact Environmental within the soil and dredged materials market. CE differentiates itself from competitors through service reliability and responsiveness, its diverse operating capabilities and regulatory compliant solutions, and the value it provides through providing environmentally superior solutions relative to other disposal alternatives in the regions where it operates.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ("ESG")
We are committed to building a global, market-leading environmental solutions company that preserves our environment, adheres to ethical and responsible business practices, and supports our customers as they do the same. ESG is central to our business strategy and operations - our employees are inspired to develop innovative products and services that positively impact the environment and support the Company’s growth.
Our ESG focus areas include:
•Innovative Solutions. We help our customers solve their most pressing sustainability challenges by providing services and products that meet their environmental and business objectives. We deliver solutions for treating, recycling and repurposing materials across a wide range of customers, industries, and industrial by-products and specialty and hazardous wastes, including steel, aluminum, soils, water, electronics, fuel, batteries and more.
•Thriving Environment. We strive to reduce or eliminate our global environmental impacts by providing the highest-quality environmental management in our operations and improving our environmental footprint through continuous improvement efforts. Our Corporate Environmental Policy outlines our environmental stewardship commitments. We also expect all third parties that do business with the Company to share our environmental standards.
•Safe Workplaces. Safety is of paramount importance in everything we do - our goal, each and every day, is that our people return home unharmed. We have built a best-in-class safety culture, and our cross-divisional Executive Safety Committee is responsible for implementing best practices with a goal of eliminating all incidents within our business activities.
•Inspired People. We invest in the career development of our employees, knowing that diversity of perspective, backgrounds and talents strengthens our business. We are also committed to building strong, sustainable communities where we live and work.

Our Code of Conduct and our Core Values lie at the center of all we do. Through these policies and guidelines, we have equipped every employee with the tools, training, and guidance to always do the right things, the right way. Oversight of our ESG practices is provided by the Governance Committee of the Company’s Board. 
Further details on our ESG initiatives and accomplishments can be found in our latest ESG Report. This report, published in October 2022, is our most comprehensive sustainability report to date and can be found on the Company’s website (www.harsco.com/sustainability) along with other related policies. Unless specifically stated herein, documents and information on the Company's website are not incorporated by reference into this document.
HARSCO BUSINESS SYSTEM ("HBS")
Our HBS is a shared set of processes that reflect and support our corporate strategy. These repeatable and replicable standards and practices are the hallmark of a high-performing company. There is intrinsic value in a common language, and a defined business system does away, in large part, with ambiguity about what constitutes success. The elements of our HBS are: 
Environmental, Health & Safety; Continuous Improvement; Talent Development; Strategic Planning; and Acquisitions & Divestitures. 
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Given the Company’s evolution to a single-thesis environmental solutions company, acquisitions and divestitures have been an important element of our business strategy. These actions support the Company’s growth ambitions, while reducing business cyclicality and portfolio complexity.
The Company is in the process of selling the Rail business with a sale expected to occur in 2023. The intention to sell the business was first announced in the fourth quarter of 2021. The sales process was delayed in 2022 due to certain macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates. Rail is reclassified as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations for all years presented. 
In June 2019, the Company acquired Clean Earth which provided the Company entry into the specialty waste market. In April 2020, the Company acquired ESOL, an established waste transportation, processing and services provider with a comprehensive portfolio of disposal solutions for customers across industrial, retail and healthcare markets. The acquisition of ESOL furthered our transformation into a market-leading, single-thesis environmental solutions platform. Clean Earth and ESOL combined to form Harsco Clean Earth. 
SEASONALITY
The Company's businesses can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for services and solutions provided by HE are subject to seasonal changes related to weather conditions, inventory management through the steel-industry supply chain, and customer operating outages. The timing of these impacts varies by region, however, overall customer demand for HE across its global footprint tend to be strongest in the second quarter and third quarter of each year. CE, meanwhile, provides services that can also fluctuate seasonally with weather, construction activity, industrial production, retail spending and municipal waste collection programs. As a result, demand for CE services tends to be weakest in the first and fourth quarters of each year. 
Due to these factors, the Company’s revenues and earnings are usually higher during the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth quarter of the year. Additionally, the Company’s cash flows are also influenced by seasonality. The Company’s cash flow from operations has historically been higher in the second half of the year, compared with the first half, due to working capital management, receivable collections during the fourth quarter as a result of higher revenues in preceding quarters and the timing of certain cash payments in the first half of the year, including for incentive compensation and pension contributions.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
The Company is subject to various environmental regulations within its global operations, and the scope of relevant environmental regulation expanded following the Company’s acquisition of Clean Earth and ESOL in 2019 and 2020, respectively. CE operates within an industry that is subject to stringent environmental regulations by federal, state and local authorities, which regulate the treatment and disposal of specialty waste. Facility and operating permits, or approvals from these authorities, are required to maintain operations. The nature of these permits varies by jurisdiction and are based on the activities at a particular site. These permits are generally difficult to obtain. This dynamic, along with increased regulation on the treatment and disposal of specialty waste, is beneficial to our CE business.
The most significant U.S. federal environmental regulation that impacts our business is the RCRA. RCRA created a cradle-to-grave system which governs the transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. Under RCRA, each hazardous waste processing facility must maintain a RCRA permit and comply with defined operating practices. This legislation is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), although its authority may be delegated to a State EPA with similar or more stringent environmental standards.
The Company is also subject to air and water quality control legislation in the U.S. and in foreign countries where the Company operates. The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into waterways and sewers in the U.S, and, where necessary, we obtain and must comply with permits to discharge wastewater from our facilities. Similarly, the Clean Air Act in the U.S. controls emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits for certain emissions.
The Company regards compliance with all applicable environmental regulations as critical to its business. Historically, the Company has been able to renew and retain all required permits to maintain its operations, and it has not experienced substantial difficulty complying with relevant environmental regulations. The Company also does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures to comply with, or improve, environmental performance in the future. While environmental regulations may increase or expand, we cannot predict the extent of this future environmental regulation, its related costs and the overall effect on the Company’s business.
For additional information regarding environmental matters see Note 12, Commitment and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

We evaluate our safety processes, programs and procedures to continuously improve our safety performance. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs globally.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by employee level and by the country where the employees are located, may include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, retirement programs, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid-time off, paid parental leave, disability programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
Diversity, Equity, Engagement and Inclusion
Diversity, equity, engagement, and inclusion (“DEE&I”) is an integral part of the Company’s values and processes that support recruitment, hiring, training, retention and advancement. In an effort to advance the Company’s commitment to DEE&I, the Company has taken the following initiatives:
•A DEE&I Council was previously established, which is co-chaired by our CEO and Senior Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer and is comprised of 10 cross-functional leaders from each of our business units. The DEE&I Council is accountable for directly shaping and promoting the Company’s DEE&I strategy and key initiatives, focusing on improving employee retention.
•In 2022, the Company's Employee Resource Group, Women of Harsco, whose mission is to promote the advancement of women across the Company through personal and professional development, mentorship, and empowerment, expanded its reach to India, piloted a mentorship program that ensures effective mentor/mentee pairing, initiated a speaker series to spark discussions around leadership and tips for success and began community outreach efforts to promote career exploration for girls and young women.
•Continued to include DEE&I focused goals in key management's incentive compensation program. 
Talent Development and Succession
We believe our development processes ensure continuity of leadership over the long term. Thus, annually we undertake a talent review process to access the organizational capabilities required to execute our strategy, create tailored development plans and understand the depth of our succession preparedness.  Our objective is to build the readiness of various talent pools within the organization in order to select and promote key talent. In addition, we continue to invest in our employees through technical training, professional development and skills upgrade throughout the year.
