ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 The Gorman-Rupp Company (Registrant, Gorman-Rupp, the Company, we or our) was incorporated in Ohio in 1934. The Company designs, manufactures and globally sells pumps and pump systems for use in water, wastewater, construction, dewatering, industrial, petroleum, original equipment, agriculture, fire protection, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), military and other liquid-handling applications. 
 PRODUCTS 
 The Company operates in one business segment, the manufacture and sale of pumps and pump systems. The following table sets forth, for the years 2016 through 2018, the total net sales, income before income taxes and year-end total assets of the Company.

 The Companys product line consists of pump models ranging in size from 1/4 to nearly 15 feet and ranging in rated capacity from less than one gallon per minute to nearly one million gallons per minute. The types of pumps which the Company produces include self-priming centrifugal, standard centrifugal, magnetic drive centrifugal, axial and mixed-flow, vertical turbine line shaft, submersible, high-pressure booster, rotary gear, diaphragm, bellows and oscillating.

 The pumps have drives that range from 1/35 horsepower electric motors up to much larger electric motors or internal combustion engines capable of producing several thousand horsepower. Many of the larger units comprise encased, fully-integrated water and wastewater pumping stations. In certain cases, units are designed for the inclusion of customer-supplied drives. 
 The Companys larger pumps are sold principally for use in the construction, industrial, water and wastewater handling fields; for flood control; for boosting low residential water pressure; for pumping refined petroleum products, including the ground refueling of aircraft; for fluid control in HVAC applications; and for various agricultural purposes. 
 The Companys pumps are also utilized for dewatering purposes. Additionally, pumps manufactured for fire protection are used for sprinkler back-up systems, fire hydrants, stand pipes, fog systems and deluge systems at hotels, banks, factories, airports, schools, public buildings and hundreds of other types of facilities throughout the world. 
 Many of the Companys smallest pumps are sold to customers for incorporation into such products as food processing, chemical processing, photo processing, medical applications, waste treatment, HVAC equipment, appliances and solar heating. 
 MARKETING 
 The Companys pumps are marketed in the United States and worldwide through a broad network of distributors, through manufacturers representatives (for sales to many original equipment manufacturers), through third-party distributor catalogs, direct sales, and by ecommerce. The Company regularly seeks alliances with distributors and other partners to further enhance marketing opportunities. Export sales are made primarily through foreign distributors and representatives. The Company has long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets it serves and provides specialized training programs to distributors on a regular basis. 
 During 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no shipments to any single customer that exceeded 10% of total net sales. Gorman-Rupp continued to actively pursue international business opportunities and, in 2018, shipped its pumps to approximately 145 countries around the world. No sales made to customers in any one foreign country amounted to more than 5% of total net sales for 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
 Approximately $142.5 million of 2018 sales were shipped outside the United States, as compared to $137.6 million in 2017 and $131.2 million in 2016. International sales represented 34% of total net sales in year 2018, 36% of total net sales in year 2017 and 34% of total net sales in year 2016. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Business Segment Information. The Company continued its efforts to penetrate international markets principally by its increased global investments and its focus on meeting the worlds water and wastewater pumping needs. 
 COMPETITION 
 The pump industry is highly fragmented and therefore Gorman-Rupp competes with a large number of businesses. Numerous pump competitors exist as subsidiaries, divisions or departments within significantly larger corporations. The Company also faces increased competition from foreign-sourced pumps in most of the Companys domestic markets. 
 Most commercial and industrial pumps are specifically designed and engineered for a particular customers application. The Company believes that proper application, product performance, and quality of delivery and service are its principal methods of competition, and attributes its success to its continued emphasis in these areas. In the sale of products and services, the Company benefits from its large base of previously installed products, which periodically require replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate.

 PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION 
 Substantially all of the materials, supplies, components and accessories used by the Company in the fabrication of its products, including all castings (for which most patterns are made and owned by the Company), structural steel, bar stock, motors, solenoids, engines, seals, and plastic and elastomeric components are purchased by the Company from other suppliers and manufacturers. The Company does not purchase materials under long-term contracts and is not dependent upon a single source for any materials, supplies, components or accessories which are of material importance to its business. 
 The Company purchases motor components for its large submersible pumps, and motors and engines for its pump systems, from a limited number of suppliers, while motors for its polypropylene bellows pumps and magnetic drive pumps are purchased from several alternative vendors. Products requiring small motors are also sourced from alternative suppliers. 
 The other production operations of the Company consist of the machining of castings, the cutting, shaping and welding of bar stock and structural members, the design and assembly of electrical control panels, the manufacture of some small motors and a few minor components, and the assembling, painting and testing of its products. Substantially all of the Companys products are tested prior to shipment. 
 OTHER ASPECTS 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed approximately 1,200 persons, of whom approximately 670 were hourly employees. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements, has never experienced a work stoppage and considers its labor relations to be satisfactory. 
 Although the Company owns a number of patents, several of which are important to its business, the Company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any one or more patents. The Companys patents, trademarks and other intellectual property are adequate for its business purposes. 
 The Companys backlog of orders was $113.7 million at December 31, 2018 and essentially unchanged compared to $114.0 million at December 31, 2017. Approximately 96% of the Companys backlog of unfilled orders is scheduled to be shipped during 2019, with the remainder principally during the first half of 2020. Incoming orders increased 5.7% in 2018 compared to 2017 and included increases in almost all the markets the Company serves, most notably in the municipal, construction, petroleum and industrial markets.
