This segment manufactures differentiated, proprietary products, most of which have been internally developed. These internally developed products include materials, printing systems, and software. IDS competes for business on several factors, including customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, price, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Competition is highly fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering minimal product variety, to some of the world's largest adhesive and electrical product companies offering competing products as part of their overall product lines.
 ID Solutions serves customers in many industries, which include industrial manufacturing, electronic manufacturing, healthcare, chemical, oil, gas, automotive, aerospace, governments, mass transit, electrical contractors, leisure and entertainment and telecommunications, among others.
Workplace Safety 
Within the Workplace Safety segment, the primary product categories include:

• | Safety and compliance signs, tags, and labels.


• | Informational signage.


• | Asset tracking labels.


• | First aid products.

The Workplace Safety segment manufactures a broad range of stock and custom identification products, and also sells a broad range of related resale products. Historically, both the Company and many of our competitors focused their businesses on catalog marketing, often with varying product niches. Many of our competitors extensively utilize e-commerce to promote the sale of their products. A consequence of e-commerce is price transparency, as prices on non-proprietary products can be easily compared. Therefore, to compete effectively, we continue to build out our e-commerce capabilities and focus on developing unique or customized solutions, enhancing customer experience, and providing compliance expertise as these are critical to retain existing customers and convert new customers. Workplace Safety primarily sells to businesses and serves many industries, including manufacturers, process industries, government, education, construction, and utilities.
Research and Development
The Company focuses its R&D efforts on pressure sensitive materials, printing systems, software, and the development of other workplace safety related products. Although there is an increasing amount of R&D that supports the WPS segment, the majority of R&D spend supports the IDS segment. Material development involves the application of surface chemistry concepts for top coatings and adhesives applied to a variety of base materials. Systems design integrates materials, embedded software and a variety of printing technologies to form a complete solution for customer applications. In addition, the R&D team supports production and marketing efforts by providing application and technical expertise.
The Company owns patents and tradenames relating to certain products in the United States and internationally. Although the Company believes patents are a significant driver in maintaining its position for certain products, technology in the areas covered by many of the patents continues to evolve and may limit the value of such patents. The Company's business is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for up to 20 years according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant, depending upon the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The Company's tradenames are valid ten years from the date of registration, and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis.
The Company spent $45.2 million, $45.3 million, and $39.6 million on its R&D activities during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The marginal decrease in R&D spending in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year was due to the timing of expenditures related to ongoing new product developments within the IDS and WPS segments. As of July 31, 2019, 249 individuals were engaged in R&D activities for the Company, which is essentially flat from 248 as of July 31, 2018.
Operations
The materials used in the products manufactured consist of a variety of plastic and synthetic films, paper, metal and metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, inks, dyes, adhesives, pigments, natural and synthetic rubber, organic chemicals, polymers, and solvents for consumable identification products in addition to electronic components, molded parts and sub-assemblies for printing systems. The Company operates coating facilities manufacturing bulk rolls of label stock for internal and external customers. In addition, the Company purchases finished products for resale.
The Company purchases raw materials, components and finished products from many suppliers. Overall, we are not dependent upon any single supplier for our most critical base materials or components; however, we have chosen in certain situations to sole source, or limit the sources of materials, components, or finished items for design or cost reasons. As a result, disruptions in supply could have an impact on results for a period of time, but we believe any disruptions would simply require qualification of new suppliers and the disruption would be modest. In certain instances, the qualification process could be more costly or take a longer period of time and in rare circumstances, such as a global shortage of critical materials or components, the financial impact could be material.
The Company carries working capital mainly related to accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Generally, custom products are made to order while an on-hand quantity of stock product is maintained to provide customers with timely delivery. Normal and customary payment terms range from net 10 to 90 days from date of invoice and vary by geography. 
The Company has a broad customer base, and no individual customer represents 10% or more of total net sales. 
Average time to fulfill customer orders varies from same-day to one month, depending on the type of product, customer request, and whether the product is stock or custom-designed and manufactured. The Company's backlog is not material, does not provide significant visibility for future business and is not pertinent to an understanding of the business.
