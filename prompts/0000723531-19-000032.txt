Item 1. Business
 Incorporated in Delaware in 1979, we are a leading provider of integrated human capital management (“HCM”) solutions for payroll, benefits, human resource (“HR”), and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses. As of May 31, 2019, we served approximately 670,000 payroll and PEO clients. We maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and serve clients throughout the U.S. and Europe. We report our results of operations and financial condition as one business segment. Our fiscal year ends May 31st.
 Company Strategy
 Our mission is to be the leading provider of HCM solutions for payroll, benefits, HR, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses by being an essential partner with America’s businesses.  We believe that success in this mission will lead to strong, long-term financial performance.  Our business strategy focuses on the following:
· | personalized, technology-enabled service;
--+------------------------------------------


· | industry-leading, integrated technology;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | providing a comprehensive suite of value-added HCM services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | solid sales execution;
--+-----------------------


· | continued service penetration; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | engaging in strategic acquisitions.
--+------------------------------------

  We do this through the Power of Simplicity.  Our industry-leading technology combines with our personalized, technology-enabled service to make payroll, benefits, and HR administration simple for our clients.  
 Our Clients
 The target market for our integrated HCM solutions is  the small- to mid-market space. Within this space, we serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the U.S. and Europe. Our clients have the option to select the HCM modules they need with the ability to easily add services as they grow. They can also opt for our comprehensive HR and payroll outsourcing solutions, which include our HR Solutions, an Administrative Services Organization (“ASO”) and our PEO services. This flexibility allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their needs. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), client retention was over 82% of our beginning client base for the fiscal year, in line with our historic best retention rate.
 We support our small-business clients, reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our dynamic products and customer service options for a quick and easy payday. Clients can choose to have our service team handle everything for them, or can process payroll themselves utilizing our robust Paychex Flex® processing platform or SurePayroll® online applications. Both products are cloud-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions that allow users to process payroll when they want, how they want, and on any device (desktop, tablet, and mobile phone).
 With an environment of increasing regulations, the need for HR outsourcing services is moving down-market.  Our small-business clients benefit from our time and attendance products, which allow them to accurately and efficiently manage the gathering and recording of employee hours worked.  Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, assist companies with the scheduling, tracking, and reporting of time. In addition, our small-market clients can choose one of our comprehensive HR and payroll outsourcing services, which include ASO and PEO services, and participate in our benefits offerings, which include our insurance and retirement services. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client’s needs. Our retirement services product line offers many plan design options to meet the client’s requirements, as well as investment options. 
 Our mid-market clients have more complex payroll and employee benefit needs. Our mid-market clients are serviced through our Paychex Flex Enterprise solution, which offers an integrated suite of HCM solutions on the Paychex Flex platform, or through our legacy platform.  Most new clients are sold on the Paychex Flex platform.  Clients using Paychex Flex Enterprise are offered a SaaS solution that integrates payroll processing with HR management, employee benefits administration, time and labor management, applicant tracking, and onboarding solutions.  Paychex Flex Enterprise allows mid-market clients to choose the services and software they need to meet the complexity of their business and all integrated into one HCM solution.

Description of Services
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and HR needs. Clients can select services on an á la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. Our offerings often leverage the information gathered in our base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum.
 Our portfolio of HCM and employee benefit-related services are comprised of the following: 
 Management Solutions:

· | Payroll processing services: Our payroll processing services include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Payroll tax administration services: Payroll tax administration services provide for accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable federal, state, and local tax or regulatory agencies. In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending up to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Employee payment services: Our employee payment services provide an employer the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex®), or a check drawn on the employer’s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Same day ACH functionality is also available for clients using direct deposit, allowing employers the flexibility to pay employees via direct deposit on the same day they initiate payroll. Our Readychex service provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Regulatory compliance services: We offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties. We also offer comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These services provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company’s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients have the ability to choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services clients include relationships with financial advisors.

· | Other HR services and products: We offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents.

· | Business services: We offer various business services to small- to medium-sized businesses. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Paychex Advance, LLC, provides a portfolio of services to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding (via the purchase of accounts receivable) and outsourcing services, which include payroll processing, invoicing, and tax preparation. Paychex Promise, a subscription-based service, offers protection against payroll interruptions and solutions to address routine challenges of running a successful business. The primary offering is payroll protection, which extends the collection of payroll funds from a client’s bank account by seven days without interruption of service or charges for insufficient funds. In addition, through partnerships with third-party providers, we provide clients opportunities for services such as payment processing services, financial fitness programs, and a small-business loan resource center.

(“HROi”), and Oasis offer businesses a combined package that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services. What differentiates our PEO services from our ASO services is that we serve as a co-employer of our clients’ employees, offer health care coverage to PEO client employees, and assume the risks and rewards of workers’ compensation insurance and certain benefit insurance offerings. We are certified under the Small Business Efficiency Act to provide PEO services.

Technology and Service Platform
 Paychex Flex is our proprietary HCM SaaS platform through which we provide an integrated product suite that covers the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement. Paychex Flex streamlines workforce management through innovative technology and flexible choice of service. It uses a single cloud-based platform, with single client and employee records and single sign-on, including self-service options and mobility applications. The HCM product suite integrates recruiting and applicant tracking, employee onboarding, payroll, employee benefits and HR administration, time and attendance, and retirement services. In addition, Paychex Flex presents function-focused analytics throughout the platform, assisting HR leaders with making more informed business decisions.  Paychex Flex also provides technology-enabled service, with options that include self-service, a 24/7 dedicated service center, an individual payroll specialist, and integrated service via a multi-product service center.  In addition, mid-market clients can utilize a relationship manager for more personalized service.  This flexible platform services our small- to medium-sized clients, and a portion of our PEO business. Our platform is backed by self-service capabilities that empower client employees to access their benefits and complete tasks from any location and on any device.  These self-service capabilities allow for greater convenience for client employees and greater productivity for our clients.
 We continue to invest in Paychex Flex, making significant enhancements designed to simplify the complexity of HR administration. The latest enhancements include HR Center with performance and learning management, workflow approvals, and enhanced real-time analytics; benefits management enhancements with a refreshed enrollment experience for health and benefits and retirement; and increased options through the use of chatbots and artificial intelligence.

Our Paychex mobile applications add greater value and convenience for our clients and their employees by allowing them instant access and increased productivity.  Paychex Flex uses a mobile-first design throughout our HCM suite, which allows full functionality of all application components, regardless of device or screen size.  Enabling our clients and their employees to have full access to our products offers diverse capabilities and flexibility for both the employer and employee.
 Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of services. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. We utilize a virtual sales force to service geographical areas where we may not have a local presence, cover inbound leads for certain small-business clients, and for products for which we do not have a local sales force.
 In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client referrals. Approximately 50% of our new small-market payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national associations, and franchise channels.  We also utilize digital marketing as a means to market our services.
 We have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business SolutionsTM Program. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2021.  We also partner with numerous state CPA society organizations.
 Our website is available at www.paychex.com.  It is a cost-efficient channel that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct and virtual sales forces. This online channel allows us to market to existing and prospective clients that want to learn more about our products and services. The website offers information about our core lines of business: payroll (www.paychex.com/payroll), human resources (www.paychex.com/human-resources), benefits (www.paychex.com/employee-benefits), and insurance (www.paychex.com/business-insurance).
 Paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory change as well as HR and business best practices. Paychex WORX website, available at www.paychex.com/worx, is a digital destination for insightful resources useful for businesses at every stage, from entrepreneur to enterprise. Paychex WORX highlights our expertise, and ability to help businesses of all sizes with a wide range of HR and financial information for current clients and prospects alike.

We also track current regulatory issues that impact the business community and provide regulatory updates. We issue small business trend reports through our Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch. Our Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals. Through the Paychex Flex online platform, AccountantHQ offers access to authorized client payroll and HR data and key account contacts, along with an extensive accountant resource library. AccountantHQ drives efficiency by putting accountants in the best position possible to easily access critical client payroll and HR data, as well as powerful reporting tools. 
 Markets and Competition
 We remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Our internal database source indicates that there are over 10 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve.
 The market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, international, regional, local, and online service providers. In addition to traditional payroll processing and HR service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and HR systems and departments. Payroll and HR systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our products also compete with a variety of providers of HR services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, HR and benefits consulting firms, and national and regional PEOs.
 Competition in the payroll processing and HR services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas.  We believe that our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, combined with personalized service provided by industry professionals, distinguishes us from our competitors.
 Software Maintenance and Development
 The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and HR services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and maintaining our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience.  Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success. Employees
 We believe our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business is important to our future success and growth. As of May 31, 2019, we employed approximately 15,600 people, of which approximately 15,300 people were employed on a full-time basis.  None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Intellectual Property
 We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us. Seasonality
 There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new worksite employees associated with our HR Solutions ASO and PEO businesses tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses, clients requesting additional year-end services, and the preparation and delivery of end-of year reporting requirements.
