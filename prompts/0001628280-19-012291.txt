Operating Segments
During the twelve months ended July 31, 2019, the Company changed the determination of reportable segments. This change was made to be consistent with the information provided to the Company's chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") 
2

for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance and quantitative thresholds. The Company has determined that it has two reportable segments: Supply Chain and Direct Marketing. The July 31, 2018 financial information has been restated to reflect these changes on a comparable basis. The Company also has Corporate-level activity, which consists primarily of costs associated with certain corporate administrative functions such as legal, finance, share-based compensation and acquisition costs which are not allocated to the Company's reportable segments. The Corporate-level balance sheet information includes cash and cash equivalents, notes payables and other assets and liabilities which are not identifiable to the operations of the Company's operating segments. Certain reportable segment information, including revenue, profit and asset information, is set forth in Note 18 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in Item 7 below.
Technology Infrastructure
ModusLink's information technology systems and infrastructure serve as the backbone of a client's fully integrated global supply chain services and manages the flow and use of physical assets and information. ModusLink offers a secure and redundant operating environment to ensure the integrity and privacy of its clients' data. ModusLink works with clients to integrate data, tools and applications to deliver an optimized solution that meets its clients' business needs and improves management of the global supply chain. ModusLink's Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system is designed to provide the visibility and control needed for better decision making, rapid response to global market dynamics and effective asset utilization across services and geographies. 
IWCO has dual redundant data centers located in our Minnesota and Pennsylvania locations. These data centers have been architected to provide full resiliency and security to enable our optimal and always on computing resources to support IWCO's enterprise business applications and complex data processing required by our customers. IWCO's information security practice is a leader in the industry and is audited and certified annually against ISO-27001, HiTrust, PCI and HIPAA controls and standards. IWCO has fully integrated and enterprise class business systems including an industry specific ERP that has been customized to support IWCO's unique business flows. These business systems provide end-to-end tracking and visibility to both front end business support functions as well as to our entire manufacturing operation.
Competition
The market for the supply chain management service offerings provided by ModusLink is highly competitive. As a provider with service offerings covering a range of supply chain operations and activities across the globe, ModusLink competes with different companies depending on the type of service it is providing or the geographic area in which an activity is taking place. ModusLink faces competition from Electronics Manufacturing Services/Contract Manufacturers (EMS/CM), third party logistics (3PL) providers, Supply Chain Management (SCM) companies, and regional specialty companies. For certain digital commerce services, ModusLink's competition includes global outsource providers, software as service (SaaS) providers, technology providers and computer software providers offering content and document management solutions. As a provider of an outsourcing solution, ModusLink's competition also includes current and prospective clients, who evaluate ModusLink's capabilities in light of their own capabilities and cost structures.
The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are quality and range of solutions and services, technological capabilities, costs, location of facilities, responsiveness, and adaptability. With ModusLink's set of supply chain services, global footprint, strong client service acumen, and its integrated global supply chain digital commerce services, the Company believes that it is well positioned to compete in each of the markets it serves, while expanding across various industry subsets.
The market for the range of services offered by IWCO Direct is highly competitive and fragmented. IWCO Direct's scope and scale of end-to-end services provides a competitive advantage by being able to focus on efficiency while making the end product more effective in driving response for clients. While the ability to offer a more effective marketing product is highly valued, we must continue to provide it at a competitive price and aggressively manage our cost structure to maintain our client roster and attract new business.
Competitors for our print/mail products and services include printers, envelope manufacturers, and commercial lettershops (i.e. mail service providers). Competitors for our Marketing Services practice include internal and external agencies and data and analytics companies.
Clients
3

A limited number of clients account for a significant percentage of the Company's consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 49% and 44% of consolidated net revenue, respectively. One client, associated with the Supply Chain segment, accounted for 11% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. No other clients accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. No clients accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. In general, the Company does not have any agreements which obligate any client to buy a minimum amount of services from the Company, or which designate the Company as its sole supplier of any particular services. The loss of a significant amount of business or program with any key client could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that it will continue to derive the vast majority of its consolidated operating revenue from sales to a small number of clients. There can be no assurance that revenue from key clients will not decline in future periods.
The Company sells its services to its clients primarily on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to contracts with minimum purchase requirements. Consequently, sales are subject to demand variability by such clients. The Company purchases and maintains adequate levels of inventory in order to meet client needs rapidly and on a timely basis. The Company has no guaranteed price, quantity or delivery agreements with its suppliers other than the purchase obligations noted in Note 8 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 below. Because of the diversity of its services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of its facilities, the Company uses numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for its operations. The Company is not and does not expect to be adversely affected by an inability to obtain materials.
IWCO's services include (a) development of direct mail and omnichannel marketing strategies (b) creative services to design direct mail, email, and online marketing (c) printing and compiling of direct mail pieces into envelopes ready for mailing (d) commingling services to sort mail produced for various customers, by destination to achieve optimized postal savings (e) and business continuity and disaster recovery services for critical communications to protect against unexpected business interruptions. The major markets served by IWCO Direct include financial services, Multiple-System Operations ("MSO") (cable or direct-broadcast satellite TV systems), insurance and to a lesser extent subscription/services, healthcare, travel/hospitality and other. Direct mail is a critical piece of marketing for most of its current customers who use direct mail to acquire new customers. Management believes that direct mail will remain an important part of its customer's budgets for the foreseeable future, based on its proven ability to enhance results when used as part of an omnichannel marketing strategy.
International Operations
Supply Chain currently conducts business in many countries including China, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Singapore, among others, in addition to its North America operations. IWCO does not currently have international operations. During the year ended July 31, 2019, revenues from our foreign operations accounted for approximately 32.5% of total revenues.
The Company's international operations increase its exposure to U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and labor practices, which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes, and with which the Company must comply. A substantial portion of our international business is conducted in China, where we face (i) the challenge of navigating a complex set of licensing and tax requirements and restrictions affecting the conduct of business in China by foreign companies, (ii) potential limitations on the repatriation of cash, (iii) foreign currency fluctuation and (iv) evolving tax laws.
Seasonality
The demand of our Supply Chain clients' products is subject to seasonal consumer buying patterns. As a result, the services we provide to our clients are also subject to seasonality, with higher revenue and operating income typically being realized from handling our clients' products during the first half of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday selling season. IWCO Direct's business is not typically subject to seasonal buying patterns.
Intellectual Property
The Company relies upon a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. From time to time, we develop new trade secrets and other intellectual property or obtain intellectual property through acquisition activities. Our business is not substantially dependent on any single or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
