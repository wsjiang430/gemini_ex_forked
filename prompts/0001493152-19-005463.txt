ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Imaging3, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCQB: IGNG) is a development stage medical device company. The Company has developed a portable, proprietary, X-ray imaging technology designed to produce 3D images in real time. The Company’s devices are designed to operate flexibly to serve varying imaging applications with less radiation exposure in a lower cost, lower weight and easily transportable format that does not require specialized power sources when compared to currently available 3D imaging devices. The Company’s lead device, the Dominion Smartscan, for which the Company plans to submit a 510K application with the FDA in 2020, will be easily transportable and will operate on conventional 110V power sources. While the Company’s primary focus is on applications for the healthcare industry (human and veterinary), there are many potential non-healthcare related applications for the Company’s technology, including agricultural and industrial parts inspection and security screening.
 
Importantly and discussed in greater detail in the Recent Development and Subsequent Events sections, the Company began discussions with Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc. (GBI) of Westwood, CA, on March 1, 2019, regarding the possible reverse acquisition of Company by GBI.
 
BUSINESS 
 
Overview 
 
Imaging3 Inc. is a medical device company that has developed a patented fluoroscopic imaging device, the Dominion Smartscan™ (“Dominion”) that can produce real-time 2D, 3D and CT-like slice-through images in one second of imaging time and without the radiation associated with other much more costly and time-consuming technologies. In 2018, the Company was focused on securing the financing necessary for efforts towards gaining FDA marketing authorization via the 510K process, further developing the final product, expanding of the existing patent estate, and building the management team necessary to execute these steps towards successful commercialization. Currently, efforts are focused exclusively on the US market. The Dominion system is not currently available for sale in any market.
 
Near-term, the Dominion is an easily transportable imaging system which allows for basic 2D X-rays (e.g., imaging of bone and soft tissue) and can do so in one second or less of imaging time using radiation levels at or below equivalent X-ray imaging devices. Unlike other current technologies, from one second of imaging time the Dominion can also produce precise 3D models and 3D CT-like slice through imaging, which we believe will offer healthcare providers unusually valuable information about their patient, in settings where this is not normally available with current technologies. In the future, the use of the Dominion to provide real-time “live” (continuous) 3D imaging offers the potential to use the device to guide minimally invasive surgery (MIS).
 
The Company believes that the Dominion has potential uses where a flexible X-ray/CT-like image is desired without the need for a special room, where real-time “live” imaging would be beneficial, and in populations where traditional higher radiation dosing modalities must be avoided. Examples of these applications could be in clinics or communities that cannot justify the multi-million dollar expense of a CT device, in clinics or environments such as pediatrics where a one-second 2D or 3D image of an injury would be beneficial, in transport-dependent military combat and disaster management applications, in developing countries, and ultimately, where minimally invasive surgery is practiced.
 
The Dominion system utilizes an O-ring design, where the X-ray image capture technology circles the target area. During 180 degrees of travel, the system typically takes 180 images. The data from these images are processed through a proprietary algorithm and software to produce a 3D model of the volume that was imaged, which can then be sliced and analyzed from any angle to provide images and information that maximize value to the healthcare provider and patient. This process is completed fast enough that the 3D image can be delivered effectively in real-time.

Historical
 
In June 2010, the Company submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the Dominion system. In March 2012, the FDA notified the Company that the Dominion Smartscan system did not meet the required criteria for substantial equivalence based upon the live surgical guidance performance claims requested and the data and information submitted by the Company in the 510(k) submission. The founder and CEO of the Company was convicted of fraudulent misrepresentations and was completely eliminated from the management and direction of the Company, and the Company subsequently declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and was delisted by the SEC. Following these interactions with the FDA and an extended period of rebuilding the Company for a re-start, the Company determined that a new 510(k) application would need to be submitted with more modest initial claims in 2D and 3D fluoroscopy in order to facilitate an early FDA clearance for the Dominion Smartscan system. The Company has engaged expert regulatory consultants to facilitate an FDA clearance for the Dominion Smartscan system, to be followed by initial commercialization in the USA.
 
Pursuant to the above, in recent years the Company has reduced its workforce, abandoned certain equipment designs, canceled certain contracts, written down inventory, written off certain patents, completed financial restructuring and successfully emerged from bankruptcy, as well as completed a multi-year SEC remediation and release process. The Company believes that it is now repositioned with new leadership and a clear opportunity to achieve its goals for the development and commercialization of the Dominion SmartScan system.
 
We believe that future outcomes of minimally invasive surgeries will be enhanced through the combination of the Dominion’s more advanced tools and imaging functionality, which are designed to: (i) empower the surgical team with improved precision, surgical guidance options and visualization; (ii) improve patient satisfaction and post-operative recovery; and (iii) provide a cost-effective imaging system, compared to existing alternatives, for a wide range of clinical applications that are currently un-served or underserved with medical imaging solutions.
 
Our business strategy is to focus on the development and commercialization of the Dominion Smartscan system, through tiered levels of performance claims, regulatory approvals, and commercialization in an expanding portfolio of application areas.
 
Market Overview 
 
Over the past two decades, fluoroscopic imaging (C-arm devices) has emerged as a lower radiation dosing and more operationally convenient alternative to CT scans in minimally invasive surgery applications. In C-arm imaging, two views are necessary to provide orthogonal diagnostic view perspectives. The process of repositioning the C-arm to generate the two images and their subsequent translation into a 3D image and/or slice analysis, typically requires seconds or minutes of elapsed time. This makes it impossible to create a “live” real-time 3D image and slice analysis. Additionally, working from just two orthogonal images requires significant extrapolation and consequent imprecision or error in 3D image reconstruction.
 
Beyond the particularly high-value surgical guidance applications, billions of 2D and 3D imaging procedures across a broad range of clinical applications are now performed each year worldwide. The majority of these imaging procedures continue to be traditional 2D X-rays, although the value of these procedures is now dwarfed by the value delivered and captured in 3D imaging and slice analysis, and in live 3D guidance procedures.
 
While C-arm surgical guidance imaging has decreased the invasiveness of many previously open surgical procedures, it still has many limitations. These traditional imaging techniques still require multiple x-rays and extended time delays to achieve the visualization and triangulation required to provide successful surgical guidance results. Many such traditional imaging instruments are relatively rigid instruments that lack the external articulation required to provide the equipment dexterity needed for complex imaging tasks. Most x-ray imaging is performed with two-dimensional (“2D”) visualization of the subject or operative field, making the often-important dimension of depth perception difficult.

A persistent challenge associated with x-ray imaging is the utilization of tissue-damaging ionizing radiation. The introduction of lower radiation dosing solutions that achieve equivalent outcomes versus current higher radiation dosing modalities will always be a compelling additional value proposition in the comparison of imaging technologies.
 
Despite its limitations, traditional fluoroscopy remains the prevalent technique in minimally invasive surgery. We believe that the Dominion device, with its CT-like imaging with lower radiation dosing capabilities, will provide higher value to facilitate adoption by radiologists and will enhance surgical outcomes over use of traditional imaging methods.
 
Modern imaging technologies, including computer-controlled automated slice analyses, have developed as technologies that offer the potential to improve upon many aspects of the traditional 2D or C-arm 3D x-ray imaging experience. Hundreds of thousands of CT radiological procedures are now performed each year worldwide, but they remain a small fraction of the total imaging procedures performed. While initial widespread adoption of imaging was focused on 2D x-ray images, and CT scanning procedures were primarily performed in high-cost, custom-built rooms, CT scanning has been more recently applied to many other clinical applications, particularly in general surgery. Despite recent advances, we believe there remain many limitations associated with current fluoroscopic and CT imaging systems used in connection with minimally invasive surgeries.
 
Product Overview 
 
With the introduction of the Dominion, the Company intends to provide a unique tool to provide access in many non-traditional settings to better visualization of a wide variety of healthcare related issues and to facilitate better-informed decision-making, ranging from basic 2D X-rays to 3D imaging and slice analyses, and ultimately, to guidance of minimally invasive surgical procedures. In addition to human medical applications, the Dominion is expected to deliver unique new value in many non-traditional settings for inspection of foods, industrial parts, and in security screenings.
Current Product Offering 
 
Dominion Smartscan system 
 
The Dominion Smartscan system is a multi-functional imaging system that allows up to 360 images to be obtained from a single 360-degree orbit of its O-ring design. The Dominion utilizes a fluoroscopic cone beam X-ray emitter such as those used in some modern fluoroscopic C-arm systems, but unlike the two images that are typically utilized from the use of the C-arm, the 3D images generated from the Dominion system are constructed in real time from approximately 180 images. The Company believes that the additional data provided allows for more complete, accurate and precise 3D image reconstruction, and does not rely as heavily on the extrapolated volume-filling of current software solutions based upon two orthogonal images. The Company also believes that the Dominion will deliver its benefits at a significant cost savings to the healthcare system.
 
Key features of the Dominion Smartscan system are:
 

● | Real-time imaging: The Dominion Smartscan can provide real-time 3D images, including the ability to provide live continuous real-time 3D imaging in a surgical setting. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low radiation: The system’s fluoroscopic X-ray emitters produce 2D and 3D images, including CT-like slice analyses, from just one second of imaging time with X-ray power levels flexibly reduced to minimum requirements for each application. 
● | Multi-functional: The Dominion Smartscan is expected to weigh under 150 pounds and to utilize standard 110/120v power sources. The Dominion unit is envisioned to be mountable within or upon a vehicle or easily wheeled around an office, clinic or hospital.

-


● | Cost savings: The Dominion system offers an extremely broad variety of potential applications, without the need for a multi-million dollar investment in a CT device and custom room installation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Improved Throughput for Doctors: Having a low cost, small footprint, easily mobile imaging solution with the ability to produce CT like images in real time, along with traditional static 2D and 3D images and slice analyses, will help doctors realize greater throughput of patients, faster turnaround of patient results, and improved outcomes and higher patient satisfaction. 

Business Strategy 
 
Our current strategy is to focus our resources on FDA clearance and commercialization of the Dominion Smartscan system, initially for performance claims focusing on 2D and 3D fluoroscopy. Following market introduction of the Dominion and establishment of appropriate clinical collaborations, an expanding portfolio of application claims will be pursued for higher value applications. After interactions with the FDA, we have prioritized our short-term operational strategy around the finalization and prosecution of an initial 510(k) application for The Dominion Smartscan system, with the assistance of an expert regulatory consultancy team.
 
We believe that:
 

● | There are a vast number of urgent/emergency care, sports and other clinical specialty settings, hospitals, combat and emergency response and other settings in the U.S. and globally where trained medical staff could benefit from and would adopt an easily transportable, 110V powered, low acquisition and operating cost, rapid 3D imaging and slice analysis system such as the Dominion Smartscan system; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Physicians, healthcare systems and patients will continue to seek reduced ionizing radiation alternatives for many common imaging needs, and the Dominion system’s flexibility for minimization of radiation dosing to the functional minimums required for each imaging task will be an attractive feature; 
● | These same features will prove to be similarly attractive in expanding markets for agricultural and industrial parts inspection, and security screening. 

Marketing 
 
Imaging3 competes in the medical diagnostic imaging market, and this market continues to grow vigorously in installed equipment base and numbers of procedures performed. This vitality is due primarily to continual technological improvements that lead to faster and higher-resolution imaging, greater patient safety, and the provision of these capabilities to a geographically disperse and rapidly growing global population. This has resulted in vigorous competition to create the most cost-effective diagnostic imaging systems, still preponderantly focused on high resolution imaging.
 
According to a Freedonia Group study, the medical imaging equipment market in the US is greater than $9.5 billion and has a projected growth rate greater than that for overall national healthcare expenditures. Growth will be stimulated by ever increasing utilization in patient procedures involving diagnostic imaging, driven by factors including demographics of an aging population, advances in noninvasive surgical procedures, expanding demonstrations of improved medical outcomes from utilization of medical imaging, and decreasing cost of medical imaging due to competitive intensity.

Intellectual Property 
 
We believe that our intellectual property and expertise is an important competitive resource. We intend to maintain an active program of intellectual property protection, both to assure that the proprietary technology developed by the Company is appropriately protected and, where necessary, to assure that there is no infringement of our proprietary technology by competitors.
 
The following summarizes our current patent and patent application portfolio.
 
Patents and Patent Applications Owned by the Company: The Company holds one United States patent, and it has more than 21 patent amendments filed in the United States. In each instance, we own all right, title and interest, and no licenses, security interests or other encumbrances have been granted on such patents and patent applications.
 
Our issued patent resulted from filings related to the Dominion Smartscan system. The patent will remain in force until 2024 and we intend to seek further patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and internationally, where available and when appropriate, as we continue our product development efforts.
 
Competition 
 
Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations with traditional target customers, as well as worldwide distribution channels that are well developed and established.
 
There are many competitive offerings in the field of radiology imaging. Several companies have launched devices that enable reduced radiation without real-time 3D imaging. Our imaging competitors include, but are not limited to: Fujifilm, GE, Siemens, Medtronic, Samsung, Shimadzu, Carestream, Hitachi, Hologic, Esaote, Toshiba, Striker, Phillips, Ziehm, and OEC. In addition, non-ionizing radiation imaging modalities including but not limited to ultrasound imaging continue to make important advances.
 
In addition to imaging device manufacturer competitors, there are many products and therapies that are designed to reduce the need for or attractiveness of imaging intervention. These products and therapies may impact the overall volume of imaging procedures and negatively impact our business.
 
Our ability to compete may be affected by the failure to fully educate physicians in the use of our products and products in development, or by the level of physician expertise. This may have the effect of making our products less attractive. Some medical device companies are actively engaged in research and development of imaging systems or other medical devices and tools used in minimally invasive surgery procedures. We cannot predict the basis upon which we will compete with new products marketed by others.
 
Government Regulation of our Product Development Activities 
 
The U.S. government and foreign governments regulate the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to, the U.S. FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries, including the European Union. Any device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country.
Device Development, Marketing Clearance and Approval 
 
Medical devices are subject to varying levels of pre-market regulatory requirements. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: (i) Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls; (ii) Class II devices are somewhat more complex and receive greater scrutiny from the FDA and have heightened regulatory clearance requirements; and (iii) Class III devices are new, high risk devices, and frequently are permanently implantable or help sustain life and generally require a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) by the FDA.

In the United States, a company typically can obtain permission to distribute a new medical device in one of two ways. The first applies to any device that is substantially equivalent to a device first marketed prior to May 1976, or to another device marketed after that date, but which was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device. These devices are either Class I or Class II devices. To obtain FDA clearance to distribute the medical device, a company generally must submit a Section 510(k) notification, and receive an FDA order finding substantial equivalence to a predicate device (pre-May 1976 device or post-May 1976 device that was substantially equivalent to a pre-May 1976 device) and permitting commercial distribution of that medical device for its intended use. A 510(k) notification must provide information supporting a claim of substantial equivalence to a single medical device, the predicate device. If clinical data from human experience are required to support the 510(k) notification, these data must be gathered in compliance with investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations for investigations performed in the United States. The 510(k) process is normally used for products of the type that the Company is developing and proposes to market and sell. The FDA review process for premarket notifications submitted pursuant to Section 510(k) takes 90 days, pursuant to statutory requirements, but it can take substantially longer if the FDA has questions regarding the regulatory submission. It is possible for Section 510(k) clearance procedures to take from six to twenty-four months, depending on the concerns raised by the FDA and the complexity of the device. There is no guarantee that the FDA will “clear” a medical device for marketing, in which case the device cannot be distributed in the United States. There is also no guarantee that the FDA will deem the applicable device subject to the 510(k) process, as opposed to the more time-consuming, resource-intensive and challenging PMA process described below. In 2011, the FDA issued a series of draft guidance documents designed to reform the 510(k) clearance process. Similarly, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 authorized the FDA to collect user fees for the review of certain pre-market submissions received on or after October 1, 2012, including 510(k) notifications.
 
The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a pre-1976 product or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices. For example, most implantable devices are subject to the approval process as a Class III device. Two steps of FDA approval are generally required before a company can market a product in the United States that is subject to pre-market approval, as a Class III device. First, a company must comply with IDE regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device. These regulations permit a company to undertake a clinical study of a “non-significant risk” device without formal FDA approval. Prior express FDA approval is required if the device is a significant risk device. Second, the FDA must approve the company’s PMA application, which contains, among other things, clinical information acquired under the IDE. Additionally, devices subject to PMA approval may be subject to a panel review to obtain marketing approval and are required to pass a factory inspection in accordance with the current “good manufacturing practices” standards in order to obtain approval. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, approximately one to two years or more. However, in some instances the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high-risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances, FDA may allow a device to be down classified from Class III to Class I or II.
 
The de novo classification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low to moderate risk that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a “not substantially equivalent” (“NSE”) determination in response to a 510(k) notification. The regulations have also been amended to allow a sponsor to submit a de novo classification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. These types of applications are referred to as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation” or “de novo.” In instances where a device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a Class II predicate device, the candidate device may be filed as a de novo application which may lead to delays in regulatory decisions by the FDA. FDA review of a de novo application may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device and worthy of either an exempt or 510(k) regulatory pathway.

We believe that the Dominion Smartscan system should be approvable as a Class II device for 2D and 3D imaging and slice analysis applications, and we are in the process of pursuing such a Section 510(k) clearance for the Dominion Smartscan system. Later FDA submissions are expected to address expanded claims for live real-time 3D surgical guidance imaging applications, and these will seek to utilize a Class II device 510(k) clearance with suitable comparison to predicate devices. The FDA might find that a 510(k) submission does not provide the evidence required to prove that the Dominion Smartscan system is substantially equivalent to marketed Class II devices. If that were to occur, we could be required to undertake the more complex and costly PMA process or perhaps be considered for a de novo reclassification. For either the 510(k), de novo, or the PMA process, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials, which would take more time, cost more money and pose other risks and uncertainties.
 
Clinical studies conducted in the U.S. or used in any U.S. application on an unapproved medical device require approval from the FDA prior to initiation. Even when a clinical study has been approved by the FDA or deemed approved, the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to, the fact that the institutional review board (IRB) at a specified clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval, or might suspend or terminate the study before its completion. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated. In addition, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure the FDA that the product is safe and effective, a prerequisite for FDA approval of a PMA, or substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate device, a prerequisite for clearance under Section 510(k). Even if the FDA approves or clears a device, it may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distribution of the device may not be commercially feasible.
 
After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain serious adverse events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval of the device, or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or require additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
 
A manufacturer of a device approved through the PMA process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affect its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its PMA and obtaining FDA approval for that supplement, prior to marketing the modified device. In some instances, the FDA may require clinical trials to support a supplement application. A manufacturer of a device cleared through the 510(k) process must submit an additional premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source, labeling or manufacturing process. Any change in the intended uses of a PMA device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or new cleared premarket notification. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
 
Continuing FDA Regulation 
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | establishment of registration and device listing with the FDA; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | quality system regulations, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; 
● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, i.e. “off label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 


9
-


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA on field corrections and product recalls or removals, if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | requirements to conduct post-marketing surveillance studies to establish continued safety data. 

 
We are required to and have registered with the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) as medical device manufacturers, and must obtain all necessary permits and licenses to operate our business. As manufacturers, we and our suppliers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and other regulations.
 
In Europe, we need to comply with the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD”) and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. To achieve compliance, our products must meet the “Essential Requirements” of the MDD relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo verification of our regulatory compliance, or conformity assessment, by a notified body selected by us. The level of scrutiny of such assessment depends on the regulatory class of the product. We are subject to continued surveillance by our notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell products. These regulations require us or our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing, labeling and control activities.
 
Impact of Regulation 
 
Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, among other things, any of the following sanctions:

● | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | repair, replacement, refund or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modifications to existing products; 
● | withdrawing or suspending clearances or approvals that are already granted; 
● | criminal prosecution; and 
● | disgorgement of profits. 

 
Further, the levels of revenues and profitability of medical device companies like the Company may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls.
 
Therefore, we cannot assure you that any of our products will be considered cost effective, or that, following any commercialization of our products, coverage and reimbursement will be available or sufficient to allow us to manufacture and sell them competitively and profitably.

Health Care Regulation 
 
Our business activities are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician payment transparency laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 
In the United States, there have been, and we expect there to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives, at both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that, if approved, could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. At the current time, our products are not defined as durable medical equipment (“DME”). Non-DME devices used in imaging systems procedures are normally paid directly by the hospital or health care provider and not reimbursed separately by third-party payers. Instead, the hospital or health care provider is reimbursed based on the procedure performed and the inpatient or outpatient stay. As a result, these types of devices are subject to intense price competition that can place a small manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage as hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and health care providers attempt to negotiate lower prices for products such as the ones we develop and sell.
 
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the reconciliation law known as Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Reconciliation Act,”) and together (the “2010 Health Care Reform Legislation”). The constitutionality of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation was confirmed twice by the Supreme Court of the United States. Both Congressional leaders and President Trump have announced plans to repeal or modify the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. At this time the Company is not certain as to the impact of federal health care legislation on its business.
 
The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation subjects manufacturers of medical devices to an excise tax of 2.3% on certain U.S. sales of medical devices beginning in January 2013. This excise tax was suspended in December 2015 for two years, and we anticipate that this may be repealed. If eventually implemented, this excise tax will likely increase our expenses in the future.
 
Further, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation includes the Open Payments Act (formerly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), which, in conjunction with its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of certain drugs, biologics, and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. We have provided reports under the Open Payments Act to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services since 2014. The failure to report appropriate data accurately, timely, and completely could subject us to significant financial penalties. Other countries and several states currently have similar laws and more may enact similar legislation.
 
International Regulation and Potential Impact 
 
Through marketing and acquisition of Dominion Smartscan systems, the Company intends to expand into international markets. Some of these markets maintain unique regulatory requirements outside of or in addition to those of the U.S. FDA and the European Union. The Dominion Smartscan system is not CE marked, which would allow us to offer the product for sale in a number of jurisdictions, including select countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Due to the variations in regulatory requirements within territories, the Company may be required to perform additional safety or clinical testing or fulfill additional agency requirements for specific territories. The Company may also be required to apply for registration using third parties within those territories and may be dependent upon the third parties’ successful regulatory processes to file, register and list the product applications and associated labeling, which could lead to significant investments and resource use. These additional requirements may result in delays in international registrations and commercialization of our products in certain countries.

Recent Developments
 
On March 11, 2019 the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) to be acquired in a reverse acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Grapefruit Boulevard Investments, Inc., a privately held Los Angeles area cannabis company (the “Acquirer”). The Acquirer holds licenses issued by the State of California to manufacture and distribute cannabis products in California. The Acquirer commenced operations in mid-2018 and has received more than $550,000.00 in revenue from operations since they commenced. The Acquirer maintains facilities near Palm Springs in Riverside County, California. On Thursday, March 7, 2019 the Acquirer obtained its final permit and clearance from the local fire department to commence operation of an ethanol extraction laboratory at such facilities and will initiate related extraction and post processing operations as soon as practicable. The Acquirer’s laboratory will be able to extract CBD hemp under Federal law pursuant to the recently signed 2018 Farm Act that classifies CBD hemp as an insurable commodity.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company and the Acquirer have initiated negotiations intended to result in completion of a definitive Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) encompassing all of the material terms of the Agreement during the second quarter of 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Agreement will provide that upon conclusion of the Acquisition, the Acquirer’s designees shall own 80% of the then outstanding common shares of the Company and the Company’s current shareholders shall own 20% of such outstanding common shares. In addition, the Company will be required to settle certain outstanding creditor obligations on terms acceptable to both the Acquirer and the Company.
 
Furthermore, the Acquirer is required to obtain a commitment for a bridge loan of not less than $1,250,000.00 to be funded upon the closing of the Acquisition and an equity infusion of at least $5,000,000.00 at a pre-money valuation of at least $15,000,000.00 to be funded upon the closing of the Acquisition.
 
Simultaneous with a successful closing of the Acquisition, the Company will assign all rights to its intellectual property and assets relating to its Dominion imaging technology to a private closely held Company (the “Dominion Enterprise”) to be owned by IGNG, current IGNG management and board members, certain other persons currently associated with the Company and the Acquirer’s designees in percentages to be negotiated among those persons prior to the closing of the transaction. The Dominion Enterprise will thereafter execute its business plan as previously articulated in IGNG’s periodic reports to the SEC.
 
At the closing, current IGNG officers and directors shall appoint the Acquirer’s designees to officers’ and directors’ positions at post acquisition IGNG and resign their officer and director positions.
