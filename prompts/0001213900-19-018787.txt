ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Relmada is a clinical-stage, publicly traded biotechnology company focused on the development of d-methadone (dextromethadone, REL-1017), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. d-methadone is a new chemical entity that potentially addresses areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and other disorders.
 
Our lead product candidate, d-methadone, is a New Chemical Entity (NCE) being developed as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression and other potential indications. We have completed Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies. A Phase 2 study in major depressive disorder is ongoing, with first patient dosed in June 2018 and last patient-last dose completed in July 2019. We expect to have top line results in the second half of 2019.
 
NMDA receptors are present in many parts of the central nervous system and play important roles in regulating neuronal activity. We believe that dextromethadone acting as a NMDA receptor antagonist can have potential applications in a number of disease indications which mitigates risk and offers significant upside.
 
In addition, the Company has a portfolio of three 505b2 product candidates at various stages of development. These products are: LevoCap ER (REL-1015), an abuse resistant, sustained release dosage form of the opioid analgesic levorphanol; BuTab (oral buprenorphine, REL-1028), an oral dosage form of the opioid analgesic buprenorphine; and MepiGel (topical mepivacaine, REL-1021), an orphan drug designated topical formulation of the local anesthetic mepivacaine.
 
Our four development projects are briefly described below:
 
d-Methadone (dextromethadone, REL-1017) and Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)
 
Background
 
In 2014, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimated that 15.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. According to data from nationally representative surveys supported by NIMH, only about half of Americans diagnosed with major depression in a given year receive treatment. Of those receiving treatment with as many as four different standard antidepressants, 33% of drug-treated depression patients do not achieve adequate therapeutic benefits according to the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Accordingly, we believe that approximately 3 million patients with such treatment-resistant depression are in need of new treatment options.

In addition to the high failure rate, none of the marketed products for depression can demonstrate rapid antidepressant effects and most of the products take up to a month to show effectiveness. The urgent need for improved, faster acting antidepressant treatments is underscored by the fact that severe depression can be life-threatening, due to heightened risk of suicide.
 
Recent studies have shown that ketamine, a drug known previously as an anesthetic, can lift depression in many patients within hours. Like d-methadone, ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist. However, it is unlikely that ketamine itself will become a practical treatment for most cases of depression. It must be administered through intravenous infusion or intranasally, requiring a hospital setting, and more importantly can potentially trigger adverse side effects including psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations, memory defects, panic attacks), nausea/vomiting, somnolence, cardiovascular stimulation and, in a minority of patients, hepatoxicity. Ketamine also hasn’t been thoroughly studied for long-term safety and effectiveness, and the FDA hasn’t approved it to treat depression.
 
d-Methadone Overview and Mechanism of Action
 
d-Methadone’s mechanism of action, as a non-competitive NMDA channel blocker or antagonist, is fundamentally differentiated from all currently FDA-approved antidepressants, as well as all atypical antipsychotics used adjunctively with standard, FDA-approved antidepressants. Working through the same brain mechanisms as ketamine but potentially lacking its adverse side effects, Relmada’s d-methadone is being developed as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression and/or other potential CNS pathological conditions.
 
In chemistry an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one’s left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis. A racemic compound, or racemate, is one that has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule. For racemic drugs, often only one of a drug’s enantiomers is responsible for the desired physiologic effects, while the other enantiomer is less active or inactive.
 
Racemic methadone has been used since the 1950s as a treatment for opioid addiction and has remained the primary therapy for this condition for more than 40 years. Methadone is a highly lipophilic molecule that is suitable for a variety of administration routes, with oral bioavailability close to 80%.
 
As a single isomer of racemic methadone, d-methadone has been shown to possess NMDA antagonist properties with virtually no traditional opioid or ketamine-like adverse events at the expected therapeutic doses. In contrast, racemic methadone is associated with common opioid side effects that include anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, sleep problems (insomnia), nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, drowsiness, and others. It has been shown that the left (levo) isomer, l-methadone, is largely responsible for methadone’s opioid activity, while the right (dextro) isomer, d-methadone, is much less active as an opioid while maintaining affinity for the NMDA receptor.
 
NMDA receptors are present in many parts of the central nervous system and play important roles in regulating neuronal activity and promoting synaptic plasticity in brain areas important for cognitive functions such as executive function, learning and memory. Based on these premises, d-methadone could show benefits in several different CNS indications.
 
d-Methadone Phase 1 Clinical Safety Studies
 
The safety data from two Company-funded d-methadone Phase 1 clinical safety studies and a third study conducted by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center indicate that d-methadone was safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and cancer patients at all projected therapeutic doses tested.
 
In November 2014, Health Canada approved a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) to conduct the first Phase 1 study with d-methadone. This was a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study and was followed by a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study, both in healthy volunteers. The two studies were designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of d-methadone in healthy, opioid-naïve subjects. The SAD study included single escalating oral doses of d-methadone to determine the maximum tolerated dose, defined as the highest dose devoid of unacceptable adverse events. In the MAD study, healthy subjects received daily oral doses of d-methadone for several days to assess its safety, pharmacokinetics and tolerability. In March 2015, we reported that d-methadone demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with no dose limiting side effects after four cohorts were exposed to increasing higher doses. In April 2015, the Company received clearance from Health Canada to continue with dose escalation and explore even higher single doses of d-methadone. In June 2015, the Company successfully completed the SAD study identifying the maximum tolerated dose and subsequently received a No Objection Letter (NOL) from Health Canada to conduct the MAD clinical study in August 2015. The MAD study was completed in January 2016 and the results successfully demonstrated a potential therapeutic dosing regimen for d-methadone with a favorable side effect and tolerability profile. The data from these studies was used to design a Phase 2a study in patients with depression.

d-Methadone In Vivo Study for Depression
 
In May 2016, we announced the results of an in vivo study showing that administration of d-methadone results in antidepressant-like effects in a well-validated animal model of depression, known as the forced swim test (FST), providing preclinical support for its potential as a novel treatment of depression.
 
According to the Journal of Visualized Experiments, the FST is based on the assumption that when placing an animal in a container filled with water, it will first make efforts to escape by swimming or climbing, but eventually will exhibit “immobility” that may be considered to reflect a measure of behavioral despair. This test has been extensively used because it involves the exposure of the animals to stress, which was shown to have a role in the tendency for major depression. Additionally, the FST has been shown to be influenced by some of the factors that are altered by or worsen depression in humans, including changes in food consumption and sleep abnormalities. The main advantages of this procedure are that it is relatively easy to perform and that its results are easily and quickly analyzed. Importantly, the FST’s sensitivity to a broad range of antidepressant drugs makes it a suitable screening test and is one of the most important features leading to its high predictive validity.
 
In the Company’s FST study, male Sprague Dawley rats were administered single doses of placebo, ketamine, or d-methadone on day one (after habituation; 24 hours prior to forced swim testing). At all doses tested, d-methadone significantly decreased immobility of the rats compared to the placebo, suggesting antidepressant-like activity. In addition, the effect of d-methadone on immobility at the two highest doses tested was larger than the effect seen with ketamine. Moreover, the effects of d-methadone in the forced swim test were not caused by a stimulant effect on spontaneous locomotor activity of the rats. Locomotor activity of lab animals is often monitored to assess the behavioral effects of drugs.


In September 2017 we completed two additional in vivo studies to confirm and support the antidepressant-like effect of dextromethadone in validated animal models, the Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test (NSFT) and the Female Urine-Sniffing test (FUST) test. The studies were performed by Professor Ronald S. Duman, Ph.D. at Yale University School of Medicine.
 
For FUST, rats are first exposed to a cotton tip dipped in tap water and later exposed to another cotton tip infused with fresh female urine. Male behavior was video recorded and total time spent sniffing the cotton-tipped applicator is determined. For NSFT, rats were food deprived for 24 hr and then placed in an open field with food pellets in the center; latency to eat is recorded in seconds. As a control, food consumption in the home cage is quantified. Rats were administered vehicle, ketamine or d-methadone.
 
The results of the FUST demonstrate that administration of ketamine significantly increases the time male rats spent engaged in sniffing female urine compared to vehicle group. Similarly, a single dose of d-methadone significantly increased the time spent sniffing female urine compared to vehicle. In contrast, ketamine or d-methadone had no effect on time sniffing water, demonstrating that the effect of drug treatment was specific to the rewarding effects of female urine. The results of the NSFT demonstrate that a single dose of ketamine significantly decreases the latency to eat in a novel open field. Similarly, a single dose of d-methadone also significantly decreased the latency to enter and eat in the novel feed. In contrast, neither ketamine nor methadone influenced latency to feed in the home cage.
 
These findings demonstrate that ketamine and d-methadone produce rapid antidepressant actions in the FUST and NSFT, effects that are only observed after chronic administration of an SSRI antidepressant.
 
A separate in vitro electrophysiology study of d-methadone was conducted using 2 subtypes of cloned human NMDA receptors.
 
The results of this study demonstrated functional antagonist activity with d-methadone comparable to that of both racemic ketamine and the isomer [S]-ketamine.
 
Phase 2 Program for d-Methadone in Depression
 
Combined with the results of our Phase 1 studies, the encouraging results of in vivo and in vitro studies strongly support further evaluation of d-methadone in a Phase 2 study as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Relmada filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the Phase 2 study with the FDA, which was accepted on January 25, 2017.
 
On April 13, 2017, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation for d-methadone (REL-1017 dextromethadone) for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. The purpose, according to the FDA, is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier. Drugs that receive Fast Track designation may be eligible for more frequent meetings and written communications with the FDA, accelerated review and priority approval, and rolling New Drug Application (NDA) review.
 
On January 17, 2018, we announced that Relmada had acquired the global rights to develop and market dextromethadone for the treatment of neurological conditions including certain rare diseases with symptoms affecting the CNS.
 
In February 2018, Relmada initiated its Phase 2 study of d-methadone in patients with major depressive disorder.
 
In July 2019, Relmada announced the completion of dosing of the last patient in its Phase 2 study of d-methadone in patients with major depressive disorder.

d-Methadone (dextromethadone, REL-1017) in other indications 
 
In addition to developing dextromethadone in major depression, Relmada is initiating work in additional indications. In particular, we have initiated a preclinical program to test the potential efficacy of dextromethadone in Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder with high unmet need caused by Mecp2 gene mutation. Loss of Mecp2 disrupts synaptic function and structure and neuronal networks. Rett syndrome is an Orphan Disease affecting ~15,000 in U.S., primarily girls, with no approved therapy. The disease begins with a short period of developmental stagnation, then rapid regression in language and motor skills, followed by long-term stability.
 
Studies of ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist with mechanistic similarities with dextromethadone, in Rett Syndrome mouse models show that low-dose ketamine acutely reverses multiple disease manifestations and chronic administration of ketamine improves Rett Syndrome progression, providing a solid rationale to pursue this indication with dextromethadone.
 
Other indications that Relmada may explore in the future, potentially includes restless leg syndrome, and other glutamatergic system activation related diseases.
 
In January 2018, we entered into an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (the Assignment Agreement) and License Agreement (the “License Agreement” and together with the Assignment Agreement, the Agreements) with Dr. Charles E. Inturrisi and Dr. Paolo Manfredi (collectively, the Licensor). Pursuant to the Agreements, Relmada assigned its existing rights, including patents and patent applications, to d-methadone in the context of psychiatric use (the Existing Invention) to Licensor. Licensor then granted Relmada under the License Agreement a perpetual, worldwide, and exclusive license to commercialize the Existing Invention and certain further inventions regarding d-methadone in the context of other indications such as those contemplated above.
 
LevoCap ER (REL-1015)
 
LevoCap ER (REL-1015) is a novel version of a proven drug product. LevoCap ER -is an extended release, abuse deterrent, and proprietary formulation of levorphanol (levo-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan), a unique, broad spectrum opioid with additional “non-opioid” mechanisms of action. In particular, levorphanol binds to all three opioid receptor subtypes involved in analgesia (mu, kappa, and delta), the NMDA receptor, and the norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake pumps, whereas morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other opioids are highly selective for the mu receptor subtype. Due to its multi-modal mechanism of action, levorphanol could achieve analgesia in patients resistant to other strong opioids. In clinical studies, levorphanol has demonstrated a remarkably broad spectrum of analgesic activity against many different types of pain including neuropathic pain, post-surgical pain, and chronic pain in patients refractory to other opioids.
 
Levorphanol is a potent opioid analgesic first introduced in the U.S. around 1953 for the treatment of moderate to severe pain where an opioid analgesic is appropriate. Extended-release (long-acting opioid) agents may be preferable to immediate release formulations due to better patient adherence, less dose-watching, and result in improved sleep. Both immediate- and extended-release opioids can potentially be crushed to produce concentrated drug with greater appeal to abusers. Intentional crushing or extracting the active ingredient from the extended-release dosage form by addicts and recreational drug users can destroy the timed-release mechanism and result in a rapid surge of drug into the bloodstream for the purpose of achieving a high or euphoric feeling. Serious side effects and death have been reported from such misuse.

LevoCap ER is the first product candidate utilizing SECUREL™, Relmada’s proprietary abuse deterrent extended release technology for opioid drugs. SECUREL dosage forms cannot be easily crushed for inhalation or to obtain rapid euphoria from high blood levels when swallowed. It is also exceedingly difficult for intravenous abusers to extract the active drug from the dosage form using common solvents, including alcohol.
 
LevoCap ER can be developed under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Following an exchange of correspondence and meeting with the FDA in January 2017, we have defined a path forward for the Phase 3 clinical study for LevoCap ER and a new drug application (NDA) filing. In light of the promising data generated by Relmada’s d-methadone research program, and Relmada’s focus on the d-methadone program, Relmada is currently limiting the investments in LevoCap ER.
 
BuTab (REL-1028)
 
BuTab (REL-1028) represents a novel formulation of oral, modified release buprenorphine as a potential therapeutic for both chronic pain and opioid dependence. Buprenorphine has been widely used by the sublingual and transdermal routes of administration, but was believed to be ineffective by the oral route because of poor oral bioavailability. We have completed a preclinical program to better define the pharmacokinetic profile of BuTab and to assess the time course of systemic absorption of buprenorphine using several different oral modified release formulations of buprenorphine in dogs, compared to an intravenous administration. Based on the results of this work, we obtained approval from Health Canada and initiated a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers in the second quarter of 2015. This trial was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The absolute bioavailability of BuTab relative to intravenous (IV) administration exceeded published data with non-modified buprenorphine when administered orally and compares favorably with a currently marketed transdermal patch. There were no safety or tolerability issues. The data generated by this study will guide formulation optimization and inform the design of subsequent clinical pharmacology studies. BuTab can be developed under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. In light of the promising data generated by Relmada’s d-methadone research program, and Relmada’s focus on the d-methadone program, Relmada is currently limiting the investments in BuTab.
 
MepiGel (REL-1021)
 
MepiGel (REL-1021), is a proprietary topical dosage form of the local anesthetic mepivacaine for the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathies, such as painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia and painful HIV-associated neuropathy. Mepivacaine is an anesthetic (numbing medicine) that blocks the nerve impulses that send pain signals to the brain. It is chemically related to bupivacaine but pharmacologically related to lidocaine. Mepivacaine is currently indicated for infiltration, nerve block and epidural anesthesia. Relmada has received two FDA Orphan Drug Designations for mepivacaine, one each for “the treatment of painful HIV-associated neuropathy” and for “the management of postherpetic neuralgia,” or PHN. We have selected the formulations to be advanced into clinical studies for MepiGel after the evaluation of results from in vitro and ex vivo studies comparing various topical prototypes of mepivacaine that were conducted by MedPharm Ltd, a specialist formulation development company recognized internationally for its expertise in topical and transdermal products. Multiple toxicology studies were successfully conducted and completed in 2015. MepiGel can be developed under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. In light of the promising data generated by Relmada’s d-methadone research program, and Relmada’s focus on the d-methadone program, Relmada is currently limiting the investments in MepiGel.

Overview of the 505(b)(2) Pathway
 
Part of our strategy is the utilization of FDA’s 505(b)(2) NDA for approval. The 505(b)(2) NDA is one of three FDA drug approval pathways and represents an appealing regulatory strategy for many companies. The pathway was created by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, with 505(b)(2) referring to a section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The provisions of 505(b)(2) were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (reference or listed) drug; the section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant.
 
A 505(b)(2) NDA contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This can result in a much less expensive and much faster route to approval, compared with a traditional development path [such as 505(b)(1)], while creating new, differentiated products with tremendous commercial value.
 
Overview of Orphan Drug Status
 
In accordance with laws and regulations pertaining to the Regulatory Agencies, a sponsor may request that the Regulatory Agencies designate a drug intended to treat a “Rare Disease or Condition” as an “Orphan Drug.” For example, in the United States, a “Rare Disease or Condition” is defined as one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to 7 years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. In Europe, this exclusivity is 10 years, and in Australia it is 5 years. However, orphan drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with such as the disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
Our Corporate History and Background
 
We are a clinical-stage, publicly traded biotechnology company developing NCEs together with novel versions of proven drug products that potentially address areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of depression and other CNS diseases.
 
Currently, none of our drugs have been approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere. We have no commercial products nor do we have a sales or marketing infrastructure. In order to market and sell our products we must conduct clinical trials on patients and obtain regulatory approvals from appropriate regulatory agencies, like the FDA in the United States, and similar organizations elsewhere in the world.
 
We have not generated revenues and do not anticipate generating revenues for the foreseeable future. We had net loss of approximately $17,318,000 and $8,961,000 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. At June 30, 2019, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $111,662,000.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy is to leverage our considerable industry experience, understanding of CNS markets and development expertise to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates with significant market potential that can fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of depression. We have assembled a management team along with both scientific and business advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of depression, with significant industry and regulatory experience to lead and execute the development and commercialization of d-methadone.
 
We plan to further develop d-methadone as the priority program for the Company. As the drug d-methadone is a NCE, the regulatory pathway to approval will consist of conducting a full clinical development program. Depending on the resources available to us, we may also develop REl-1028, REl-1015, REL-1021 via the 505(b)(2) development pathway and also to gain exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act for new indications and also orphan drug designation in certain indications. We plan to also generate intellectual property (IP) that will further protect our products from competition. We will continue to prioritize our product development activities after taking into account the resources we have available, market dynamics and potential for adding value. We will continue to outsource development of our products, while retaining scientific, operational and financial oversight and control.
 
We intend to seek and execute licensing and/or co-development agreements with companies capable of supporting the final stage development of the Company’s products and their subsequent commercialization in the U.S. and international markets.

We may in-license late-stage or approved drugs to accelerate the pathway to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with commercial capability. Alternatively, we might consider a trade sale of our products or the entire company if we deem that it is in the best interests of our shareholders.
 
Market Opportunity
 
We believe that the market for addressing areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of CNS diseases will continue to be large for the foreseeable future and that it will represent a sizable revenue opportunity for Relmada. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that CNS diseases affect nearly 2 billion people globally, making up approximately 40% of total disease burden (based on disability adjusted life years), compared with 13% for cancer and 12% for cardiovascular disease. We also believe that each of our product candidates is designed to have value added features that will provide product related competitive advantages versus the existing drugs available on the market.
 
The depression treatment market is segmented on the basis of antidepressants drugs, devices, and therapies. Antidepressants are the largest and most popular market segment. According to Research and Markets, every year more than 5 billion antidepressant prescriptions are written globally. The antidepressants segment consists of large pharmaceutical and generic companies, such as Eli Lily, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Allergan, Sage Therapeutics and Johnson & Johnson. Some of the popular drugs produced by these companies are Cymbalta® (Eli Lily), Effexor® (Pfizer), Pristiq® (Pfizer), Zulresso (Sage) and Spravato (Johnson & Johnson).
 
Intellectual Property Portfolio and Market Exclusivity
 
We have secured three Orphan Drug Designations from the FDA: 1) d-methadone for “the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia”; 2) MepiGel for “the treatment of painful HIV-associated neuropathy”; and MepiGel for “the management of postherpetic neuralgia.” Each would, upon NDA approval, carry 7-year FDA Orphan Drug marketing exclusivity. In the European Union, some of our products may be eligible up to 10 years of market exclusivity, which includes 8 years data exclusivity and 2 years market exclusivity. In addition to any granted patents, our products will be eligible for market exclusivity to run concurrently with the term of the patent for 3 years in the U.S. (Hatch Waxman plus pediatric exclusivity) and up to 10 years of in the E.U. We believe an extensive intellectual property estate of several patents will protect our technology and products once our patent applications for our products are approved.

Competition Overview
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future. Most of our competitors are large, well-established pharmaceutical or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with our products. Our products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products.
 
Regarding our competitive position in the industry, none of our products have been approved for sale.
 
Currently, there are no oral FDA-approved therapies for TRD with the mechanism of action of d-methadone. Johnson & Johnson’s Spravato (esketamine nasal spray) has been recently approved for the treatment of TRD however it needs to be taken under the supervision of a healthcare provider in a healthcare setting. Products approved for other indications, for example, low doses of the anesthetic ketamine, are being or may be increasingly used off-label for treating depression, as well as other CNS indications for which d-methadone may have therapeutic potential. Additionally, other treatment options, such psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy, are sometimes used instead of and before antidepressant medications to treat patients with TRD.

In the field of new generation antidepressants focused on specifically blocking the NMDA receptor channel, our principal competitor is intranasal esketamine, an isomer of ketamine, developed by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals and approved in the United States in March 2019. Other potential competitors focused on modulation of the NMDA receptor at its glycine co-agonist site include VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc. that is developing AV-101, an orally available prodrug candidate that gains access to the CNS after systemic administration and is rapidly converted in the brain into its active metabolite, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), a well-characterized, potent and highly selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor at the glycine co-agonist site. Vistagen is currently conducting a multicenter Phase 2 study for the adjunctive use of oral AV-101 for MDD in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy.
 
Government Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, controlled substances and finished pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by Relmada.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under the FDCA, as amended and regulations pursuant to the FDCA.
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), a division of the Department of Justice, administers the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970, as amended. The CSA imposes various registration, record-keeping and reporting requirements, procurement and manufacturing quotas, import and export controls, labeling and packaging requirements, security controls, and a restriction on prescription refills on certain pharmaceutical products.
 
To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure of companies to maintain compliance, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action including civil and criminal penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations, or initiating proceedings to revoke those registrations. If a manufacturer or distributor has its registration revoked, it can no longer lawfully possess or distribute controlled substances meaning effectively that the operations of such an organization must cease with respect to controlled substances. In certain circumstances, violations also can lead to criminal proceedings.
 
Most states impose similar controls over controlled substances under state law as regulated by the Board of Pharmacy or other state regulatory authorities.
 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also regulate certain pharmaceutical marketing practices. Thus, reimbursement practices of the HHS covering medicine and medical services are important to the success of our products.
 
We are also subject to United States regulation under the CSA. DEA regulations require Scheduled II controlled substances to be manufactured in the United States if the products are to be marketed in the United States. Our only products that contain Schedule II controlled substances are LevoCap ER and d-methadone. We are in the process of transferring all third party manufacturing of these products to the United States, and we intend to comply with this CSA requirement.
 
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.

Failure to comply with applicable FDA, DEA, FTC, HHS and other federal and state regulations and requirements, both before and after drug approval may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and/or criminal prosecution.
 
Please see “Company Overview” above for a status of our drug development.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the United States are subject to the FDCA as implemented and enforced by the FDA. Certain of our product candidates in the United States require FDA pre-marketing approval of an NDA pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 314. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market these products.
 
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, the DEA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to: untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for NDA premarket approval of new products or modified products; withdrawing NDA approvals that have already been granted; refusal to grant export approval for our products; or criminal prosecution.
