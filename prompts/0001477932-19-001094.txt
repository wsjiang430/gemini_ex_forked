Business Overview
 
We design, engineer and assemble micro-wave component based amplifiers that meet individual customer specifications. Our products consists of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assembly designs. We also offer non-recurring engineering services on a project-by-project basis, for a predetermined fixed contractual amount, or on a time plus material basis.
Our Corporate History and Background
 
AmpliTech Group Inc. (“AmpliTech” or “the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010. On August 13, 2012, the Company acquired AmpliTech Inc., by issuing 16,675,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the shareholders of Amplitech Inc. in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of AmpliTech Inc. (“the Share Exchange”). After the Share Exchange, the selling shareholders owned 1,200,000 shares of the outstanding 17,785,000 shares of Company common stock, resulting in a change in control. Accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which AmpliTech, Inc. was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the operations of the Company were consolidated for accounting purposes. The capital balances have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse acquisition.
 
AmpliTech designs, engineers and assembles micro-wave component based low noise amplifiers (“LNA”) that meet individual customer specifications. Application of the Company’s proprietary technology results in maximum frequency gain with minimal background noise distortion as required by each customer. The Company has both domestic and international customers in such industries as aerospace, governmental, defense and commercial satellite. 
 
Our Products
 
Our products consist of RF amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including Low Noise Amplifiers, Medium Power Amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and custom assembly designs. 
 
New to our list of products is the 18 to 40 GHz wide band low noise amplifier. It is designed mainly for wideband telecommunications such as military and space applications, point to point radios as well as test equipment.
 
AmpliTech has also introduced a new line of cryogenic amplifiers designed to operate at temperatures as low as 4K that offer much lower Noise Figures than our standard models and some of the lowest Noise Figures in the industry. Consuming as little DC power as +0.5V DC@8mA, the light-weight, compact housings provide excellent performance while generating very little heat. These amplifiers are very useful for applications that require the absolute minimum amounts of noise injection for the growing market of Low Temperature Applications, such as Quantum Computing, Medical Applications, RF Imaging, Research & Development, Space Communications, Accelerators, Radiometry and Telephony.
 
Low Noise Amplifiers
 
Low Noise Amplifiers, or LNAs, are amplifiers used in receivers of almost every type of communication system (Wi-Fi, Radar, Satellite, Base station, Cell phone, Radio, etc.) to improve signal strength and increase sensitivity and range of receivers. 
Medium Power Amplifiers
 
Medium Power Amplifers, or MPAs, provide increased output power and gain in transceiver chains to increase signal power and maintain dynamic range and linearity in Radars, Base-stations, Wireless networks, and almost every communication system.
Oscillators
 
Phase Locked Oscillators, or PLOs, and Dielectric Resonator Oscillators, or DROs, are ultra-stable frequency sources and references in transceiver applications that complement the amplifier chain in the transceivers.
Filters
 
Filters discriminate or block out certain frequencies in communication systems to improve dynamic range and NF response. Our filters are low loss and used on the front-end of the receiver chain that provide low degradation in the NF of the system, thereby maintaining and enhancing the signal clarity.

Our Technology
 
Our products are supported by hybrid design topologies that create highly linear Radio Frequency (RF) products that amplify and transform signals with minimal addition of noise, achieving high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and increased receiver sensitivity and range, at a low cost and low power consumption. Our hybrid design topologies include:

· | Discrete Microwave Integrated Circuit (MIC) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------
· | Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (PHEMT)
· | MIC and Low Noise MIC 

 
The discrete topology that we utilize provides various advantages:
 

· | Can easily optimize Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) and Noise Figure 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Flexibility of design; can easily adapt to change of specs, technology, etc.
· | Low DC power consumption 
· | Can control and optimize gain flatness due to discrete gain stages 


· | Optimum use of MIC technology and experience
--+---------------------------------------------
· | Use of negative bias is not necessary 
· | Better part availability 

 
Our research and development activities are conducted on new product designs to the extent as requested by the customers. The cost of our research and development activities is incorporated into the unit selling prices and, as such, is borne directly by the customers. For the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has incurred research and development costs of $42,941and $68,447, respectively.
