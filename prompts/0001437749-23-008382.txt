ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview
 
We develop, produce, market and distribute premium beverages that we sell and distribute primarily in the United States and Canada through our network of independent distributors and directly to our national and regional retail accounts. We also sell products in select international markets. Our products are sold in grocery stores, convenience and gas stores, on fountain in restaurants, “up and down the street” in independent accounts such as delicatessens, sandwich shops and burger restaurants, as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers. We refer to our network of independent distributors as our direct store delivery (“DSD”) channel, and we refer to our national and regional accounts who receive shipments directly from us as our direct to retail (“DTR”) channel. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party contract manufacturers. We also sell various products online, including soda with customized labels, wearables, candy and other items, and we license our trademarks for use on products sold by other manufacturers. In addition, during 2022 we developed and began to sell THC infused cannabis products under the “Mary Jones” brand name.
 
Our company is a Washington corporation formed in 2000 as a successor to Urban Juice and Soda Company Ltd., a Canadian company formed in 1986. Our principal place of business is located at 4786 1st Avenue South, Suite 103, Seattle, WA 98134. Our telephone number is (206) 624-3357.
 
Jones Soda Products
 
Our strategy is to continue to focus on our core brand, Jones Soda, while also investing in additional initiatives, including Mary Jones cannabis infused sodas and syrups, fountain related beverages, and Lemoncocco. Our product line-up currently consists of the following:
Jones Soda
 
Jones Soda is our premium carbonated soft drink. We sell Jones Soda in premium glass bottles and cans, with labels featuring photos sent to us by our consumers. Over one million photos have been submitted to us. We believe this unique interaction with our consumers distinguishes our brand and offers a strong competitive advantage for Jones Soda. Additionally, we release various label campaigns that celebrate our consumers and the positive impact such consumers have on the world. Equally differentiating are the distinctive names of our products such as FuFu Berry, and the fact that our products are made from high quality ingredients, including cane sugar and natural colors and flavors when possible. We also sell Jones Soda in more traditional flavors such as Cream Soda, Root Beer and Orange & Cream.
Fountain
 
Drawing inspiration from our traditional bottles, our fountain equipment and cups are branded with an engaging collage of consumer-submitted photos that are inspired by the business themes of our retail partners and the regions in which they are located. Our fountain offerings include traditional flavors such as Cane Sugar Cola, Sugar Free Cola, as well as cane sugar sweetened Ginger Ale, Orange & Cream, Root Beer and Lemon Lime. Rounding out the lineup are two of our most popular cane sugar flavors, Berry Lemonade and Green Apple. We have developed other products in select markets that include teas, lemonade, vitamin enhanced waters, hydration beverages, as well as naturally flavored sparkling waters.
 
We continue to see growing interest from larger quick service restaurants, corporate accounts, retailers, celebrity chefs and a variety of other outlets looking for differentiated offerings in their fountain soda. We feel that Jones on fountain enhances the consumer experience, while appealing to a broad demographic. We believe our national brand awareness and customer-centric approach make us unique compared to other craft soda competitors within this category.
 
Mary Jones
 
We currently market and sell in California the following products under the Mary Jones brand name:  10mg Cannabis-Infused sodas, 100mg cannabis-infused soda packaged in a 16oz, 10-serving can; and a 100mg syrup cannabis tincture designed for mixing with other drinks, using as a food topping or sipping; are now available in California. The flavor of these beverages are based on the Jones Soda original flavors. The new Mary Jones products continue Jones Soda's tradition of using photographs submitted by consumers on their bottle labels and printing quotes from fans under the bottle caps. 
 
We currently intend to  expand both the products offered under the Mary Jones brand as well as the number states we offer such cannabis infused products in.
 
Lemoncocco
 
We officially launched Lemoncocco® in 2016. Lemoncocco represents an entirely new beverage category that was inspired by the distinctive refreshment stands found along the streets of Rome, Italy. Lemoncocco is a premium non-carbonated, naturally flavored beverage with the extracts of Sicilian lemons and a splash of coconut cream. Lemoncocco is lightly sweetened with a touch of cane sugar and only 90 calories per 12-ounce serving. Lemoncocco was designed to be on trend, beautifully bold in design and yield a higher gross profit margin than our current Jones bottle product offerings upon achieving a certain threshold of sales. We feel that Lemoncocco is an ideal choice for food pairing, making cocktails and hydration. We believe the overall appeal to the health channel and a wider age demographic makes Lemoncocco an exciting and diverse offering in the marketplace.

Co-Brand and Private Label Products
 
From time to time, when opportunities meet our required financial and operational metrics, we utilize our industry expertise to provide private label products for customers.
 
Sparkling Beverage Industry 
 
Our Jones Soda beverages are classified in the sparkling beverage category, which encompasses carbonated soft drinks (CSD) and craft sodas. According to a December 2022 special issue of Research and Markets, The World’s Largest Market Research Store, The size of the world's craft soda industry was estimated at $641.24 million in 2021, and it is anticipated to rise to $768.08 million by 2027. "Craft sodas" refers to sodas produced in smaller quantities and using more natural ingredients.

Product Distribution and Sales Strategy
 
Premium Soda Beverages 
 
Our core products are distributed and sold throughout the United States and Canada and in select international markets. Our primary distribution channels are our direct store delivery (DSD) channel (sales and distribution through our network of independent distributors) and our direct to retail (DTR) channel (sales directly to national and regional retail accounts). We also have our online channel for internet sales of various products. We strategically build our national and regional retailer network by focusing on distribution systems that we believe will provide top-line drivers for our products and increased availability and visibility of our products in our core markets. In building and expanding our DSD channel, we also consider international markets and look for regions that data suggests have a high affinity for the Jones brand and can be pursued within our financial resources.
 
Part of our strategy in building our distribution system is to blend our DSD and DTR distribution channels, delivering different offerings through alternate channels. In addition to determining the most advantageous distribution channel, we work to ensure that our products are placed on shelves that are normally restricted to national mainstream brands and in the cold-aisle of stores, thus providing us access to the important “take home market.” We have also introduced the JONES Cane Sugar Fountain program through a network of fountain distributors in select regions across the United States and Canada to provide our premium products and uniquely customized fountain equipment.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, A. Lassonde Inc. (“Lassonde”), one of our independent distributors and our top account by revenue represented approximately 20% of revenue. We intend to continue to expand our distributor network and DTR accounts, which we hope will result in a decreased dependence on any one or more of our independent distributors or national retail accounts.
 
We contract with independent trucking companies to have our product shipped from our contract manufacturers to independent warehouses and then on to our distributors and national retail accounts. Distributors then sell and deliver our products either to sub-distributors or directly to retail accounts. We recognize revenue upon receipt by our distributors and national account customers of our products, net of discounts and promotional allowances, and all sales are final; however, in limited instances, due to credit issues, quality or damage issues, or distributor changes, we may accept returned product, which to date has not been material.

DSD (direct store delivery)
 
We maintain a network of independent distributors across the United States and Canada. We have also secured distribution in select international markets and are evaluating other international opportunities for our products. We choose our distributors based on our perception of their ability to build our brand franchise in convenience stores, grocery stores, on fountain in restaurants and “up and down the street” in independent accounts such as delicatessens and sandwich shops.
 
Typically, we grant our independent distributors exclusive distribution rights in defined territories, which may include invasion fees in the event we provide any of our products directly to one of our national retailers located in the distributor’s region. We are also obligated to pay termination fees for cancellations of most of these written distributor agreements, unless the termination is for “cause. For example, we are party to a distribution agreement with Lassonde that, unless earlier terminated by either party for “cause,” currently renews on an annual basis, unless either party gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the agreement not less than 90 days prior to the commencement of the next renewal term. The distribution agreement grants Lassonde the exclusive right to sell our products throughout Canada, subject to certain exceptions for our national accounts, and imposes certain requirements on Lassonde, including obligations related to maintaining inventory levels and providing certain reports and prohibits “dumping” activities.
 
We intend to continue our efforts to reinforce and expand our distribution network by partnering with new distributors and replacing underperforming distributors. In addition to the efforts of our independent distributors in obtaining distribution of our products, we actively seek to obtain listings for our products with key retail grocery, convenience and mass merchandiser accounts, which are serviced through our independent distributor network.
 
Product availability at a specific store location for any of our retailers is subject to the retailer preference, consumer demand, and localized store variances. To find a retailer that carries our products, our product locator is available on our website under “Store Locator.”
 
DTR (direct to retail)
 
Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains and retail accounts, including convenience store chains, mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs, we negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products, and the account is serviced through the retailer’s appointed distribution system (rather than through our DSD network). These arrangements are terminable at any time by these retailers or us, and contain no minimum purchase commitments or termination fees.
 
Co-Brand and Private Label
 
We offer private label products directly to retailers. Our expertise in innovation and managing the manufacturing process allow for efficiencies for both us and the customer. We are able to produce these products with minimal sell through risk and ship them through our network of independent trucking companies or a preferred partner of the customer.
 
Fountain Distribution
 
We sell direct to certain retailers in addition to working with a network of fountain distributors in select focus regions within the United States and Canada to provide our premium products, including our fountain and slush products, and uniquely customized fountain equipment.
Sales
 
Our premium beverage products are sold throughout the United States and Canada, primarily in grocery stores, convenience and gas stores, on fountain in restaurants and “up and down the street” in independent accounts such as delicatessens, sandwich shops and burger restaurants as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers. In 2022, sales in the United States represented approximately 80% of total sales, while sales in Canada represented approximately 19% (primarily through our distributor relationship with Lassonde), and we had approximately 1% in other international sales.

Our Premium Soda Brands
 
Building our Brand
 
We have built our brand to a large extent on our fun and independent image as well as by providing what we believe to be unique and exciting flavors that appeal to consumers who prefer alternatives to the corporate carbonated soft drink brands. We believe this market is driven by trendy, young consumers looking for a distinctive tonality and better ingredients in their beverage choices. While we are known for our unique and innovative flavors, we also feature traditional flavors and feel that our broad appeal helps position us as a leader in the growing premium craft segment of the industry. Additionally, through the labels on our bottles and our invitation to consumers to send in photographs to be featured on the Jones Soda labels, we focus on building brand loyalty and customer engagement. We select photos throughout the year to be placed on our bottles and cans for distribution, and also invite consumers to celebrate special occasions and memories by creating their own label through myJones.com. In that space, consumers have the ability to customize their own label and product with a photo and short caption using a proprietary patented process.
 
We continue to attempt to “bring our labels to life” with a series of augmented reality labels showcasing extreme athletes and artists in action that we believe builds on Jones Soda’s long-time association with action sports and creators of all kinds, involving influencers ranging from a gravity-defying professional scooter rider with 150,000 Instagram followers to a tattoo artist, jewelry designer and street muralist. These labels are “brought to life” with a new Jones Soda app that shoppers simply download the Jones Soda app and use their phone camera to scan the image on any bottle carrying a “Reel Label” icon. The scan triggers a short video bringing the viewer inside the unique world of its creator, whether he or she is painting a mural in time-lapse or doing a hardflip at the skatepark.
 
In addition to creative labeling on our products, we provide our distributors with point-of-sale promotional materials and branded apparel items. We believe that our labeling, marketing and promotional materials are important elements to creating and increasing consumer appeal, as well as distributor and retailer awareness, and that our branding efforts have helped us achieve strong consumer connections and affinity levels for our products.
 
Brand Marketing
 
Our marketing team has developed brand positioning and brand identity that is an integral asset and we believe allows our brand to be widely known in a positive way among a large demographic. We have focused on positioning ourselves as an alternative to mainstream soda brands and try to focus on locations where such brands areare not sold. We also have a program of sponsoring alternative sport athletes to promote our products in youth alternative sports, including Ultimate Fighting Championship, auto-racing, skateboarding, BMX biking, snowboarding and skiing. In addition, we completed a program of sponsoring up-and-coming musicians and artists. We believe this effort to position our products in alternative accounts and venues helps draw a younger generation of customers that value their independence away from the larger soft drink brands.
Social Media
 
Our core marketing pillar is the open access our consumers have to define the brand through our social media channels and our website at Jonessoda.com. We actively participate in social media campaigns as a way of direct engagement with our consumers in order to listen to their voices and better understand their issues and changes in consumer trends. Social media represents one of the largest shifts in modern business away from static advertising, and we have had success in creating social media hubs through forums such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Our consumers have responded by bringing us onto their social media pages and into their lives, creating a personal connection that we believe helps ensure they are actively engaged with our brand and our products.
 
Consumer-Submitted Photos
 
We are well-known for the consumer submitted photos on our labels and cans. We invite our consumers to send us photos of their lives, and we select from those photos for use on our labels. Photos can be submitted through our website at our “Jones Soda Photo Gallery.” 
 
Customized Photo Labels
 
We also provide our Jones Soda customers, ranging from businesses to end consumers, customized and personalized 12-packs of Jones Soda (in bottles) that they can create with their own photos on the labels. The strategy of this program is to provide a customized and personalized product offering to our consumers as well as an innovative marketing opportunity for our Jones Soda brand. Consumers can upload their photos through our website and create their own “myJones” labels. The personalized labels are downloaded at our headquarters, applied to 12-packs of Jones Soda and delivered to the consumer.
 
We believe our photo strategy has increased awareness for, as well as provided for increased consumer interactivity with, the Jones Soda brand.

Point of Sale and Consumer Awareness
 
We use point-of-sale materials such as posters, stickers, hats and T-shirts to create and increase consumer awareness of our proprietary products and brands. In response to consumer demand, we also sell our products and our wearables on our website. In selected cities, we participate at a “grassroots” level at certain community and sporting events in an attempt to create and increase brand awareness and loyalty. As noted above, we use recreational vehicles, vans and independent distributor vehicles painted with the Jones colors and logos to create consumer awareness and enthusiasm at these events and to assist distributors as they open new retail accounts and markets.
 
From time to time, we partner with companies that will manufacture Jones-related products that we feel extend and enhance our Jones brand. We currently have a licensing arrangement with a third party to manufacture and distribute Jones Soda Flavor Booster hard candy. In addition to these marketing techniques, we also pursue cross-promotional campaigns with other companies.
 
Events
 
In addition to all of the above marketing efforts, we are also investing in various events that are in alignment with our brand demographic. We invest in skateboarding events and partner with like-minded companies that we believe maintain a similar connection to our core demographic. At these events, we are able to display our logo and participate in sampling activities where we encourage the tasting of our products to encourage purchases of our brand at retail establishments where our products are sold. We anticipate investing in more of these events as we focus on marketing efforts in support of our core brand, Jones Soda, subject to any ongoing restrictions that may be imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future pandemics. 
Brand and Product Development - Premium Soda Beverages
 
We understand the importance of creating new beverage products and enhancing our existing products to meet the ever-changing consumer taste profile. We continue to expand our Jones Cane Sugar Fountain program that allows for our Jones Soda product line to be offered “on tap.” We partner with restaurants and grocery stores that prefer to offer new innovative and pure cane sugar fountain opportunities for their guests and we utilize a select group of fountain distributors to service these retail customers.
 
Our strategy is to focus on innovative products that will be accepted by consumers, retailers and distributors. We believe this is accomplished by keeping open dialog directly with our consumers through our website, blogs and social media as well as with our retail and distributor partners to ensure we are current with consumer trends in the beverage industry.
 
We develop the majority of our brands and products in-house. We used a similar process initially to create the Jones Soda brand, and we intend to continue utilizing this process to create our future brands and products. This process primarily consists of the following steps:
 
Market Evaluation.  We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of certain categories and segments of the beverage industry with a view to pinpointing potential opportunities.
 
Financial Evaluation. We evaluate consumer price tolerance and sensitivity. All new products must be able to scale and meet strict margin requirements.
 
Distributor Evaluation.  We analyze existing and potential distribution channels, whether DSD, DTR or a blend of these channels. This analysis addresses, among other things, which companies will distribute particular beverage brands and products, where such companies may distribute such brands and products, and what will motivate these distributors to distribute such brands and products.
Production Evaluation.  We review all aspects of production of our beverages, including contract packing capacity, strategic production locations, and quality control, and prepare a cost analysis of the various considerations that will be critical to producing our brands and products.
Image and Design.  Based on our evaluation of the market, distributors and production issues, we create and develop the concept for a beverage brand, product or product extension. Our technical services department then works with various flavor concentrate houses to test, choose and develop product flavors for the brand.
 
We believe that the ongoing process of creating new brands, products and product extensions will be an important factor in our long-term success. For example, we recently completed a successful Q4 special release programs where we sold the products “Sugar Cookie” and “Turkey and Gravy.” Additionally, in 2022 we partnered with ICEE to create the popular Cherry flavor as the newest entry in our Special Release program featuring limited-edition flavors that combines the familiar Jones Soda label design with the ICEE logo and a whimsical drawing of ICEE’s bear mascot to facilitate brand recognition on the shelf.  We also intend to continue to launch a line of cannabis-infused sodas, syrups and gummies under a new brand, “Mary Jones”.
 
  5 

  

In addition to creating new brands, we believe we need to continuously improve our core product line, Jones Soda, as consumer tastes continue to change. We intend that each new flavor of Jones Soda that we introduce will be made with less sugar and no artificial colors or flavors whenever possible. In addition, we continue to re-formulate and re-introduce lower calorie content versions of each of our existing flavors of Jones Soda as and when we believe we have created an acceptable replacement that will appeal to existing customers and attract new customers.
 
Moreover, in addition to the above extensions to the Jones Soda brand, we have created and launched a brand with its own separate identity from the Jones Soda brand, Lemoncocco®. We believe that Lemoncocco represents a new category in the non-carbonated beverage industry and that developing a separate all-natural beverage brand is an important opportunity for our company.
 
Competition
 
Premium Beverage Industry
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive. Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry include:
 

● | brand name and image;
--+----------------------


● | distribution;
--+--------------


● | shelf-management;
--+------------------


● | licensing;
--+-----------


● | price;
--+-------


● | labeling and packaging;
--+------------------------


● | advertising;
--+-------------


● | product quality and taste;
--+---------------------------


● | trade and consumer promotions; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | development of new brands, products and product extensions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by our distributors, all of whom also distribute other beverage brands. Our products compete with all non-alcoholic beverages, most of which are marketed by companies with substantially greater financial resources than ours. We also compete with regional beverage producers and “private label” soft drink suppliers. Our direct competitors in the sparkling beverage industry include traditional large soft drink manufacturers and distributors as well as regional premium soft drink companies.
 
In order to compete effectively in the beverage industry, from time to time we develop and introduce new products and product extensions.
 
Although we believe that we will be able to continue to create competitive and relevant brands and products to satisfy consumers’ changing preferences, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that other companies will not be more successful in this regard over the long term.
 
Pricing of the products is also important. We believe that our products are priced in the same price range or higher than competitive brands and products, and compete on quality as they are premium product offerings.
 
Cannabis Industry 
 
We facing intense competition in the Cannabis industry from other companies, some of which have longer operating histories and more financial resources and longer history of the production and marketing of cannabis products than then we do. Competitors are primarily branded and private label cannabis companies who are operating in multiple states. We are currently in direct competition with Keef Brands, Cann Social Tonics, and Tonik Beverages, none of which are national consumer packaged goods brands in the United States. We are confident that our cannabis products will be highly competitive. We seek a competitive advantage over our competitors by applying our Mary Jones brand name recognition and by offering quality cannabis products to our loyal customer base. Because of the early stage of the cannabis industry in the United States and Canada, we also face additional competition from new entrants. If the number of users of medical and recreational cannabis increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products and pricing strategies. To remain competitive, the believe we will be required to make a high level of investment in our planned licenses, partnerships, branding, products and technologies, distribution, research and development, marketing, sales and client support. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain its marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations of our planned cannabis business.

Production
 
Contract Packing Arrangements
 
We do not directly manufacture our premium soda beverage products, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). We currently use primary co-packers located in Canada and the United States. Once the product is manufactured, the finished products are stored either at the co-packer’s location or in nearby third-party warehouses. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production batch or “run” for most co-packers, we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time, in which case we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We continually review our contract packing needs in light of regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs.
Raw Materials
 
The raw materials used in the manufacturing of our premium soda beverage products consist primarily of concentrate, flavors, supplements, sugar, bottles, cans, labels, trays, caps and packaging. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our bottle and can products are purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. These raw materials are purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials, which are available from multiple suppliers.
 
We purchase flavor concentrate from our suppliers. Generally, flavor concentrate suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. Although we do not have the list of ingredients or formulas for our flavors, we have exclusive rights to the use of the flavor concentrates developed with our suppliers. In connection with the development of new soda products and flavors, independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. If we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
The costs of raw materials fluctuate and in certain instances we enter into supply agreements to address these risks. We have a three-year fixed price supply agreement with our primary glass supplier which expires at the end of 2023. The price of glass continues to increase each year due to the shortage of available glass in the industry; however, our supply agreement with our glass supplier provides us with some price protection through 2023.
 
As the global supply chain continues to see disruptions, there is higher risk for continued labor shortages, raw material cost increases, and increased costs of transportation that could adversely impact our business. The extent to which the global supply chain disruptions may continue to impact our results of operations, including the long-term nature of the impact, depends on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. 
 
Quality Control
 
Our premium soda beverage products are made from high-quality ingredients and natural and artificial flavors. We seek to ensure that all of our products satisfy our high-quality standards. Contract manufacturers are selected and monitored by our quality control representatives in an effort to ensure adherence to our production procedures and quality standards.
 
For every batch or “run” of product, our contract manufacturer undertakes extensive testing of product quality and packaging. This includes testing levels of sweetness, carbonation, taste, product integrity, packaging and various regulatory cross checks. Samples from each production run are analyzed and categorized in a reference library. For each product, the contract manufacturer must transmit all quality control test results to us for reference following each production run.
 
Testing also includes microbiological checks and other tests to ensure the production facilities meet the standards and specifications of our quality assurance program. Water quality is monitored during production and at scheduled testing times to ensure compliance with beverage industry standards. The water used to produce our products is filtered and is also treated to reduce alkalinity. Flavors are pre-tested by the flavor concentrate supplier before shipment to contract manufacturers. We are committed to ongoing product improvement with a view towards ensuring the high quality of our product through a stringent co-packer selection, training and communication program. 
 
Cannabis Operations
 
During 2022, we began to develop, market and distribute cannabis-infused beverages and syrups under the “Mary Jones” brand name in California to complement our existing soda beverage business. Similar to the manufacturing process with our premium soda products we outsource the manufacturing and distribution of our products to third parties with whom we enter licensing agreement with concerning our cannabis products being manufactured and sold. We operate our cannabis operations in California under newly created California subsidiary that is separate from our current soda beverage business. We currently plan to expand our cannabis operations into other states that have legalized the recreational use of cannabis using a similar structure to our operations in California.

Regulation
 
Premium Beverage Business
 
The production and marketing of our proprietary beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, provincial, state and local health agencies, including in particular Health Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA and AAFC also regulate labeling of our products. From time to time, we may receive notifications of various technical labeling or ingredient reviews with respect to our products. We believe that we have a compliance program in place to ensure compliance with production, marketing and labeling regulations.
 
Legal requirements have been enacted in several jurisdictions in the United States and Canada requiring that deposits or certain eco-taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other beverage container-related deposit, recycling, eco-tax and/or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and Canada. We anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and Canada.
 
Cannabis Business
 
Application of Federal Law
 
Although certain states have legalized either medical marijuana or medical and adult use cannabis, at the federal level, cannabis currently remains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. §§ 811 et seq.). Under United States federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. As such, cannabis related practices or activities, including without limitation, the cultivation, manufacture, importation, possession, use, or distribution of cannabis, remain illegal under United States federal law.
 
Although federally illegal, the U.S. federal government’s approach to enforcement of such laws has trended toward non-enforcement. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all U.S. Attorneys’ offices (federal prosecutors). The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that rigorously comply with state regulatory provisions in states with strictly regulated medical or recreational cannabis programs. While not legally binding, and merely prosecutorial guidance, the Cole Memorandum laid a framework for managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning state regulated marijuana businesses.
 
However, on January 4, 2018 the Cole Memorandum was revoked by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law, as the Cole Memorandum was not itself law, the revocation removed the DOJ’s guidance to U.S. Attorneys that state regulated cannabis industries substantively in compliance with the Cole Memorandum’s guidelines should not be a prosecutorial priority.
 
In addition to his revocation of the Cole Memorandum, Attorney General Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum.” The Sessions Memorandum confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained the rationale of the DOJ in doing so: the Cole Memorandum, according to the Sessions Memorandum, was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (the “USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the federal government’s limited resources, and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.”
 
While the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and reiterates the statutory view that cannabis is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys in deciding whether to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. Our outside U.S. counsel continuously monitors all U.S. Attorney comments related to regulated medical and adult-use cannabis laws to assess various risks and enforcement priorities within each jurisdiction. Dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country have affirmed that their view of federal enforcement priorities has not changed, although a few have displayed greater ambivalence.
 
In his February 2021 confirmation hearing, current Attorney General Merrick Garland affirmed the principles of prosecutorial discretion from the rescinded Cole Memorandum.  He noted that “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana either medically or otherwise.”  Attorney General, Merrick Garland, has not officially indicated any change in enforcement priority for state-compliant marijuana businesses, however, uncertainty regarding federal enforcement remains.

Most recently, on October 6, 2022, President Joe Biden announced a three-step program to bring broad changes to federal cannabis policy.  As an initial step towards reform, President Biden began the process of pardoning all federal offenders convicted of simple cannabis possession.  As a second step, President Biden also encouraged Governors to take similar steps to pardon state simple cannabis possession charges. Finally, President Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services and Attorney General Merrick Garland to “expeditiously” review cannabis’s status as a Schedule I controlled drug pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act. With these positive developments it is important to acknowledge that these policy directives have not yet changed the “laws on the books” and so there remains uncertainty regarding whether such policies and enforcement priorities may change in the future.
 
Regardless, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, and neither the Cole Memorandum nor its rescission has altered that fact. The federal government of the United States has always reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or recreational marijuana, even if state law sanctioned such sale and disbursement. From a regulatory and enforcement perspective, the criminal risk today remains identical to the risk on January 3, 2018. It remains unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered.
 
Additionally, under U.S. federal law it may potentially be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from marijuana sales or any other Schedule I substance. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy. Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a memorandum in February of 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a “suspicious activity report” (“SAR”) as required by federal money laundering laws. These marijuana related SARs are divided into three categories: marijuana limited, marijuana priority, and marijuana terminated, based on the financial institution’s belief that the marijuana business follows state law, is operating out of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated.
 
On the same day the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the “2014 Cole Memo”) directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of marijuana-related conduct. The 2014 Cole Memo has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes was not a DOJ priority.
 
However, Attorney General Sessions’ revocation of the Cole Memorandum and the 2014 Cole Memo has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 Cole Memo and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum can act as a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact.
 
Enforcement Proceedings under Federal Law
 
Although the Cole Memorandum and 2014 Cole Memo have been rescinded, the United States Congress has repeatedly enacted legislation to protect the medical marijuana industry from prosecution. The United States Congress has passed appropriations bills each of the last three years that included the Rohrabacher Amendment Title: H.R.2578 — Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, which by its terms does not appropriate any federal funds to the U.S. DOJ for the prosecution of medical cannabis offenses of individuals who are in compliance with State medical cannabis laws. Subsequent to the issuance of the Sessions Memorandum on January 4, 2018, the United States Congress passed its omnibus appropriations bill, SJ 1662, which for the fourth consecutive year contained the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment language (the “Leahy Amendment”) and continued the protections for the medical cannabis marketplace and its lawful participants from interference by the DOJ up and through the 2018 appropriations deadline of September 30, 2018. The deadline has passed, but the Leahy Amendment has remained in effect by virtue of a series of short-term spending bills signed on September 28, 2018, December 7, 2018, January 25, 2019 and February 8, 2019. On February 15 the amendment was renewed through the signing of the fiscal year 2019 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2019.  On May 16, 2019, a House subcommittee released a base appropriations bill with the amendment included. On September 26, 2019 the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a base appropriations bill with the amendment included. On September 27, 2019 the amendment was renewed through a stopgap spending bill, and again on November 21, 2019.  On December 20, 2019 the amendment was renewed through the signing of the fiscal year 2020 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2020.  In July 2020, a House subcommittee introduced a base appropriations bill with the amendment included.  The amendment was then renewed through a series of stopgap spending bills on October 1, 2020 December 11, 2020 December 18, 2020 December 20, 2020 and December 22, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the amendment was renewed through the signing of the fiscal year 2021 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2021. In 2021, President Joe Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the Leahy Amendment included. The amendment was then renewed through a series of stopgap spending bills on September 30, December 3, February 18,and March 11. On March 15 the amendment was renewed through the signing of the FY 2022 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2022. As of December 29, 2022, the amendment is effective through September 30, 2023.

State Regulatory Environment
 
The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in California, which is the first state where we intend to commence our planned cannabis operations. While we will work to ensure that our operations comply with applicable state laws, regulations, and licensing requirements, for the reasons described above and the risks further described under the heading “Risk Factors”, there are significant risks associated with our planned cannabis business. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read and consider all of the risk factors contained under the heading “Risk Factors” below.
California Regulatory Landscape
 
In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.
 
In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.
 
In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. AUMA had some conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. The four agencies that originally regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), California Department of Food and Agriculture (“DFA”), California Department of Public Health (“DPH”), and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018.
 
On July 1, 2019, California enacted A.B. 97. In relevant part, the bill authorizes licensing authorities to issue citations and fines to a licensee or an unlicensed person who violates MAUCRSA. The maximum fine is $5,000 per violation for licensees and $30,000 per violation for unlicensed persons. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation.
 
A.B. 97 also repeals a prior requirement that an applicant for a provisional license first hold a temporary license. The bill also requires applicants for provisional licenses to submit evidence of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, limits the validity of a provisional license to 12 months with subsequent renewals as approved by the relevant licensing authority, and allows licensing authorities to revoke provisional licenses for failing to diligently pursue final licensure. Finally, the bill requires the DPH to establish a certification program for manufactured cannabis products comparable to the National Organic Program and the California Organic Food and Farming Act.
 
On October 12, 2019, California enacted A.B. 1529. The bill mandates that all cannabis vaping cartridges and cannabis vaporizers must include a universal symbol identifying the product as a vaping product.
 
On July 12, 2021, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 141 (AB-141), which creates the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). The DCC is in the process of consolidating the state’s cannabis program oversight from three of the existing agencies – the BCC, the DFA, and the DPH – under a single department in an effort to centralize and simplify regulatory and licensing oversight in California. DCC similarly announced its intention to create a single Licensing Division that would be responsible for licensing of all cannabis businesses. On or about September 15, 2021, the DCC filed emergency regulations to consolidate, clarify, and make consistent cannabis regulations to the California Office of Administrative Law. After a limited comment period, these consolidated emergency regulations were approved and became effective on or about September 27, 2021. These regulations created consistent standards for cannabis licensees across all license types, by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements. Further consolidated regulations and modifications of existing regulations were issued for public comment on March 4, 2022.
 
At present, to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with marijuana licensing programs. Therefore, cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators or can choose to outright ban marijuana.

California Licensing Requirements
 
A medicinal retailer license permits the sale of medicinal cannabis and cannabis products to a medicinal cannabis patient in California who possesses a physician’s recommendation. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older who presents a valid government-issued photo identification.
 
An adult-use or medicinal cultivation license permits cannabis cultivation activity which means any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and the sales of cannabis to certain licensed entities within the state of California for resale or manufacturing purposes.
 
An adult-use or medical manufacturing license permits the manufacturing of cannabis products. Manufacturing includes the compounding, blending, extracting, infusion, packaging or repackaging, labeling or relabeling, or other preparation of a cannabis product.
 
In the state of California, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. Although California is not a vertically-integrated system, the state allows licensees to make wholesale purchase of cannabis from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state.
 
Holders of marijuana licenses in California are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, sales, manufacturing standards, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations, as promulgated by each applicable state agency, should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area.
 
Licensed cannabis businesses may partner with non-licensed business entities pursuant to intellectual property licensing agreements subject to certain disclosure requirements and approvals by the DCC. 
 
California Dispensary Requirements
 
Cannabis retailers may only sell cannabis products that were received by the retail licensee from a licensed distributor or licensed microbusiness authorized to engage in distribution, and the licensed retailer must verify that the cannabis goods have not exceeded their best-by, sell-by, or expiration date if one is provided. The goods must have undergone appropriate laboratory testing, and the batch number labeled on the package of cannabis goods must match the batch number on the corresponding certificate of analysis for regulatory compliance testing. The packaging and goods must comply with all applicable laws in order for the goods to be sold at the retail location. In addition to cannabis goods, a licensed retailer may sell only cannabis accessories and licensee’s branded merchandise. A licensed retailer may not provide free cannabis goods except for in certain limited circumstances.
 
Cannabis retailers may only display cannabis goods for inspection and sale in the retail area. Such goods may be removed from their packaging and placed in containers to allow for customer inspection, so long as the containers are not readily accessible to customers without assistance of retailer personnel. A container must be provided to the customer by the licensed retailer or its employees, who must remain with the customer at all times that the container is being inspected by the customer. Cannabis goods removed from their packaging in this way may not be sold or consumed. They must be destroyed appropriately when they are no longer being used for display.
 
California Reporting Requirements
 
The state of California uses METRC as the state’s track-and-trace (“T&T”) system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all state-issued annual licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to METRC.

California Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements
 
To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, California’s marijuana businesses are required to do the following:

• | maintain a fully operational security alarm system;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | contract for security guard services;
--+--------------------------------------


• | maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not dispense from its premises outside of permissible hours of operation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | store cannabis and cannabis product only in areas per the premises diagram submitted to the state of California during the licensing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion, or loss of cannabis; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities, maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products. Only vehicles registered with the BCC that meet BCC distribution requirements are to be used to transport cannabis and cannabis products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
DCC Inspections
 
The DCC, and its authorized representatives, shall have full and immediate access to inspect and enter onto any premises licensed by the DCC. Prior notice of an inspection, investigation, review, or audit is not required. The DCC may also test any vehicle or equipment possessed by, in control of, or used by a licensee or their agents and employees for the purpose of conducting commercial cannabis activity. Moreover, it may test any cannabis goods or cannabis-related materials, or products possessed by, in control of, or used by a licensee or their agents and employees for the purpose of conducting commercial cannabis activity. The DCC may also copy any materials, books, or records of any licensee or their agents and employees. Failure to cooperate with and participate in any DCC investigation pending against the licensee may result in a licensing violation subject to discipline.
 
Trademarks, Flavor Concentrate Trade Secrets and Patent Rights
 
In the United States, we own a number of trademark registrations (designated by the ® symbol) and pending trademark applications (designated by the ™ symbol) for use in connection with our products, including “JONES®,” “JONES SODA CO.® “LEMONCOCCO ®” and “ MARY JONES®,”.
 
In general, trademark registrations expire 10 years from the filing date or registration date, with the exception in Canada, where trademark registrations expire 15 years from the registration date. All trademark registrations may be renewed for a nominal fee.
 
Although our flavor concentrate suppliers generally own the proprietary rights to the flavors, we have the exclusive rights to our flavor concentrates developed with our current flavor concentrate suppliers, which we protect as trade secrets. We will continue to take appropriate measures to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our flavor concentrates.
 
We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business.
 
Seasonality
 
Our sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Sales may fluctuate materially on a quarter to quarter basis or an annual basis when we launch a new product or fill the “pipeline” of a new distribution partner or a large retail partner. Sales results may also fluctuate based on the number of stock keeping units or "SKUs" selected or removed by our distributors and retail partners through the normal course of serving consumers in the dynamic, trend-oriented beverage industry. As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the fiscal year.
