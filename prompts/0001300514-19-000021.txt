ITEM 1. — BUSINESS
Our Company
Las Vegas Sands Corp. ("LVSC," or together with its subsidiaries "we" or the "Company") is a Fortune 500 company and the leading global developer of destination properties ("Integrated Resorts") that feature premium accommodations, world-class gaming, entertainment and retail, convention and exhibition facilities, celebrity chef restaurants and other amenities.
We currently own and operate Integrated Resorts in Asia and the United States. We believe our geographic diversity, best-in-class properties and convention-based business model provide us with the best platform in the hospitality and gaming industry to continue generating substantial growth and cash flow while simultaneously pursuing new development opportunities. Our unique convention-based marketing strategy allows us to attract business travelers during the slower mid-week periods while leisure travelers occupy our properties during the weekends. Our convention, trade show and meeting facilities, combined with the on-site amenities offered at our Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas Integrated Resorts, provide flexible and expansive space for conventions, trade shows and other meetings.
We focus on the mass market, which comprises our most profitable gaming segment. We believe the mass market segment will continue to have long-term growth as a result of the introduction of more high-quality gaming facilities and non-gaming amenities into our various markets.
Our properties also cater to VIP and premium players by providing them with luxury amenities and high service levels. The Paiza Club located at our properties is an important part of our VIP gaming marketing strategy. Our Paiza Clubs are exclusive invitation-only clubs available to our premium players that feature high-end services and amenities, including luxury accommodations, restaurants, lounges and private gaming salons. We also offer players club loyalty programs at our properties, which provide access to rewards, privileges and members-only events. Additionally, we believe being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia will provide meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow.
Through our 70.0% ownership of Sands China Ltd. ("SCL"), we own and operate a collection of Integrated Resorts in the Macao Special Administrative Region ("Macao") of the People's Republic of China ("China"). These properties include The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel ("The Venetian Macao"); Sands Cotai Central; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Cotai Strip (the "Four Seasons Hotel Macao"); and the Sands Macao.
In Singapore, we own and operate the iconic Marina Bay Sands, which has become one of Singapore's major tourist, business and retail destinations since its opening in 2010.
Our properties in the United States include The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, a luxury resort on the Las Vegas Strip, and the Sands Expo and Convention Center (the "Sands Expo Center," and together with The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, the "Las Vegas Operating Properties") in Las Vegas, Nevada and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem (the "Sands Bethlehem") in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
We are dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, anchored by the core values of serving people, planet and communities. We strive to deliver a positive working environment for our team members worldwide and pledge to promote the advancement of aspiring team members through a range of educational partnerships, grants and leadership training. We also drive social impact through the Sands Cares charitable giving and community engagement program, and environmental performance through the award-winning Sands ECO360 global sustainability program. Through our Sands ECO360 global sustainability program, we develop and implement environmental practices to protect natural resources, offer our team members a safe and healthy work environment, and enhance the resort experiences of our guests. We are committed to creating and investing in industry-leading policies and procedures to safeguard our patrons, partners, employees and neighbors. Our industry-leading Integrated Resorts provide substantial contributions to our host communities including growth in leisure and business tourism, sustained job creation and ongoing financial opportunities for local small and medium-sized businesses.
LVSC was incorporated in Nevada in August 2004. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "LVS." Our principal executive office is located at 3355 Las Vegas Boulevard South,

Our principal operating and developmental activities occur in three geographic areas: Macao, Singapore and the United States. Management reviews the results of operations for each of its operating segments, which generally are our Integrated Resorts. In Macao, our operating segments are: The Venetian Macao; Sands Cotai Central; The Parisian Macao; The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao; and Sands Macao. In Singapore, our operating segment is Marina Bay Sands. In the United States, our operating segments are the Las Vegas Operating Properties and Sands Bethlehem. We also have ferry operations and various other operations that are ancillary to our Macao properties (collectively, "Ferry Operations and Other") that we present to reconcile to our consolidated statements of operations and financial condition. In addition to our reportable segments noted above, management also reviews construction and development activities for each of our primary projects currently under development, which include the expansion and rebranding of Sands Cotai Central to The Londoner Macao, the Four Seasons Tower Suites Macao, the St. Regis Tower Suites Macao and our Las Vegas condominium project (for which construction currently is suspended) in the United States. 
Strengths and Strategies
We believe we have a number of strengths that differentiate our business from our competitors, including:
Diversified, high quality Integrated Resort offerings with substantial non-gaming amenities. Our Integrated Resorts feature non-gaming attractions and amenities including world-class entertainment, expansive retail offerings and market-leading meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions ("MICE") facilities. These attractions and amenities enhance the appeal of our Integrated Resorts, contributing to visitation, length of stay and customer expenditure at our resorts. The broad appeal of our market-leading Integrated Resort offerings in our various markets enables us to serve the widest array of customer segments in each market.
Substantial and diversified cash flow from existing operations. We generated $4.70 billion of cash from operations during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily from gaming and non-gaming sources, including retail, hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and MICE business.
Market leadership in the growing high-margin mass market gaming segment. We focus on the high-margin mass gaming segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had the highest percentage of gaming win from mass tables and slots of the Macao operators, with approximately 30% market share. Management estimates our mass market table revenues typically generate a gross margin that is approximately four times higher than the gross margin 
4

on our typical VIP table revenues in Macao. During the year ended December 31, 2018, non-rolling gross gaming revenue contributed to over two-thirds of total gross gaming revenue at Marina Bay Sands.
Established brands with broad regional and international market awareness and appeal. Our brands enjoy broad regional and international market awareness and appeal. The Venetian Macao is the most visited Integrated Resort in Macao, and enjoys broad brand awareness both regionally and globally. We estimate that since 2016 The Parisian Macao digital marketing and social media program has reached over 4 billion online impressions, including from platforms within China such as Sina Weibo. Additionally, Marina Bay Sands has become an iconic part of the Singapore skyline and is often featured in movies and other media.
Experienced management team with a proven track record. Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson is our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Adelson’s business career spans more than seven decades and has included creating and developing to maturity numerous companies. Mr. Adelson created the MICE-based Integrated Resort and pioneered its development in the Las Vegas and Singapore markets, as well as in Macao, where he planned and developed the Cotai Strip. Mr. Robert G. Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer, has been an integral part of the Company's executive team from the very outset - even before The Venetian Resort Las Vegas was a concept. Mr. Goldstein is one of the most respected and knowledgeable hospitality and gaming executives in the industry today, and provides strategic direction to our properties. Mr. Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been with the Company for more than eight years and has prior experience in corporate finance and management. He and the management team are focused on increasing our balance sheet strength, preserving the Company’s financial flexibility to pursue development opportunities and continuing to execute our return of excess capital to shareholders.
Unique MICE and entertainment facilities. Our market-leading MICE and entertainment facilities contribute to our markets’ diversification and appeal to business and leisure travelers while diversifying our cash flows and increasing revenues and profit. Our 5.2 million square feet of global MICE space is specifically designed to meet the needs of meeting planners and corporate events and trade show organizers from around the world. Our experience and expertise in this industry continues to drive leisure and business tourism to our markets. The live entertainment program at our properties, specifically in Asia, is a key traffic driver and has established us as the leader in the field of tourism and leisure activities.
Building on our key strengths, we seek to enhance our position as the leading developer and operator of Integrated Resorts and casinos by continuing to implement the following business strategies:
Developing and diversifying our Integrated Resort offerings to include a full complement of products and services to cater to different market segments. Our Integrated Resorts include MICE space, additional retail, dining and entertainment facilities and a range of hotel offerings to cater to different segments of our markets, including branded suites and hotel rooms. We are able to leverage the recognition and the sales, marketing and reservation capabilities of premier hotel brands to attract a wide range of customers in different market segments to our properties. We believe our partnerships with renowned hotel management partners, our diverse Integrated Resort offerings and the convenience and accessibility of our properties will continue to increase the appeal of our properties to both the business and leisure customer segments.
Leveraging our scale of operations to create and maintain an absolute cost advantage. Management expects to benefit from lower unit costs due to the economies of scale inherent in our operations. Opportunities for lower unit costs include, but are not limited to, lower utility costs; more efficient staffing of hotel and gaming operations; and centralized laundry, transportation, marketing and sales, and procurement. In addition, our scale allows us to consolidate certain administrative functions and leverage purchasing on a global scale.
Focusing on the high-margin mass market gaming segment, while continuing to provide luxury amenities and high service levels to our VIP and premium players. Our properties cater not only to VIP and premium players, but also to mass market customers, which comprise our most profitable gaming segment. We believe the mass market segment will continue to be a long-term growing segment as a result of the introduction of more high-quality gaming facilities and non-gaming amenities into our markets.
Identifying targeted investment opportunities to drive growth across our portfolio. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of our facilities and the enhancement of the leisure and business tourism appeal of our property portfolio.

Asia Operations
Macao
The Venetian Macao is the anchor property of our Cotai Strip development and is conveniently located approximately two miles from the Taipa Ferry Terminal on Macao's Taipa Island and six miles from the bridge linking Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai. The Venetian Macao includes approximately 374,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 710 table games and 1,540 slot machines. The Venetian Macao features a 39-floor luxury hotel tower with over 2,900 elegantly appointed luxury suites and the Shoppes at Venetian, approximately 943,000 square feet of unique retail shopping with more than 350 stores featuring many international brands and home to more than 50 restaurants and food outlets featuring an international assortment of cuisines. In addition, The Venetian Macao has approximately 1.2 million square feet of convention facilities and meeting room space, an 1,800-seat theater, the 15,000-seat CotaiArena that hosts world-class entertainment and sporting events and a Paiza Club.
Sands Cotai Central, which features four hotel towers, is located across the street from The Venetian Macao, The Parisian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, and is our largest Integrated Resort on the Cotai Strip. Sands Cotai Central opened in phases, beginning in April 2012. The property features four hotel towers: the first hotel tower, which opened in April 2012, consisting of approximately 650 five-star rooms and suites under the Conrad brand and approximately 1,200 four-star rooms and suites under the Holiday Inn brand; the second hotel tower, which opened in September 2012, consisting of approximately 1,800 rooms and suites under the Sheraton brand; the third hotel tower, which opened in January 2013, consisting of approximately 2,100 rooms and suites under the Sheraton brand; and the fourth hotel tower, which opened in December 2015, consisting of approximately 400 rooms and suites under the St. Regis brand. The Integrated Resort includes approximately 367,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 430 table games and 1,410 slot machines, approximately 369,000 square feet of meeting space, a 1,701-seat theater, approximately 520,000 square feet of retail space with more than 150 stores and home to more than 50 restaurants and food outlets. We previously announced the renovation, expansion and rebranding of Sands Cotai Central into a new destination Integrated Resort, The Londoner Macao, by adding extensive thematic elements both externally and internally. The Londoner Macao will feature new attractions and features from London, including some of London’s most recognizable landmarks, and expanded retail and food and beverage venues. We will add approximately 370 luxury suites in the St. Regis Tower Suites Macao. Design work is nearing completion and construction is being initiated and will be phased to minimize disruption during the property’s peak periods. We expect the additional St. Regis Tower Suites Macao to be completed in 2020 and The Londoner Macao project to be completed in phases throughout 2020 and 2021. 
On September 13, 2016, we opened The Parisian Macao, our newest Integrated Resort on the Cotai Strip, which is connected to The Venetian Macao and The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, and includes approximately 253,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 340 table games and 1,100 slot machines. The Parisian Macao also features approximately 2,500 rooms and suites and the Shoppes at Parisian, approximately 296,000 square feet of unique retail shopping with more than 150 stores featuring many international brands and home to 23 restaurants and food outlets featuring an international assortment of cuisines. Other non-gaming amenities at The Parisian Macao include a meeting room complex of approximately 63,000 square feet and a 1,200-seat theater. Directly in front of The Parisian Macao, and connected via a covered walkway to the main building, is a half-scale authentic re-creation of the Eiffel Tower containing a viewing platform and restaurant. 
The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, which is located adjacent to The Venetian Macao, has approximately 105,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 120 table games and 160 slot machines at its Plaza Casino. The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao also has 360 elegantly appointed rooms and suites managed by Four Seasons Hotels, Inc., several food and beverage offerings, and conference and banquet facilities. The Shoppes at Four Seasons includes approximately 242,000 square feet of retail space and is connected to the Shoppes at Venetian. The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao also features 19 ultra-exclusive Paiza Mansions, which are individually designed and made available by invitation only. We previously announced the Four Seasons Tower Suites Macao, which will feature approximately 290 additional premium quality suites. We have completed the structural work of the tower and have commenced preliminary build out of the suites. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. 
The Sands Macao, the first U.S. operated Las Vegas-style casino in Macao, is situated near the Macao-Hong Kong Ferry Terminal on a waterfront parcel centrally located between Macao's Gongbei border gate with China and Macao's 
6

central business district. The Sands Macao includes approximately 213,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 220 table games and 870 slot machines. The Sands Macao also includes a 289-suite hotel tower, spa facilities, several restaurants and entertainment areas, and a Paiza Club.
We operate the gaming areas within our Macao properties pursuant to a 20-year gaming subconcession that expires in June 2022. See "Regulation and Licensing — Macao Concession and Our Subconcession."
Singapore
Marina Bay Sands features approximately 2,600 rooms and suites located in three 55-story hotel towers. Atop the three towers is the Sands SkyPark, an extensive outdoor recreation area with a 150-meter infinity swimming pool and leading restaurant and nightlife brands. The Integrated Resort offers approximately 160,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 625 table games and 2,360 slot machines; The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, an enclosed retail, dining and entertainment complex with signature restaurants from world-renowned chefs; an event plaza and promenade; and an art/science museum. Marina Bay Sands also includes approximately 1.2 million square feet of meeting and convention space and a state-of-the-art theater for top Broadway shows, concerts and gala events.
We operate the gaming area within our Singapore property pursuant to a 30-year casino concession provided under a development agreement entered into in August 2006. See "Regulation and Licensing — Development Agreement with Singapore Tourism Board."
Asia Markets
Macao
Macao is the largest gaming market in the world and the only market in China to offer legalized casino gaming. According to Macao government statistics issued publicly on a monthly basis by the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (commonly referred to as the "DICJ"), annual gaming revenues were $37.7 billion in 2018, a 13.4% increase compared to 2017.
We expect Macao will continue to experience meaningful long-term growth and the approximately 36 million visitors Macao welcomed in 2018 will continue to increase over time. We believe this growth will be driven by a variety of factors, including the movement of Chinese citizens to urban centers in China, continued growth of the Chinese outbound tourism market, the increased utilization of existing transportation infrastructure, the introduction of new transportation infrastructure and the continued increase in hotel room inventory in Macao and neighboring Hengqin Island. There has been significant investment announced and recently completed by concessionaires and subconcessionaires in new resort development projects on Cotai. These new resorts should help increase the critical mass on Cotai and further drive Macao's transformation into a leading business and leisure tourism hub in Asia.
Table games are the dominant form of gaming in Asia, with Baccarat being the most popular game. We continue to experience Macao market-leading visitation and are focused on driving high-margin mass market gaming, while providing luxury amenities and high service levels to our VIP and premium players. We intend to continue to introduce more modern and popular products that appeal to the Asian marketplace and believe our high-quality gaming product has enabled us to capture a meaningful share of the overall Macao gaming market across all types of players.
Proximity to Major Asian Cities
Visitors from Hong Kong, southeast China, Taiwan and other locations in Asia can reach Macao in a relatively short time, using a variety of transportation methods, and visitors from more distant locations in Asia can take advantage of short travel times by air to Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou or Hong Kong (followed by a road, ferry or helicopter trip to Macao). In addition, numerous air carriers fly directly into Macao International Airport from many major cities in Asia.
Macao draws a significant number of customers who are visitors or residents of Hong Kong. One of the major methods of transportation to Macao from Hong Kong is the jetfoil ferry service, including our ferry service, CotaiJet. Macao is also accessible from Hong Kong by helicopter. In addition, the bridge linking Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai, which opened in 2018, has reduced the travel time between Hong Kong and Macao and the travel time from the Hong Kong International Airport to Macao.

Competition in Macao
Gaming in Macao is administered by the government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires, of which we are one. No additional concessions have been granted by the Macao government since 2002; however, if the Macao government were to allow additional gaming operators in Macao through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition.
Sociedade de Jogos de Macau S.A. ("SJM") holds one of the three concessions and currently operates 20 facilities throughout Macao. Historically, SJM was the only gaming operator in Macao. Many of its gaming facilities are relatively small locations that are offered as amenities in hotels; however, some are large operations, including the Hotel Lisboa and The Grand Lisboa. In February 2014, SJM announced the development of Grand Lisboa Palace, a 2,000-room resort on Cotai that is scheduled to open in the second half of 2019.
MGM Grand Paradise Limited, a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Pansy Ho Chiu-King, obtained a subconcession from SJM in April 2005 (which subconcession expires in March 2020), allowing the joint venture to conduct gaming operations in Macao. The MGM Grand Macau opened in December 2007 and is located on the Macao Peninsula adjacent to the Wynn Macau. In February 2018, MGM Grand Paradise Limited opened MGM Cotai, which includes approximately 1,400 hotel rooms and other non-gaming amenities, and is located behind Sands Cotai Central.
Wynn Resorts (Macau), S.A. ("Wynn Resorts Macau"), a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts Limited, holds a concession and owns and operates the Wynn Macau and Encore at Wynn Macau. In August 2016, Wynn Resorts Macau opened a 1,700-room integrated resort, Wynn Palace, which is located behind the City of Dreams and MGM Cotai.
In 2006, an affiliate of Publishing and Broadcasting Limited ("PBL") purchased the subconcession right under Wynn Resorts Macau's gaming concession, which permitted the PBL affiliate to receive a gaming subconcession from the Macao government. The PBL affiliate, Melco Crown Entertainment Limited ("Melco Crown"), owns and operates Altira and the City of Dreams, an integrated casino resort located adjacent to our Sands Cotai Central, which includes Nuwa, The Countdown Hotel and Grand Hyatt hotels. In October 2015, Melco Crown and its joint venture partners opened Studio City, a 1,600-room casino resort on Cotai. Melco Crown opened its fifth tower at City of Dreams, the 772-room Morpheus Tower, in June 2018.
Galaxy Casino Company Limited ("Galaxy") holds the third concession and has the ability to operate casino properties independent of our subconcession agreement with Galaxy and the Macao government. Galaxy currently operates six casinos in Macao, including StarWorld Hotel and Galaxy Macau, which is located near The Venetian Macao. In May 2015, Galaxy opened the second phase of its Galaxy Macau, which includes approximately 1,250 hotel rooms, as well as additional retail and convention and exhibition facilities.
Our Macao operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations, both in Asia and globally.
Singapore
Singapore is regarded as having the most developed financial and transportation infrastructure in the Southeast Asia region. Singapore has established itself as a destination for both business and leisure visitors, offering convention and exhibition facilities as well as world-class shopping malls and hotel accommodations. In 2006, after a competitive bid process, the Singapore government awarded two concessions to develop and operate two integrated resorts. We were awarded the concession for the Marina Bay site, which is adjacent to Singapore's central business district, and Genting International was awarded the second site, located on Singapore's Sentosa Island.
Based on figures released by the Singapore Tourism Board (the "STB"), Singapore welcomed over 18 million international visitors in 2018, a 6.2% increase compared to 2017. Tourism receipts are estimated to have reached 26.8 billion Singapore dollars ("SGD," approximately $19.6 billion at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018) in 2017 (the latest information publicly available at the time of filing), a 4.3% increase compared to 2016. The Casino Regulatory Authority (the "CRA"), the gaming regulator in Singapore, does not disclose gaming revenue for the market and thus no official figure exists.
We believe Marina Bay Sands is ideally positioned within Singapore to cater to both business and leisure visitors. The Integrated Resort is centrally located within a 20-minute drive from Singapore's Changi International Airport and near the Marina Bay Cruise Center, a deep-water cruise ship terminal, and Bayfront station, a mass rapid transit station. 
8

Marina Bay Sands is also located near several entertainment attractions, including the Gardens by the Bay botanical gardens and the Singapore Sports Hub, a sports complex featuring the 55,000-seat National Stadium.
Baccarat is the preferred table game in both VIP and mass gaming. Additionally, contributions from slot machines and from mass gaming, including electronic table games offerings, have enhanced the early growth of the market. As Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore market as a whole continue to mature, we expect to broaden our visitor base to continue to capture visitors from around the world.
Proximity to Major Asian Cities
About 100 airlines operate in Singapore, connecting it to some 400 cities in about 100 countries. In 2018, 66 million passengers passed through Singapore's Changi Airport, a 5.5% decrease as compared to 2017. Based on figures released by the STB, the largest source markets for visitors to Singapore for 2018 were China and Indonesia. The STB's methodology for reporting visitor arrivals does not recognize Malaysian citizens entering Singapore by land, although this method of visitation is generally thought to be substantial.
Competition in Singapore
Gaming in Singapore is administered by the government through the award of licenses to two operators, of which we are one. Pursuant to the request for proposals to develop an integrated resort at Marina Bay, Singapore (the "Request for Proposal"), the CRA was required to ensure there would not be more than two casino licenses during an initial ten-year exclusive period (the "Exclusivity Period"), which expired on February 28, 2017.
Resorts World Sentosa, which is 100% owned by Genting Singapore and located on Sentosa Island, is primarily a family tourist destination connected to Singapore via a 500-meter long vehicular and pedestrian bridge. Apart from the casino, the resort includes six hotels, a Universal Studios theme park, the Marine Life Park, the Maritime Experiential Museum, aquarium, conventions and exhibitions facilities, restaurants, as well as a Malaysian food street, and retail shops. 
Our Singapore operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations, both in Asia and globally.
U.S. Operations
Las Vegas
Our Las Vegas Operating Properties is an Integrated Resort that includes The Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo Center.
The Venetian Resort Las Vegas features three hotel towers. The Venetian Tower is a 35-story three-winged luxury hotel tower with 3,015 suites rising above the casino. The second tower is an adjoining 1,013-suite, 12-story Venezia Tower. The Palazzo Tower has 3,064 suites situated in a 50-story luxury hotel tower, which features modern European ambience and design, and is directly connected to The Venetian Tower and Sands Expo Center. The Venetian Resort Las Vegas has approximately 225,000 square feet of gaming space and includes approximately 240 table games and 1,870 slot machines. The Venetian Resort Las Vegas features a variety of amenities for its guests, including Paiza Club, several theaters and Canyon Ranch SpaClub.
The Venetian Resort Las Vegas features an enclosed retail, dining and entertainment complex, referred to as the Grand Canal Shoppes. The portion of the complex located within The Venetian Tower (previously known as "The Grand Canal Shoppes") and the portion located within The Palazzo Tower (previously known as "The Shoppes at The Palazzo") were sold to GGP Limited Partnership ("GGP") in 2004 and 2008, respectively.
Sands Expo Center is one of the largest overall trade show and convention facilities in the United States (as measured by net leasable square footage), with approximately 1.2 million gross square feet of exhibit and meeting space. We also own an approximately 1.1 million-gross-square-foot meeting and conference facility that links Sands Expo Center to The Venetian Resort Las Vegas. Together, we offer approximately 2.3 million gross square feet of state-of-the-art exhibition and meeting facilities that can be configured to provide small, mid-size or large meeting rooms and/or accommodate large-scale multi-media events or trade shows.
In May 2016, we announced plans to work with Madison Square Garden Company to bring a 400,000-square-foot venue built specifically for music and entertainment to Las Vegas. In February 2018, Madison Square Garden 
9

unveiled its plans for MSG Sphere at The Venetian, an 18,000-seat venue, which, subject to regulatory approvals and entitlements, will be located near, and connected directly to, our Las Vegas Operating Properties and is currently expected to open in 2021.
Pennsylvania
We own and operate the Sands Bethlehem, a gaming, hotel, retail and dining complex located on the site of the historic Bethlehem Steel Works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Sands Bethlehem features approximately 146,000 square feet of gaming space that includes approximately 190 table games and 3,260 slot machines; a hotel tower with 282 rooms; a 150,000-square-foot retail facility ("The Outlets at Sands Bethlehem"); an arts and cultural center; and a 50,000-square-foot multipurpose event center.
We own 86% of the economic interest in the gaming, hotel and entertainment portion of Sands Bethlehem through our ownership interest in Sands Bethworks Gaming LLC ("Sands Bethworks Gaming") and approximately 35% of the economic interest in the retail portion of Sands Bethlehem through our ownership interest in Sands Bethworks Retail LLC ("Sands Bethworks Retail").
On March 8, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement under which PCI Gaming Authority, an unincorporated, chartered instrumentality of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, will acquire Sands Bethlehem for a total enterprise value of $1.30 billion. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory review and other closing conditions.
Las Vegas Market
The Las Vegas hotel/casino industry is highly competitive. Hotels on the Las Vegas Strip compete with other hotels on and off the Las Vegas Strip, including hotels in downtown Las Vegas. In addition, there are large projects in Las Vegas in the development stage or currently suspended and, if opened, may target the same customers as we do. Based on figures released by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (the "LVCVA"), Las Vegas welcomed 42 million visitors during 2018, relatively flat compared to 2017.
We also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands, including those located in California. While the competitive impact on our operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same region as our Las Vegas Operating Properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our Las Vegas Operating Properties also compete, to some extent, with other hotel/casino facilities in Nevada, with hotel/casino and other resort facilities elsewhere in the country and the world, and with Internet gaming and state lotteries.
In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas. The continued proliferation of gaming venues could have a significant and adverse effect on our business. In particular, the legalization of casino gaming in or near major metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. The current global trend toward liberalization of gaming restrictions and the resulting proliferation of gaming venues could result in a decrease in the number of visitors to our Las Vegas Operating Properties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, on December 23, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") released an opinion that concluded the Wire Act only related to interstate transmission of wire communications regarding wagers on sporting events or information assisting in the placing of wagers on sporting events (the "2011 Opinion"). In concluding as such, the DOJ reversed earlier opinions that the Wire Act was not limited to only sporting events or contests. On January 14, 2019, the DOJ released a Slip Opinion dated November 2, 2018 that reversed the 2011 Opinion.
Las Vegas generally competes with trade show and convention facilities located in and around major U.S. cities. Within Las Vegas, the Sands Expo Center competes with the Las Vegas Convention Center (the "LVCC"), which currently has approximately 3.2 million gross square feet of convention and exhibit facilities. In addition to the LVCC, some of our Las Vegas competitors have convention and conference facilities that compete with our Las Vegas Operating Properties. Based on figures released by the LVCVA, nearly 7 million convention delegates visited Las Vegas during 2018, a 2.2% decrease compared to 2017.
Competitors of our Las Vegas Operating Properties that can offer a hotel/casino experience that is integrated with substantial trade show and convention, conference and meeting facilities, could have an adverse effect on our competitive 
10

advantage in attracting trade show and convention, conference and meeting attendees. Major competitors in Las Vegas continue to implement and evaluate opportunities to expand casino, hotel and convention offerings.
Retail Mall Operations
We own and operate retail malls at our Integrated Resorts at The Venetian Macao, Sands Cotai Central, The Parisian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Sands Macao, Marina Bay Sands and Sands Bethlehem. Upon completion of all phases of Sands Cotai Central's renovation, rebranding and expansion to The Londoner Macao, we will own approximately 3.0 million square feet of gross retail space. As further described in "Agreements Relating to the Malls in Las Vegas" below, the Grand Canal Shoppes were sold to GGP and are not owned or operated by us. Management believes being in the retail mall business and, specifically, owning some of the largest retail properties in Asia will provide meaningful value for us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow.
Our malls are designed to complement our other unique amenities and service offerings provided by our Integrated Resorts. Our strategy is to seek out desirable tenants that appeal to our customers and provide a wide variety of shopping options. We generate our mall revenue primarily from leases with tenants through base minimum rents, overage rents and reimbursements for common area maintenance ("CAM") and other expenditures. For further information related to the financial performance of our malls, see "Part II — Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
The tables below set forth certain information regarding our mall operations on the Cotai Strip and at Marina Bay Sands as of December 31, 2018. These tables do not reflect subsequent activity in 2019.

Advertising and Marketing
We advertise in many types of media, including television, Internet (including search engines, e-mail, online advertising and social media), radio, newspapers, magazines and other out-of-home advertising (including billboards), to promote general market awareness of our properties as unique leisure, business and convention destinations due to our first-class hotels, casinos, retail stores, restaurants and other amenities. We actively engage in direct marketing as allowed in various geographic regions. 
We maintain websites to allow our customers to make room and/or restaurant reservations, purchase show tickets and provide feedback. We also continue to enhance and expand our use of digital marketing and social media to promote our Integrated Resorts, events and special offers, cultivate customer relationships and provide information and updates regarding our corporate citizenship efforts, including our sustainability and corporate giving programs.
Development Projects
We are constantly evaluating opportunities to improve our product offerings, such as refreshing our meeting and convention facilities, suites and rooms, retail malls, restaurant and nightlife mix and our gaming areas, as well as other revenue generating additions to our Integrated Resorts. 
Macao
We previously announced the renovation, expansion and rebranding of the Sands Cotai Central into a new destination Integrated Resort, The Londoner Macao, by adding extensive thematic elements both externally and internally. The Londoner Macao will feature new attractions and features from London, including some of London’s most recognizable landmarks, and expanded retail and food and beverage venues. We will add approximately 370 luxury suites in the St. Regis Tower Suites Macao. Design work is nearing completion and construction is being initiated and will be phased to minimize disruption during the property’s peak periods. We expect the additional St. Regis Tower Suites Macao to be completed in 2020 and The Londoner Macao project to be completed in phases throughout 2020 and 2021.
12

We also previously announced the Four Seasons Tower Suites Macao, which will feature approximately 290 additional premium quality suites. We have completed the structural work of the tower and have commenced preliminary build out of the suites. We expect the project to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.
We anticipate the total costs associated with these development projects to be approximately $2.2 billion. The ultimate costs and completion dates for these projects are subject to change as we finalize our planning and design work and complete the projects. See "Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors — There are significant risks associated with our construction projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows."
United States
We began constructing a high-rise residential condominium tower (the "Las Vegas Condo Tower"), located on the Las Vegas Strip within The Venetian Resort Las Vegas. In 2008, we suspended construction activities for the project due to reduced demand for Las Vegas Strip condominiums and the overall decline in general economic conditions. We continue to evaluate the highest return opportunity for the project. The impact of the suspension on the estimated overall cost of the project is currently not determinable with certainty. Should management decide to abandon the project, we could record a charge for some portion of the $129 million in capitalized construction costs (net of depreciation) as of December 31, 2018.
Other
We continue to evaluate additional development projects in each of our markets and pursue new development opportunities globally. 
Regulation and Licensing
Macao Concession and Our Subconcession
In June 2002, the Macao government granted one of three concessions to operate casinos in Macao to Galaxy. During December 2002, we entered into a subconcession agreement with Galaxy, which was approved by the Macao government. The subconcession agreement allows us to develop and operate certain casino projects in Macao, including Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao, separately from Galaxy. Under the subconcession agreement, we are obligated to operate casino games of chance or games of other forms in Macao. We were also obligated to develop and open The Venetian Macao and a convention center by December 2007, and we were required to invest, or cause to be invested, at least 4.4 billion patacas (approximately $548 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) in various development projects in Macao by June 2009, which obligations we have fulfilled.
If the Galaxy concession is terminated for any reason, our subconcession will remain in effect. The subconcession may be terminated by agreement between Galaxy and us. Galaxy is not entitled to terminate the subconcession unilaterally; however, the Macao government, after consultation with Galaxy, may terminate the subconcession under certain circumstances. Galaxy has developed, and may continue to develop, hotel and casino projects separately from us.
According to the Macao gaming regulatory framework, 10.0% of each subconcessionaire’s issued share capital must be held by its managing director, who must be appointed by the applicable subconcessionaire and must be a permanent Macao resident. Mr. Antonio Ferreira is the appointed managing director of Venetian Macau Limited ("VML") and a permanent Macao resident. Mr. Ferreira holds 10.0% of VML’s issued share capital subject to a usufruct agreement entered into with Venetian Venture Development Intermediate Limited ("VVDIL"), the immediate parent company of VML and a wholly owned subsidiary of SCL. The usufruct provides that VVDIL has the sole and exclusive benefit of the 10.0% of VML's issued share capital held by Mr. Ferreira. Mr. Ferreira has no economic interest in VML and receives no distributions.
We are subject to licensing and control under applicable Macao law and are required to be licensed by the Macao gaming authorities to operate a casino. We must pay periodic and regular fees and taxes, and our gaming license is not transferable. We must periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Macao gaming authorities and furnish any other information the Macao gaming authorities may require. No person may acquire any rights over the shares or assets of VML, SCL's wholly owned subsidiary, without first obtaining the approval of the Macao gaming 
13

authorities. Similarly, no person may enter into possession of its premises or operate them through a management agreement or any other contract or through step in rights without first obtaining the approval of, and receiving a license from, the Macao gaming authorities. The transfer or creation of encumbrances over ownership of shares representing the share capital of VML or other rights relating to such shares, and any act involving the granting of voting rights or other stockholders' rights to persons other than the original owners, would require the approval of the Macao government and the subsequent report of such acts and transactions to the Macao gaming authorities.
Our subconcession agreement requires, among other things: (i) approval of the Macao government for transfers of shares in VML, or of any rights over or inherent to such shares, including the grant of voting rights or other stockholder's rights to persons other than the original owners, as well as for the creation of any charge, lien or encumbrance on such shares; (ii) approval of the Macao government for transfers of shares, or of any rights over such shares, in any of our direct or indirect stockholders, provided that such shares or rights are directly or indirectly equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of VML's share capital; and (iii) that the Macao government be given notice of the creation of any encumbrance or the grant of voting rights or other stockholder's rights to persons other than the original owners on shares in any of the direct or indirect stockholders in VML, provided that such shares or rights are equivalent to an amount that is equal to or higher than 5% of VML's share capital. The requirements in provisions (ii) and (iii) above will not apply, however, to securities listed as tradable on a stock exchange.
The Macao gaming authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, us to determine whether our suitability and/or financial capacity is affected by this individual. LVSC and SCL shareholders with 5% or more of the share capital, directors and some of our key employees must apply for and undergo a finding of suitability process and maintain due qualification during the subconcession term, and accept the persistent and long-term inspection and supervision exercised by the Macao government. VML is required to notify the Macao government immediately should VML become aware of any fact that may be material to the appropriate qualification of any shareholder who owns 5% of the share capital, or any officer, director or key employee. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Macao gaming authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Macao gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in corporate position. If the Macao gaming authorities were to find one of our officers, directors or key employees unsuitable for licensing, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. In addition, the Macao gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability after being ordered to do so by the Macao gaming authorities may be found unsuitable. Any stockholder found unsuitable who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a company incorporated in Macao and registered with the Macao Companies and Moveable Assets Registrar (a "Macao registered corporation") beyond the period of time prescribed by the Macao gaming authorities may lose their rights to the shares. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us, we:

• | pay that person any dividend or interest upon its shares;


• | allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through shares held by that person;


• | pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or


• | fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require that unsuitable person to relinquish its shares.

The Macao gaming authorities also have the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation holding a gaming license.
In addition, the Macao gaming authorities require prior approval for the creation of liens and encumbrances over VML's assets and restrictions on stock in connection with any financing.
The Macao gaming authorities must give their prior approval to changes in control of VML through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisition, management or consulting agreement or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Macao registered corporation must satisfy the Macao gaming authorities concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. The Macao gaming authorities may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship 
14

or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the transaction.
The Macao gaming authorities may consider some management opposition to corporate acquisitions, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Macao gaming licensees, and the Macao registered corporations affiliated with such operations, to be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming.
The Macao gaming authorities also have the power to supervise gaming licensees in order to:

• | assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;


• | preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and


• | promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

The subconcession agreement requires the Macao gaming authorities' prior approval of any recapitalization plan proposed by VML's Board of Directors. The Chief Executive of Macao could also require VML to increase its share capital if he deemed it necessary.
The Macao government also has the right, after consultation with Galaxy, to unilaterally terminate the subconcession agreement at any time upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including:

• | the operation of gaming without permission or operation of business that does not fall within the business scope of the subconcession;


• | the suspension of operations of our gaming business in Macao without reasonable grounds for more than seven consecutive days or more than fourteen non-consecutive days within one calendar year;


• | the unauthorized transfer of all or part of our gaming operations in Macao;


• | the failure to pay taxes, premiums, levies or other amounts payable to the Macao government;


• | the failure to resume operations following the temporary assumption of operations by the Macao government;


• | the repeated opposition to supervision and inspection or the repeated failure to comply with decisions of the Macao government, namely of the Macao gaming authorities;


• | the failure to provide or supplement the guarantee deposit or the guarantees specified in the subconcession within the prescribed period;


• | the bankruptcy or insolvency of VML;


• | fraudulent activity by VML;


• | serious and repeated violation by VML of the applicable rules for carrying out casino games of chance or games of other forms or the operation of casino games of chance or games of other forms;


• | the grant to any other person of any managing power over VML; or


• | the failure by a controlling shareholder in VML to dispose of its interest in VML following notice from the gaming authorities of another jurisdiction in which such controlling shareholder is licensed to operate casino games of chance to the effect that such controlling shareholder can no longer own shares in VML.

In addition, we must comply with various covenants and other provisions under the subconcession, including obligations to:

• | ensure the proper operation and conduct of casino games;


• | employ people with appropriate qualifications;


• | operate and conduct casino games of chance in a fair and honest manner without the influence of criminal activities;


• | safeguard and ensure Macao's interests in tax revenue from the operation of casinos and other gaming areas; and

15


• | maintain a specified level of insurance.

The subconcession agreement also allows the Macao government to request various changes in the plans and specifications of our Macao properties and to make various other decisions and determinations that may be binding on us. For example, the Macao government has the right to require that we contribute additional capital to our Macao subsidiaries or that we provide certain deposits or other guarantees of performance in any amount determined by the Macao government to be necessary. VML is limited in its ability to raise additional capital by the need to first obtain the approval of the Macao gaming and governmental authorities before raising certain debt or equity.
If our subconcession is terminated in the event of a default, the casinos and gaming-related equipment would be automatically transferred to the Macao government without compensation to us and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. In many of these instances, the subconcession agreement does not provide a specific cure period within which any such events may be cured and, instead, we would rely on consultations and negotiations with the Macao government to give us an opportunity to remedy any such default.
The Sands Macao, The Venetian Macao, The Plaza Macao and Four Seasons Hotel Macao, Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao are being operated under our subconcession agreement. This subconcession excludes the following gaming activities: mutual bets, lotteries, raffles, interactive gaming and games of chance or other gaming, betting or gambling activities on ships or planes. Our subconcession is exclusively governed by Macao law. We are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Macao in case of any dispute or conflict relating to our subconcession.
Our subconcession agreement expires on June 26, 2022. Unless our subconcession is extended, on that date, the casinos and gaming-related equipment will automatically be transferred to the Macao government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. Beginning on December 26, 2017, the Macao government may redeem our subconcession by giving us at least one-year prior notice and by paying us fair compensation or indemnity.
Under our subconcession, we are obligated to pay to the Macao government an annual premium with a fixed portion and a variable portion based on the number and type of gaming tables employed and gaming machines operated by us. The fixed portion of the premium is equal to 30 million patacas (approximately $4 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018). The variable portion is equal to 300,000 patacas per gaming table reserved exclusively for certain kinds of games or players, 150,000 patacas per gaming table not so reserved and 1,000 patacas per electrical or mechanical gaming machine, including slot machines (approximately $37,195, $18,598 and $124, respectively, at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018), subject to a minimum of 45 million patacas (approximately $6 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018). We also have to pay a special gaming tax of 35% of gross gaming revenues and applicable withholding taxes. We must also contribute 4% of our gross gaming revenue to utilities designated by the Macao government, a portion of which must be used for promotion of tourism in Macao. This percentage may be subject to change in the future.
Currently, the gaming tax in Macao is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue; however, unlike Nevada, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions for credit losses. As a result, if we extend credit to our customers in Macao and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we have to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers even though we were unable to collect on the related receivables. If the laws are not changed, our business in Macao may not be able to realize the full benefits of extending credit to our customers.
In August 2018, we received an additional exemption from Macao's corporate income tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games of chance for the period of January 1, 2019 through June 26, 2022, the date our subconcession agreement expires. We entered into an agreement with the Macao government effective through the end of 2018 that provided for an annual payment of 42 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018) as a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions. In September 2018, we requested an additional agreement with the Macao government through June 26, 2022, to correspond to the expiration of the income tax exemption for gaming operations; however, there is no assurance we will receive the additional agreement.
Development Agreement with Singapore Tourism Board
On August 23, 2006, our wholly owned subsidiary, Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. ("MBS"), entered into a development agreement, as amended by a supplementary agreement on December 11, 2009 (the "Development 
16

Agreement"), with the STB to design, develop, construct and operate the Marina Bay Sands. The Development Agreement includes a concession for MBS to own and operate a casino within the Integrated Resort. In addition to the casino, the Integrated Resort includes, among other amenities, a hotel, a retail complex, a convention center and meeting room complex, theaters, restaurants and an art/science museum. MBS is one of two companies awarded a concession to operate a casino in Singapore. Under the Request for Proposal, the Exclusivity Period provides that only two licensees will be granted the right to operate a casino in Singapore during an initial ten-year period, which expired on February 28, 2017. In connection with entering into the Development Agreement, MBS entered into a 60-year lease with the STB for the parcels underlying the project site and entered into an agreement with the Land Transport Authority of Singapore for the provision of necessary infrastructure for rapid transit systems and road works within and/or outside the project site. During the Exclusivity Period, the Company, which is currently the 100% indirect shareholder of MBS, must continue to be the single largest entity with direct or indirect controlling interest of at least 20% in MBS, unless otherwise approved by the CRA.
The term of the casino concession provided under the Development Agreement is for 30 years commencing from the date the Development Agreement was entered into, or August 23, 2006. In order to renew the casino concession, MBS must give notice to the STB and other relevant authorities in Singapore at least five years before its expiration in August 2036. The Singapore government may terminate the casino concession prior to its expiration in order to serve the best interests of the public, in which event fair compensation will be paid to MBS.
On April 26, 2010, MBS was issued a casino license for a three-year period, which required payment of a license fee of SGD 38 million (approximately $27 million at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction). On April 19, 2013 and April 19, 2016, MBS was granted a license for a further three-year period expiring on April 25, 2016 and April 25, 2019, respectively, which required payment of SGD 57 million and SGD 66 million, respectively (approximately $46 million and $47 million, respectively, at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) as part of the renewal process. The license is renewable upon submitting a renewal application, paying the applicable fee and meeting the renewal requirements as determined by the CRA. We have filed a renewal application and believe we meet the renewal requirements as determined by the CRA; however, no assurance can be given the license renewal will be granted or for what period of time it will be granted.
The Development Agreement contains, among other things, restrictions limiting the use of the leased land to the development and operation of the project, requirements that MBS obtain prior approval from the STB in order to subdivide the hotel and retail components of the project, and prohibitions on any such subdivision during the Exclusivity Period. The Development Agreement also contains provisions relating to the construction of the project and associated deadlines for substantial completion and opening; the location of the casino within the project site and casino licensing issues; insurance requirements; and limitations on MBS' ability to assign the lease or sub-lease any portion of the land during the Exclusivity Period. In addition, the Development Agreement contains events of default, including, among other things, the failure of MBS to perform its obligations under the Development Agreement and events of bankruptcy or dissolution.
The Development Agreement required MBS to invest at least SGD 3.85 billion (approximately $2.42 billion at exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction) in the Integrated Resort, which was to be allocated in specified amounts among the casino, hotel, food and beverage outlets, retail areas, meeting, convention and exhibition facilities, key attractions, entertainment venues and public areas. This minimum investment requirement has been fulfilled.
Employees whose job duties relate to the operations of the casino are required to be licensed by the relevant authorities in Singapore. MBS also must comply with comprehensive internal control standards or regulations concerning advertising; branch office operations; the location, floor plans and layout of the casino; casino operations including casino-related financial transactions and patron disputes, issuance of credit and collection of debt, relationships with and permitted payments to gaming promoters; security and surveillance; casino access by Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans; compliance functions and the prevention of money laundering; periodic standard and other reports to the CRA; and those relating to social controls including the exclusion of certain persons from the casino.
There is a goods and services tax of 7% imposed on gross gaming revenue and a casino tax of 15% imposed on the gross gaming revenue from the casino after reduction for the amount of goods and services tax, except in the case of gaming by premium players, in which case a casino tax of 5% is imposed on the gross gaming revenue generated from such players after reduction for the amount of the goods and services tax. The casino tax rates will not be changed for a period of 15 years from March 1, 2007. The casino tax is deductible against the Singapore corporate taxable 
17

income of MBS. The provision for bad debts arising from the extension of credit granted to gaming patrons is not deductible against gross gaming revenue when calculating the casino tax, but is deductible for the purposes of calculating corporate income tax and the goods and services tax (subject to the prevailing law). MBS is permitted to extend casino credit to persons who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents, but is not permitted to extend casino credit to Singapore citizens or permanent residents except to premium players. 
The key constraint imposed on the casino under the Development Agreement is the total size of the gaming area, which must not be more than 15,000 square meters (approximately 161,000 square feet). The following are not counted towards the gaming area: back of house facilities, reception, restrooms, food and beverage areas, retail shops, stairs, escalators and lift lobbies leading to the gaming area, aesthetic and decorative displays, performance areas and major aisles. The casino located within Marina Bay Sands may not have more than 2,500 gaming machines, but there is no limit on the number of tables for casino games permitted in the casino.
On January 31, 2013, certain amendments to the Casino Control Act (the "Singapore Act") became effective. Among the changes introduced by these amendments is a revision of the maximum financial penalty that may be imposed on a casino operator by way of disciplinary action on a number of grounds, including contravention of a provision of the Singapore Act or a condition of the casino license. Under the amended provisions, a casino operator may be subject to a financial penalty, for each ground of disciplinary action, of a sum not exceeding 10% of the annual gross gaming revenue (as defined in the Singapore Act) of the casino operator for the financial year immediately preceding the date the financial penalty is imposed.
The amendments to the Singapore Act also included an introduction of an additional factor to be considered by the CRA in determining future applications and/or renewals for a casino license. Applicants are required to be a suitable person to develop, maintain and promote the Integrated Resort as a compelling tourist destination that meets prevailing market demand and industry standards and contributes to the tourism industry in Singapore. The Singapore government has established an evaluation panel that will assess applicants and report to the CRA on this aspect of the casino licensing requirements. We believe MBS' iconic tourist destination in Singapore and the Far East is well-established at this time.
State of Nevada
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Nevada Act") and various local regulations. Our gaming operations are also subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission (the "Nevada Commission"), the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the "Nevada Board") and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board (the "CCLGLB" and together with the Nevada Commission and the Nevada Board, the "Nevada Gaming Authorities").
The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things:

• | the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;


• | the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record-keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities;


• | the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and


• | the establishment of a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees.

Any change in such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on our Las Vegas operations.
Las Vegas Sands, LLC ("LVSLLC") is licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities to operate the resort hotel as set forth in the Nevada Act. The gaming license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. LVSLLC is also registered as an intermediary company of Venetian Casino Resort, LLC ("VCR"). VCR is licensed as a manufacturer and distributor of gaming devices and as a key employee of LVSLLC. LVSLLC and VCR are collectively referred to as the "licensed subsidiaries." LVSC is registered with the Nevada Commission as a publicly traded 
18

corporation (the "registered corporation"). As such, we must periodically submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and furnish any other information the Nevada Gaming Authorities may require. No person may become a stockholder of, or receive any percentage of the profits from, the licensed subsidiaries without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Additionally, the CCLGLB has taken the position it has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming licensee. We, and the licensed subsidiaries, possess all state and local government registrations, approvals, permits and licenses required in order for us to engage in gaming activities at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas.
The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with us or the licensed subsidiaries to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Officers, directors and certain key employees of the licensed subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Our officers, directors and key employees who are actively and directly involved in the gaming activities of the licensed subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.
The Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing; both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant for licensing or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by whom the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to have an inappropriate relationship with us or the licensed subsidiaries, we would have to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, the Nevada Commission may require us or the licensed subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.
We, and the licensed subsidiaries, are required to submit periodic detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission. Substantially all of our and our licensed subsidiaries' material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission.
If it were determined we or a licensed subsidiary violated the Nevada Act, the registration and gaming licenses we then hold could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked, subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures. In addition, we and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the casinos, and, under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor's appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the casinos) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming registration or license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming license would) have a material adverse effect on our gaming operations.
Any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have its suitability as a beneficial holder of our voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such investigation.
The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of our voting securities to report the acquisition to the Chairman of the Nevada Board. The Nevada Act requires beneficial owners of more than 10% of our voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability within thirty days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an "institutional investor" as defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of our voting securities (subject to certain additional holdings as a result of certain debt restructurings), may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities only for investment purposes. Additionally, an institutional investor that has been granted such a waiver may acquire more than 25% but not more than 29% of our voting securities if such additional ownership results from a stock re-purchase program and such 
19

institutional investor does not purchase or otherwise acquire any additional voting securities that would result in an increase in its ownership percentage.
An institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities only for investment purposes if it acquires and holds the voting securities in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of our Board of Directors, any change in our corporate charter, by-laws, management, policies or our operations or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities only for investment purposes. Activities deemed consistent with holding voting securities only for investment purposes include:

• | voting on all matters voted on by stockholders;


• | making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in management, policies or operations; and


• | such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

If the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within thirty days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the Chairman of the Nevada Board may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any stockholder found unsuitable who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a registered corporation beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. We are subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or a licensed subsidiary, we, or any of the licensed subsidiaries:

• | pay that person any dividend or interest upon any voting securities;


• | allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;


• | pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or


• | fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including, if necessary, the purchase for cash at fair market value.

Our charter documents include provisions intended to help us comply with these requirements.
The Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of a registered corporation to file an application, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt security of such registered corporation. If the Nevada Commission determines a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the Nevada Act, the registered corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it:

• | pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever;


• | recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities; or


• | pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form.

We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities and we are also required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We are also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner.
We cannot make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or the proceeds from the offering are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities 
20

in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for such purposes. On November 15, 2018, the Nevada Commission granted us prior approval to make public offerings for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions (the "shelf approval"). The shelf approval, however, may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada Board. The shelf approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation, or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the investment merits of any securities offered under the shelf approval. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.
Changes in our control through a merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisition, management or consulting agreement, or any act or conduct by any person whereby he or she obtains control, shall not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a registered corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of such registered corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the transaction.
The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees, and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy to:

• | assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;


• | preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and


• | promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the current market price thereof and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.
The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the Board of Directors in response to a tender offer made directly to our stockholders for the purposes of acquiring control of the registered corporation.
License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending upon the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to Clark County, Nevada. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon:

• | a percentage of the gross revenues received;


• | the number of gaming devices operated; or


• | the number of table games operated.

The tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75% for the State of Nevada and 0.55% for Clark County. In addition, an excise tax is paid by us on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms of live entertainment are provided. VCR is also required to pay certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada as a licensed manufacturer and distributor.
Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or under common control with such persons (collectively, "licensees"), and who proposes to become involved in a gaming operation outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of any investigation by the Nevada Board into their participation in such foreign gaming operation. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, licensees are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if they knowingly violate any laws of any foreign jurisdiction pertaining to such foreign gaming operation, fail to conduct such foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engage in activities harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees, or employ a person in such foreign operation who has 
21

been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of personal unsuitability or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.
The sale of alcoholic beverages by the licensed subsidiaries on the casino premises and at the Sands Expo Center is subject to licensing, control and regulation by the applicable local authorities. Our licensed subsidiaries have obtained the necessary liquor licenses to sell alcoholic beverages. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any such licenses, and any such disciplinary action could (and revocation of such licenses would) have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
Sands Bethworks Gaming is subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board ("PaGCB") and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, the on-site direction of the Pennsylvania State Police and the requirements of other agencies.
On December 20, 2006, we were awarded one of two Category 2 "at large" gaming licenses available in Pennsylvania, which authorizes a licensee to open with up to 3,000 slot machines and to increase to up to 5,000 slot machines upon approval of the PaGCB, which may not take effect earlier than six months after opening.
In July 2007, we paid a $50 million licensing fee to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, in August 2007, were issued our gaming license by the PaGCB. Just prior to the opening of the casino at Sands Bethlehem, we were required to make a deposit of $5 million, which was reduced to $2 million in January 2010 when the law was amended, to cover weekly withdrawals of our share of the cost of regulation and the amount withdrawn must be replenished weekly.
In February 2010, we submitted a petition to the PaGCB to obtain a table games operation certificate to operate table games at Sands Bethlehem, based on a revision to the law in 2010 that authorized table games. The petition was approved in April 2010, we paid a $17 million table game licensing fee in May 2010 and were issued a table games certificate in June 2010. Table games operations commenced on July 18, 2010.
We must notify the PaGCB if we become aware of any proposed or contemplated change of control including more than 5% of the ownership interests of Sands Bethworks Gaming or of more than 5% of the ownership interests of any entity that owns, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of Sands Bethworks Gaming, including LVSC. The acquisition by a person or a group of persons acting in concert of more than 20% of the ownership interests of Sands Bethworks Gaming or of any entity that owns, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of Sands Bethworks Gaming, with the exception of the ownership interest of a person at the time of the original licensure when the license fee was paid, would be defined as a change of control under applicable Pennsylvania gaming law and regulations. Upon a change of control, the acquirer of the ownership interests would be required to qualify for licensure and to pay a new license fee of $50 million or a lesser "change of control" fee as determined by the PaGCB. In December 2007, the PaGCB adopted a $3 million fee to be assessed on an acquirer in connection with a change in control unless special circumstances dictate otherwise. The PaGCB retains the discretion to eliminate the need for qualification and may reduce the license fee upon a change of control. The PaGCB may provide up to 120 days for any person who is required to apply for a license and who is found not qualified to completely divest the person's ownership interest.
Any person who acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more of our voting securities will be required to apply to the PaGCB for licensure, obtain licensure and remain licensed. Licensure requires, among other things, that the applicant establish by clear and convincing evidence the applicant's good character, honesty and integrity. Additionally, any trust that holds 5% or more of our voting securities is required to be licensed by the PaGCB and each individual who is a grantor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust is also required to be licensed by the PaGCB. Under certain circumstances and under the regulations of the PaGCB, an "institutional investor" as defined under the regulations of the PaGCB, which acquires beneficial ownership of 5% or more, but less than 10%, of our voting securities, may not be required to be licensed by the PaGCB provided the institutional investor files an Institutional Notice of Ownership Form with the PaGCB Bureau of Licensing and has filed, and remains eligible to file, a statement of beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G with the SEC as a result of this ownership interest. In addition, any beneficial owner of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares beneficially owned, may be required at the discretion of the PaGCB to file an application for licensure.
22

In the event a security holder is required to be found qualified and is not found qualified, the security holder may be required by the PaGCB to divest of the interest at a price not exceeding the cost of the interest.
Employees
We directly employ approximately 51,500 employees worldwide and hire additional temporary employees on an as-needed basis. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, except as discussed below with respect to certain Sands Expo Center and Sands Bethlehem employees. We believe we have good relations with our employees and any relevant union.
Certain unions have engaged in confrontational and obstructive tactics at some of our properties, including contacting potential customers, tenants and investors, objecting to various administrative approvals and picketing, and may continue these tactics in the future. Although we believe we will be able to operate despite such tactics, no assurance can be given we will be able to do so or the failure to do so would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although no assurances can be given, if employees decide to be represented by labor unions, management does not believe such representation would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Certain culinary personnel are hired from time to time to provide services for trade shows and conventions at Sands Expo Center and are covered under a collective bargaining agreement between Sands Expo Center and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas, for and on behalf of Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 and Bartenders Union, Local No. 165. This collective bargaining agreement expired in December 2000, but automatically renews on an annual basis. As a result, Sands Expo Center is operating under the terms of the expired bargaining agreement with respect to these employees.
Security officers at Sands Bethlehem voted to be represented by a labor union, the International Union, Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America. On March 1, 2017, an initial collective bargaining agreement took effect, which includes a no-strike, no-lockout provision. The collective bargaining agreement expires on March 1, 2020.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property ("IP") portfolio currently consists of trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information. We believe the name recognition, brand identification and image we have developed through our intellectual properties attract customers to our facilities, drive customer loyalty and contribute to our success. We register and protect our IP in the jurisdictions in which we operate or significantly advertise, as well as in countries in which we may operate in the future or wish to ensure protection of our rights.
Agreements Relating to the Malls in Las Vegas
The Grand Canal Shoppes
In May 2004, we completed the sale of The Grand Canal Shoppes and leased to GGP 19 retail and restaurant spaces on the casino level of The Venetian Las Vegas for 89 years with annual rent of one dollar, and GGP assumed our interest as landlord under the various leases associated with these 19 spaces. In addition, we agreed with GGP to:

• | continue to be obligated to fulfill certain lease termination and asset purchase agreements;


• | lease the portion of the theater space located within The Grand Canal Shoppes from GGP for a period of 25 years, subject to an additional 50 years of extension options, with initial fixed minimum rent of $3 million per year;


• | lease the gondola retail store and the canal space located within The Grand Canal Shoppes from GGP (and by amendment the extension of the canal space extended into The Shoppes at The Palazzo) for a period of 25 years, subject to an additional 50 years of extension options, with initial fixed minimum rent of $4 million per year; and


• | lease certain office space from GGP for a period of 10 years, subject to an additional 65 years of extension options, with initial annual rent of approximately $1 million.

23

The lease payments relating to the theater, the canal space within The Grand Canal Shoppes and the office space from GGP are subject to automatic increases of 5% in the sixth lease year and each subsequent fifth lease year.
The Shoppes at The Palazzo
We contracted to sell The Shoppes at The Palazzo to GGP pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of April 12, 2004, as amended (the "Amended Agreement"). Under the Amended Agreement, we also leased to GGP certain restaurant and retail space on the casino level of The Palazzo Tower for 89 years with annual rent of one dollar and GGP assumed our interest as landlord under the various space leases associated with these spaces. On June 24, 2011, we reached a settlement with GGP regarding the final purchase price. Under the terms of the settlement, we retained the $295 million of proceeds previously received and participate in certain potential future revenues earned by GGP.
Cooperation Agreement
Our business plan calls for each of The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, Sands Expo Center and the Grand Canal Shoppes, though separately owned, to be integrally related components of one facility (the "LV Integrated Resort"). In establishing the terms for the integrated operation of these components, the Fourth Amended and Restated Reciprocal Easement, Use and Operating Agreement, dated as of February 29, 2008, by and among Interface Group-Nevada, Inc., Grand Canal Shops II, LLC, Phase II Mall Subsidiary, LLC, VCR, and Palazzo Condo Tower, LLC (the "Cooperation Agreement") sets forth agreements regarding, among other things, encroachments, easements, operating standards, maintenance requirements, insurance requirements, casualty and condemnation, joint marketing, and the sharing of some facilities and related costs. Subject to applicable law, the Cooperation Agreement binds all current and future owners of all portions of the LV Integrated Resort and has priority over the liens securing LVSLLC's senior secured credit facility and in some or all respects any liens that may secure any indebtedness of the owners of any portion of the LV Integrated Resort. Accordingly, subject to applicable law, the obligations in the Cooperation Agreement will "run with the land" if any of the components change hands.
Operating Covenants. The Cooperation Agreement regulates certain aspects of the operation of the LV Integrated Resort. For example, under the Cooperation Agreement, we are obligated to operate The Venetian Resort Las Vegas continuously and to use it exclusively in accordance with standards of first-class Las Vegas Boulevard-style hotels and casinos. We are also obligated to operate and use the Sands Expo Center exclusively in accordance with standards of first-class convention, trade show and exposition centers. The owners of the Grand Canal Shoppes are obligated to operate their property exclusively in accordance with standards of first-class restaurant and retail complexes. For so long as a portion of The Venetian Resort Las Vegas is operated in accordance with a "Venetian" theme, the owner of the Grand Canal Shoppes must operate the section formerly referred to as The Grand Canal Shoppes in accordance with the overall Venetian theme.
Maintenance and Repair. We must maintain The Venetian Resort Las Vegas as well as some common areas and common facilities shared with the Grand Canal Shoppes. The cost of maintenance of all shared common areas and common facilities is to be shared between us and the owners of the Grand Canal Shoppes. We must also maintain, repair and restore Sands Expo Center and certain common areas and common facilities located in Sands Expo Center. The owners of the Grand Canal Shoppes must maintain, repair and restore the Grand Canal Shoppes and certain common areas and common facilities located within.
Insurance. We and the owners of the Grand Canal Shoppes must maintain minimum types and levels of insurance, including property damage, general liability and business interruption insurance. The Cooperation Agreement establishes an insurance trustee to assist in the implementation of the insurance requirements.
Parking. The Cooperation Agreement also addresses issues relating to the use of the LV Integrated Resort's parking facilities and easements for access. The Venetian Resort Las Vegas, Sands Expo Center and the Grand Canal Shoppes may use the parking spaces in the LV Integrated Resort's parking facilities on a "first come, first served" basis. The LV Integrated Resort's parking facilities are owned, maintained and operated by us, with the operating costs proportionately allocated among and/or billed to the owners of the components of the LV Integrated Resort. Each party to the Cooperation Agreement has granted to the others non-exclusive easements and rights to use the roadways and walkways on each other's properties for vehicular and pedestrian access to the parking garages.
24

Utility Easement. All property owners have also granted each other all appropriate and necessary easement rights to utility lines servicing the LV Integrated Resort.
Consents, Approvals and Disputes. If any current or future party to the Cooperation Agreement has a consent or approval right or has discretion to act or refrain from acting, the consent or approval of such party will only be granted and action will be taken or not taken only if a commercially reasonable owner would do so and such consent, approval, action or inaction would not have a material adverse effect on the property owned by such property owner. The Cooperation Agreement provides for the appointment of an independent expert to resolve some disputes between the parties, as well as for expedited arbitration for other disputes.
Sale of the Grand Canal Shoppes by GGP. We have a right of first offer in connection with any proposed sale of the Grand Canal Shoppes by GGP. We also have the right to receive notice of any default by GGP sent by any lender holding a mortgage on the Grand Canal Shoppes, if any, and the right to cure such default subject to our meeting certain net worth tests.
