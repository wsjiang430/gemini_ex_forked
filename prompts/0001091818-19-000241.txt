ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Corporate History, Nature of Business and Merger
 
Galaxy Next Generation, Inc. (Galaxy) is a distributor of interactive learning technology hardware and software that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment. Our products include our own private-label interactive touch screen panel as well as numerous other national and international branded peripheral and communication devices. We provide a multitude of services to our customers, including installation, training, and maintenance.
 
In 2017, Galaxy secured a contract with a large manufacturer of interactive flat panels which would allow for a new panel to be brought to the United States market which far exceeds the current market expectations. These panels are fully connected displays that provide tablet like functionality for the classroom. Teachers and students can interact with content, simultaneously write and draw on the surface, or mirror classroom table activities in a fully engaged and collaborative environment. These panels are available in sizes ranging from 55 to 70 in the 1080P high definition range and from 75 to 98 for the 4K ultra high definition panel. The panels can be wall mounted in a static position or offered as either a fixed or mobile height adjustable option, all with built in speakers. 
 
The current distribution channel consists of 30 resellers across the United States who primarily sell our product within the commercial and educational market. While we do not control where our resellers focus their efforts, based on experience, the kindergarten through 12th grade education market is the largest customer base for the product, comprising nearly 90% of all purchases. In addition, Galaxy possesses its own resell channel that sells directly to the Southeast region of the United States. 
 
We believe the market space for interactive technology in the classroom is a perpetual highway of business opportunity. Public and private school systems are in a continuous race to modernize their learning environments. Our goal is to be an early provider of the best and most modern technology available. 
 
We are striving to become the leader in the market for interactive flat panel technology, associated software and peripheral devices for classrooms. Our goal is to provide an intuitive system to enhance the learning environment and create easy to use technology for the teacher, increasing student engagement and achievement. Our products are developed and backed by a management team with more than 30 combined years in the classroom technology space. 
 
On June 22, 2018, Galaxy consummated a reverse triangular merger whereby Galaxy merged with and into FullCircle Registry, Inc.s (FLCR) newly formed subsidiary, Galaxy MS, Inc. (Galaxy MS or Merger Sub), which was formed specifically for the transaction. Under the terms of the merger, Galaxys shareholders transferred all their outstanding shares of common stock to Galaxy MS, in return for FLCRs Series C Preferred Shares, which were equivalent to approximately 3,065,000,000 shares of the common stock of FLCR on a pre-reverse stock split basis. This represents approximately 89% of the outstanding common stock of FLCR, with the remaining 11% of common stock distributed as follows: (a) an ownership interest of seven percent (7%) to the holders of common stock, pro rata; and (b) four percent (4%) of the common stock to the holders of convertible debt, pro rata. FLCR is an over-the-counter public company traded under the stock symbol FLCR. FLCR owns Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located on approximately seven acres in Indianapolis, Indiana. Prior to the merger, its sole business and source of revenue was from the operation of the theater, and as part of the merger agreement, the parties have the right to spinout the theater to the prior shareholders of FLCR. Effective February 6, 2019, the Company sold its interest in the theater to focus its resources in its technology operations. This filing presents the full year of operations for the technology segment and approximately eight months of activity for the entertainment segment.

Business environment and trends
 
The educational technology market is currently experiencing substantial growth due to government mandates for improving the education results in the United States. Education, governments, corporations and individuals are recognizing the growing need to utilize technology for more effective delivery of information to educate end users. Today, most classrooms are equipped with some type of smart board technology but given the ever-changing nature of technology, previous investments are becoming obsolete. It is believed that 96% of United States classrooms have a need to update their technology. 
 
There are approximately 132,000 primary and secondary schools and 7,000 higher education entities in the United States. The industry has several hundred technology resellers, selling a variety of products, already selling into these entities directly. Our goal is to target the resellers to gain market share growth in the education technology market. 

 Opportunities and plan of operations
 
We believe that our products, both hardware and software, and the products we intend to develop as part of our extensive product road map, positions us to be one of the leading providers of interactive educational products. We believe that the increase in consumer spending along with the ever-evolving increase in standards for curriculum are two driving focuses for the increase in the demand for interactive educational technology. Some additional factors that we believe will impact our opportunity include:
 
Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, United States education expenditure (primary, secondary and post-secondary) has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion, with primary and secondary education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is approximated at roughly triple United States spending for primary and secondary education. 
 
The United States primary and secondary market has always been a point of political debate and scrutiny. With American students ranking far behind other global students in international tests, the United States education system severely impairs the United States economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of Americas global leadership. 
 
The demand for Interactive Flat Panels is on the rise. With traditional interactive whiteboards having been in the market for more than fifteen years, many of these technologies are coming to a refresh period and are being replaced with the newer, more advanced interactive flat panels. 
 
We intend to build upon our proven ability to produce and sell interactive classroom products. We have begun to implement the growth strategies described below and expect to continue to do so over the course of the next couple of upcoming years. In order to implement each goal pertaining to growth, the Company may need additional capital to implement each strategy, particularly in relation to the target acquisition(s) of complementary businesses or technologies. 
 
We intend to grow our business by using the following methodology:
 -4-
 
Capitalizing on market trends in the educational industry: We believe our long history of selling into the K-12 education market provides us with the expertise to continue to stay on the cutting edge of new product development and needs of the classroom teacher. We also believe our expertise in customer service and training positions us well for expected growth. We intend to build our core business by leveraging the strengths of our leadership and building out a solid team with experience and expertise in our market. 
 
Expanding our reseller channel sales: The educational technology industry is driven a lot by relationships. We intend to continue to grow and expand our resellers in strategic geographical regions so that we are able to leverage the relationships in the local school systems within those regions. 
 
Growth through acquisitions: We believe that the interactive and collaborative classroom has many components and moving parts. We intend to stay on the cutting edge of new products by building out our product offerings and line card through strategic acquisitions. The acquisition(s) provides us with significant opportunities to grow our business by adding complementary products to provide a whole classroom G2 experience to our customers. We intend to pursue acquisitions that provide services within our current core product offerings, extend our geographic reach and expand our product offerings. 
  Further developing intellectual property: We intend to build upon our success in developing original software that we own and license to other brands, and distributors globally. When we develop an original software or application, we retain the copyright and patent of that content. We will create additional revenue streams from development fees, brand license fees, distribution license fees and ancillary sources. 
 Expanding our geographic presence: We believe that by expanding our physical presence into select domestic and international regions, we will be better able to attract and retain clients. With a physical presence in strategic locations around the US, we believe we can provide better customer service and offer local services and training resulting in an increase in revenue for those areas.

Competition 
 
The interactive education industry is highly competitive and has frequent product introductions and quick technological advances. With less barriers on the school technology entry, we face heated competition from other interactive panel developers, manufacturers and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive panels and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, Boxlight Inc, Dell Computers, Samsung, Panasonic and ClearTouch. 
Employees

In addition, approximately five individuals provide consulting services as independent contractors. 
 
None of our employees are represented by labor organizations. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent. 
 
Finances
 
The Company continues to grow and as such has incurred a financial loss for the year due to operating cost and expenses. We have put a lot of effort into marketing and branding in this past fiscal year in an effort to grow our recognition within the educational technology industry. The Company monitors the financial liabilities very closely. 
 
The Company has recently entered into an agreement with Maxim Group for investment banking services. 
 
The Company knows that additional capital is needed to grow the revenue at the rate the market is trending and hopes to bring additional investors and shareholders into the Company. If we are successful in raising additional capital, those funds will be used for Company expansion using a M&A strategy, as well as, internally by building out the Companys sales force and improving its marketing efforts.
