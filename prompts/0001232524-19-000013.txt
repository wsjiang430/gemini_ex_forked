Item 1. | Business

Overview
Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc is a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing life-changing medicines for people with limited or no options. As a leader in sleep medicine and with a growing hematology/oncology portfolio, we have a diverse portfolio of products and product candidates in development. 
Our lead marketed products are:

• | Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution, the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, in adult and pediatric patients with narcolepsy;


• | Erwinaze® (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi), a treatment approved in the U.S. and in certain markets in Europe (where it is marketed as Erwinase®) for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase;


• | Defitelio® (defibrotide sodium), a product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, or VOD, also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, or SOS, with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, and in Europe (where it is marketed as Defitelio® (defibrotide)) for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT therapy; and


• | Vyxeos® (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection, a product approved in the U.S. and in Europe (where it is marketed as Vyxeos® 44 mg/100 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, or t-AML, or acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with myelodysplasia-related changes, or AML-MRC.

We are also seeking approval in the U.S. and Europe for solriamfetol as a treatment to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA. The FDA accepted our solriamfetol new drug application, or NDA, for filing with a standard review in early 2018 and the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date is March 20, 2019. We submitted a solriamfetol marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Our strategy to create shareholder value is focused on:

• | Strong financial execution through growth in sales of our current lead marketed products;


• | Building a diversified product portfolio and development pipeline through a combination of our internal research and development efforts and obtaining rights to clinically meaningful and differentiated on- or near-market products and early- to late-stage product candidates through acquisitions, collaborations, licensing arrangements, partnerships and venture investments; and


• | Maximizing the value of our products and product candidates by continuing to implement our comprehensive global development plans, including through generating additional clinical data and seeking regulatory approval for new indications.

In 2018, in support of our strategy, we continued to expand and advance our research and development pipeline in our sleep and hematology/oncology therapeutic areas, both by conducting activities internally and by leveraging partnerships with third parties. For a summary of our ongoing research and development activities, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1.
Our Commercialized Products
Xyrem
Xyrem is the only treatment approved by the FDA and marketed in the U.S. for both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Xyrem, is a formulation of the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous neurotransmitter and metabolite of gamma-aminobutyric acid. 
Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a loss of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter hypocretin (also known as orexin), which is hypothesized to stabilize sleep-wake states. The primary symptoms of narcolepsy include EDS, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnogogic hallucinations and disrupted nighttime sleep. EDS is an essential symptom of narcolepsy, is present in all narcolepsy patients and is characterized by chronic, pervasive sleepiness as well as sudden irresistible and overwhelming urges to sleep (inadvertent naps and sleep attacks). Cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle tone, can be one of the most debilitating symptoms of narcolepsy. Cataplexy is present in approximately 70% of patients with narcolepsy. Cataplexy can range from slight weakness or a drooping of facial muscles to the complete loss of muscle tone resulting in postural collapse. It may also impair a patient’s vision or speech. Cataplexy is often triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, anger or surprise. Cataplexy can severely impair a patient’s quality of life and ability to function. 
Narcolepsy may affect many areas of life, including limiting a patient’s education and employment opportunities, and may lead to difficulties at work, school, or in daily life activities like driving, operating machinery or caring for children. Patients with narcolepsy may also suffer from significant medical comorbidities, including depression, suicide risk, anxiety, diseases of the digestive system, respiratory diseases and cardiac disorders.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the average number of active Xyrem patients in the U.S. was approximately 14,300, and we believe that there are significantly more patients with narcolepsy who might benefit from treatment with Xyrem. In an effort to reach more patients, we continue to implement initiatives such as outreach to prescribers who treat narcolepsy, physician/healthcare provider education, enhanced patient and physician support services and unbranded disease awareness programs for the public.
Xyrem was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy in 2002 and was approved for EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy in 2005. In October 2018, Xyrem was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in pediatric narcolepsy patients ages seven and older. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends Xyrem as a standard of care for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS associated with narcolepsy. 
We have had exclusive agreements with Express Scripts Specialty Distribution Services, Inc., or Express Scripts, the central pharmacy for Xyrem, to distribute Xyrem in the U.S. and provide patient support services related to Xyrem since 2002. Our current agreement with Express Scripts expires on July 1, 2019, but we expect to exercise our right to extend the agreement for an additional year. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time without cause on 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party. We own all standard operating procedures, business rules and the related intellectual property for the services Express Scripts provides related to patient support programs. The agreement provides for Express Scripts to assist in the orderly transfer of the services that Express Scripts provides to us and the related intellectual property, including intellectual property related to the patient database, to any new pharmacy that we may engage.
Our marketing, sales and distribution of Xyrem in the U.S. are subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which is required by the FDA to mitigate the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, abuse, misuse and diversion of Xyrem. Under the Xyrem REMS, all of the Xyrem sold in the U.S. must be 
4

dispensed and shipped directly to patients or caregivers through a central pharmacy. Xyrem may not be stocked in retail pharmacies. Physicians and patients must complete an enrollment process prior to fulfillment of Xyrem prescriptions, and each physician and patient must receive materials concerning the serious risks associated with Xyrem before the physician can prescribe, or a patient can receive, the product. The central certified pharmacy must monitor and report instances of patient or prescriber behavior giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of abuse, misuse or diversion of Xyrem, and maintains enrollment and prescription monitoring information in a central database. The central pharmacy ships the product directly to the patient (or caregiver) by a courier service. 
For more information regarding research and development activities in our sleep franchise, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1.
In 2018, net product sales of Xyrem were $1.4 billion, which represented 75% of our total net product sales.
Erwinaze
Erwinaze (called Erwinase in markets outside the U.S., and which we refer to in this report as Erwinaze unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires) is a biologic product used in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat patients with ALL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. Originally developed by Public Health England, a national executive agency of the United Kingdom, or UK, Erwinaze is an asparaginase, a type of enzyme that can deprive leukemic cells of an amino acid essential for their growth. It is derived from a rare bacterium (Erwinia chrysanthemi) and is immunologically distinct from E. coli-derived asparaginase and suitable for patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived treatments. 
For ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, Erwinaze can be a crucial component of their therapeutic regimen. Current treatment guidelines and protocols recommend switching a patient receiving E. coli-derived asparaginase to treatment with Erwinaze if the patient’s hypersensitivity reaction to the E. coli-derived asparaginase is Grade 2-4, indicating that the hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in an intervention or interruption in infusion occurring in the patient’s treatment regimen. While pediatric treatment protocols commonly include asparaginase, adult protocols do not. 
First approved by the FDA under a biologics license application, or BLA, for administration via intramuscular injection in conjunction with chemotherapy, Erwinaze was launched in the U.S. in 2011. In 2014, the FDA approved a supplemental BLA for administration of Erwinaze via intravenous infusion in conjunction with chemotherapy. 
Erwinaze is exclusively licensed to us for worldwide marketing, sales and distribution by Porton Biopharma Limited, or PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Secretary of State for Health. PBL also manufactures the product for us and is our sole supplier for Erwinaze. We are obligated to make tiered royalty payments to PBL based on worldwide net sales of Erwinaze. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes our license for Erwinaze, expires on December 31, 2020. We and PBL had been engaged in discussions related to entry into a replacement agreement to extend the term of our commercial relationship with respect to Erwinaze past 2020, but we did not reach agreement. Unless we and PBL enter into a new agreement, we will lose our license to Erwinaze after December 31, 2020, other than our right to sell certain Erwinaze inventory for a post-termination sales period of 12 months. Either party also has the right to terminate the agreement prior to its expiration in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency.
To expand our asparaginase franchise beyond Erwinaze, we are pursuing activities related to the development of improved asparaginase products for patients with ALL or other hematological malignancies. For more information, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1.
In 2018, net product sales of Erwinaze were $174.7 million, which represented 9% of our total net product sales.
Defitelio
Defibrotide, the API in Defitelio, has been approved for the treatment of VOD, a potentially life-threatening complication of HSCT, and is in development for other complications following HSCT, including prevention of VOD, prevention of acute Graft versus Host Disease, or aGvHD, and treatment of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TA-TMA, as well as complications following anti-cancer treatment, including prevention of CAR-T-associated neurotoxicity.  Defibrotide is the sodium salt of a complex mixture of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from porcine DNA.  Defibrotide mediates its effects via interaction with endothelial cells.  Non-clinical data suggest that defibrotide stabilizes endothelial cells by reducing endothelial cell activation and by protecting them from further damage.
 Stem cell transplantation is a frequently used treatment modality for hematologic cancers and other conditions in both adults and children. Certain conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT can damage the cells that line the hepatic vessels, which is thought to lead to the development of VOD, also referred to as SOS, a blockage of the small vessels in the liver, that can lead to liver failure and potentially result in significant dysfunction in other organs such as the kidneys and lungs. Severe VOD is the most extreme form of VOD and is associated with multi-organ failure and high rates of morbidity and mortality. 
5

An analysis of retrospective data, prospective cohort studies and clinical trials published between 1979 and 2007 found that the 100-day mortality rate in severe VOD cases is greater than 80%. 
The European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for Defitelio for the treatment of severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT in 2013. We commenced a rolling launch of Defitelio in European countries in 2014. In countries where we currently commercialize Defitelio, we are working to maintain current levels of market access. 
In 2016, the FDA approved our NDA for Defitelio for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with VOD with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT. We launched Defitelio in the U.S. shortly after FDA approval. We acquired the rights to defibrotide for the treatment and prevention of VOD in North America, Central America and South America from Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sigma-Tau, in 2014. In exchange for these rights, we made an upfront payment of $75.0 million to Sigma-Tau and also made milestone payments of $175.0 million comprised of (i) $25.0 million upon the acceptance for filing by the FDA of the first NDA for defibrotide for VOD, paid in the fourth quarter of 2015; and (ii) an additional final payment of $150.0 million upon FDA approval of defibrotide for VOD, paid in the second quarter of 2016.
We launched defibrotide in Canada in 2017. In October 2018, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., the partner to whom we have granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize defibrotide in Japan, announced that it had filed an NDA for defibrotide with Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. 
We are also developing defibrotide for other potential indications. For more information regarding defibrotide development activities, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1. 
In 2018, Defitelio/defibrotide product sales were $149.4 million, which represented 8% of our total net product sales.
Vyxeos
Vyxeos is a liposome formulation of a fixed ratio combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine for intravenous infusion that is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC and has been shown to have synergistic effects at killing leukemia cells in vitro and in animal models. Vyxeos is the first drug delivery combination product based on our CombiPlex technology platform to be approved by the FDA and the EC.
AML is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow, which produces most of the body's new blood cells.  AML cells crowd out healthy cells and move aggressively into the bloodstream to spread cancer to other parts of the body.  AML is a relatively rare disease representing about 1% of all new cancer cases and has the lowest survival rate of any form of leukemia. Patients with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC may have a particularly poor prognosis.  
In 2017, we launched Vyxeos in the U.S. after the FDA approved our NDA for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. In August 2018, the EC granted marketing authorization for Vyxeos, and, shortly thereafter, we commenced a rolling launch of Vyxeos in the European Union, or EU.  
For more information regarding our CombiPlex technology platform and Vyxeos development activities, see “Business—Research and Development” in this Part I, Item 1. 
In 2018, Vyxeos product sales were $100.8 million, which represented 5% of our total net product sales. 
Other Products
We also sell psychiatry and other products in the U.S. and certain markets outside the U.S.
In September 2018, we sold substantially all of the assets held by us related to Prialt® (ziconotide) intrathecal infusion to TerSera Therapeutics LLC.
Research and Development
A key aspect of our growth strategy is continued investment in our evolving and expanding research and development pipeline. We actively explore innovative product candidates ranging from small molecules to biologics. While we are primarily focused on opportunities within our sleep and hematology/oncology therapeutic areas, we are also interested in and exploring adjacent therapeutic areas, including central nervous system disorders and solid tumors. 
Our development activities encompass all stages of development and currently include clinical testing of new product candidates and activities related to clinical improvements of, or additional indications or new clinical data for, our commercialized products. We have also recently expanded into preclinical exploration of novel therapies, including precision medicines in hematology and oncology. We conduct most of these activities by leveraging our growing internal research and development function, but we have also entered into collaborations with third parties for the research and development of early-
6

stage product candidates and have supported third parties seeking to perform clinical studies that will generate additional data related to our marketed products. We also seek out investment opportunities in support of development of early-stage technologies in our therapeutic areas and adjacencies.
Our current and planned development activities in our sleep therapeutic area are primarily focused on two product candidates, solriamfetol and JZP-258. 
Solriamfetol. Solriamfetol is a small molecule new chemical entity being developed for potential treatment of EDS in several disorders and conditions, including OSA and narcolepsy. The FDA accepted our solriamfetol NDA for filing with a standard review in early 2018, and the current PDUFA goal date is March 20, 2019. We submitted a solriamfetol MAA to the EMA in the fourth quarter of 2018. We also recently conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial of solriamfetol in patients with EDS associated with Parkinson’s disease and are evaluating future pipeline expansion opportunities in other disorders and conditions, as well as opportunities for geographic expansion. We acquired worldwide development, manufacturing and commercial rights to solriamfetol from Aerial BioPharma LLC, or Aerial, in 2014, other than in certain jurisdictions in Asia where SK Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd, or SK, retains rights. 
JZP-258. JZP-258 is an oxybate product candidate that contains 90% less sodium than Xyrem and is being developed for the potential treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy and potential treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia, or IH, a chronic neurological disorder that is primarily characterized by EDS. Given the well-accepted relationship between dietary sodium and blood pressure as well as published hypertension guidelines underscoring that excessive consumption of sodium is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease and other adverse outcomes, we believe that lower sodium intake would be beneficial for patients and therefore JZP-258 would offer a clinically meaningful benefit to patients compared to Xyrem.  We have conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial of JZP-258 in patients for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy and, subject to the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial, we expect to submit an NDA by as early as the end of 2019. We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of IH, which currently has no approved therapies in the U.S. We are also pursuing early-stage activities related to the potential development of an extended release oxybate formulation that we believe could provide a clinically meaningful option for some narcolepsy patients.
Our current and planned development activities in our hematology/oncology therapeutic area are focused on exploring additional indications for Defitelio and Vyxeos, generating additional clinical data for Vyxeos, including in combination with other therapeutic agents, and the research and development of new product candidates. 
Defitelio. Our Defitelio clinical development strategy generally focuses on the prevention and treatment of serious diseases associated with endothelial cell damage. In addition to clinical trials we are sponsoring, there are more than 20 investigator-sponsored trials ongoing in the U.S. and EU to evaluate defibrotide in multiple conditions. 
Vyxeos. Our Vyxeos clinical development strategy is designed to target potential new patient segments across the AML landscape, to pursue indications related to myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, and to generate clinical data on Vyxeos when used in combination with other therapeutic agents. As reflected in the table below, we are pursuing this strategy by sponsoring clinical trials, working with cooperative groups who are conducting clinical trials, and partnering with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MD Anderson. In August 2018, we announced a five-year collaboration with MD Anderson to evaluate potential treatment options for hematologic malignancies, with a near-term focus on Vyxeos, and shortly thereafter, commenced development activities under this collaboration. In addition, there are multiple ongoing investigator-sponsored trials studying Vyxeos.
CombiPlex Platform. We are also evaluating the use of our CombiPlex delivery technology platform in a number of therapeutic combinations in oncology as part of our internal oncology research and development activities. CombiPlex enables the design and rapid evaluation of various combinations of therapies to deliver enhanced anti-cancer activity by identifying an optimal synergistic ratio of drugs in vitro and fixing this ratio in a nanoscale delivery complex that maintains and then coordinates the release of the synergistic combination after administration.  CombiPlex utilizes two proprietary nanoscale delivery platforms: liposomes to control the release and distribution of water-soluble drugs and drugs that are both water- and fat-soluble (amphipathic), and nanoparticles to control the release and distribution of non-water-soluble (hydrophobic) drugs. We are conducting preclinical activities using our CombiPlex platform to develop a novel combination of therapeutic agents that are designed to target an undisclosed solid tumor candidate, as well as other hematology/oncology exploratory activities. 
Through third parties, we are also pursuing preclinical and clinical research and development activities in hematology and in precision oncology under a number of licensing and collaboration agreements, including with:

• | ImmunoGen, Inc., or ImmunoGen, for opt-in rights to license two hematology-related antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, product candidates granted orphan drug designation by the FDA, as well as an additional ADC product candidate;

7


• | Codiak BioSciences, Inc., or Codiak, for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize potential therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak's engEx™ precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics;


• | Pfenex, Inc., or Pfenex, for rights to multiple early-stage hematology product candidates and an option to negotiate a license for a recombinant pegaspargase product candidate; and


• | XL-protein GmbH, or XLp, for rights to use XLp’s PASylation® technology to extend the plasma half-life of selected asparaginase product candidates.

Below is a summary of ongoing and planned development projects related to our products and pipeline and their corresponding current stages of development:

In 2019 and beyond, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase from historical levels, particularly as we prepare for anticipated regulatory submissions and trial data read-outs, initiate and undertake additional clinical trials and related development work and potentially acquire rights to additional product candidates. 
Sales and Marketing
We have commercial operations primarily in the U.S., Europe and Canada. In the U.S., our products are marketed through our commercial teams, including experienced sales professionals who promote Xyrem, Erwinaze, Defitelio and Vyxeos directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. 
In Canada and in approved markets in Europe where we commercialize Erwinaze, Defitelio and Vyxeos, we have a field force of hematology field specialists comprised of sales personnel and medical affairs personnel. In markets where these products either are not approved or are unable to be promoted under local regulation, we have medical science liaisons and medical directors responsible for responding to medical information requests and for providing information consistent with local treatment protocols with respect to such products. Outside the U.S., we directly market Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. We also utilize distributors in certain markets outside the U.S. where we do not market our products directly. 
Our commercial activities include marketing related services, distribution services and commercial support services. We employ third party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. We also provide reimbursement support for our U.S. markets. 
Although we have a relatively small number of sales representatives compared with most other pharmaceutical companies with marketed products, we believe that the size of our sales force is appropriate to effectively reach our target audience in the specialty markets in which we currently operate. We promote Defitelio, Erwinaze and Vyxeos to many hematology and oncology specialists who operate in the same hospitals, and we believe that we benefit from operational synergies from this overlap. Continued growth of our current marketed products and the launch of any future products, including potentially solriamfetol, may require further expansion of our sales force and sales support organization in the U.S. and internationally. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete, and our product candidates may in the future compete, with currently existing therapies, product candidates currently under development by others and/or future product candidates, including new chemical entities that may turn out to be safer or more effective than our products. Any products that we develop may be commercialized in competitive markets, and our competitors, which include large global pharmaceutical companies and small research-based companies and institutions, may succeed in developing products that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. 
We also face competition, and may in the future face additional competition, from manufacturers of generic drugs. Certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available. Generic competition often results in decreases in the prices at which branded products can be sold. 
In particular, our products and most advanced product candidates face or may face competition as described below: 

• | Xyrem. While Xyrem is currently the only product approved by the FDA and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both cataplexy and EDS in patients with narcolepsy, we and others may launch products as treatment options in cataplexy and/or EDS in narcolepsy, including other branded sodium oxybate products and other new and existing branded market entrants. In addition, Xyrem will face competition from generics and authorized generics. 

9

Nine companies have filed abbreviated NDAs, or ANDAs, with the FDA seeking to market generic versions of Xyrem, and we have settled patent litigation against all of them. To date, the FDA has approved or tentatively approved three of these ANDAs, and we believe that it is likely that the FDA will approve or tentatively approve additional ANDAs.  Under the settlement agreements with the nine ANDA filers, (i) we granted the first ANDA filer, West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC) the right to sell an authorized generic version of Xyrem, or AG Product, in the U.S. beginning on January 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances, and a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product as early as six months after it has the right to sell the AG Product, unless it elects to continue to sell the AG Product, which it may do for up to a total of five years; (ii) we granted each of three of the other ANDA filers the right to sell a limited volume of an AG Product in the U.S. beginning on July 1, 2023, or earlier under certain circumstances, and a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances; and (iii) we granted each of the five other ANDA filers a license to launch its own generic sodium oxybate product on or after December 31, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. We will receive royalties on sales of the AG products. The actual timing of the launch of an AG Product or generic sodium oxybate product is uncertain because the launch dates of the AG Products and generic sodium oxybate products under our ANDA litigation settlement agreements are subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. For a further description of the settlement agreements, including a more complete description of circumstances that might trigger acceleration of such dates, see the risk factor under the heading “The introduction of a new product in the U.S. market that competes with, or otherwise disrupts the market for, Xyrem would adversely affect sales of Xyrem” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc, or Avadel, is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of a once-nightly formula of sodium oxybate which uses its proprietary technology for the treatment of EDS and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Avadel has indicated that it intends to seek approval using an NDA approval pathway under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, by referencing Xyrem and relying, to some degree, on the FDA’s approval of Xyrem and related determinations of safety and efficacy. Other companies may develop a sodium oxybate or similar product using, for example, an alternative formulation or a different delivery technology, and seek approval in the U.S. under Section 505(b)(2) or otherwise. For a further description of the approval process for ANDAs and NDAs under the FDA’s Section 505(b)(2) approval pathway, see “Business—Government Regulation—Marketing Exclusivity—The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Part I, Item 1.
Although Xyrem is currently the only approved treatment for EDS and cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, we are aware that prescribers often prescribe branded or generic medications for these conditions before prescribing or instead of prescribing Xyrem, and that payors often require patients to try such medications before they will cover Xyrem. For example, prescribers often treat mild cataplexy with drugs that have not been approved by the FDA for that indication, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. In addition, we are aware that Harmony Biosciences LLC, or Harmony, has exclusive U.S. rights to seek approval of and commercialize pitolisant, a wake-promoting drug that has already been approved in Europe to treat adult patients with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. Published data and prescribing patterns in the EU suggest that pitolisant would likely be appropriately used in patients with less severe cataplexy than those treated with Xyrem. While pitolisant is not currently approved in the U.S., Harmony has established an expanded access program for pitolisant, received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations from the FDA and, in February 2019, announced that the FDA had accepted for filing with priority review its pitolisant NDA. We are also aware that branded or generic stimulants may be prescribed off label for treatment of EDS in narcolepsy. Wake-promoting agents Provigil® (modafinil) and Nuvigil® (armodafinil), and their generic equivalents, are labeled for treatment of EDS in narcolepsy and other conditions, and may be used in conjunction with or instead of Xyrem. It is possible that additional branded or generic products may be introduced to treat symptoms of narcolepsy that will similarly be prescribed before or instead of Xyrem, or that payors will require patients to try before they will cover Xyrem. 

• | Erwinaze. Erwinaze is a biologic product used in conjunction with chemotherapy and is indicated for patients with ALL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. While there is currently no direct competition to Erwinaze to treat ALL patients with hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase, other companies have developed or are developing new treatments for ALL. Some new asparaginase treatments could reduce the rate of hypersensitivity in patients with ALL, and new treatment protocols are being developed for ALL that may not include asparaginase-containing regimens, including some for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL patients. We have experienced frequent intermittent shortages of the product, as described in “Business—Manufacturing” in this Part I, Item 1, that have impacted prescribing habits for Erwinaze, including prescribers’ use of alternate methods to address hypersensitivity reactions. The development of these new treatments could negatively impact our ability to grow sales of Erwinaze in patient populations where the benefit of an asparaginase-containing regimen is not well established. As a biologic product, Erwinaze also faces potential competition from biosimilar products.

• | Defitelio. Defitelio is the only approved treatment in the U.S. for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with VOD, also known as SOS, with renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT and the only approved treatment in the EU for severe VOD in adults and children undergoing HSCT. Various anti-clotting strategies have been tried by researchers in patients with VOD with mixed results, including Activase (alteplase), a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator marketed by Genentech, Inc., generic heparin sodium injection and Thrombate III (antithrombin III (human)) marketed by Grifols Therapeutics, Inc. While there is currently no direct competition to Defitelio to treat severe VOD, changes in the types of conditioning regimens used as part of HSCT may affect the incidence rate of VOD and demand for Defitelio. 


• | Vyxeos. There are a number of alternative established and recently introduced therapies in AML. A key consideration in the treatment of AML patients is the patient’s suitability for chemotherapy. The AML patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial supporting our NDA included fit patients, or those deemed able to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy. The existing options for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML and AML-MRC in fit patients include cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline (i.e., daunorubicin), known as 7+3. In addition, we are aware of several other products that have been recently approved by the FDA or are in development as treatment options for newly diagnosed AML patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy, such as targeted agents (e.g. midostaurin, enasidenib and ivosidenib), immunotherapies (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin and CAR-T‑cell therapy), and agents disrupting leukemia cell survival (e.g., glasdegib). We are also aware of the use of venetoclax, an AML treatment recently approved by the FDA. Some of the patient populations being studied for, or treated by, these products overlap with the patient population studied in the Vyxeos Phase 3 clinical trial supporting our NDA. The existence of established treatment options and the development of competing products for the treatment of newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC could negatively impact our ability to successfully commercialize Vyxeos and achieve the level of sales we expect. 


• | Solriamfetol. As discussed above, other branded and generic products used to treat EDS in patients with narcolepsy include stimulants, wake-promoting agents such as Provigil and Nuvigil, and generic versions of stimulants and wake-promoting agents. We are also aware that stimulants and wake-promoting agents are prescribed for patients who have OSA. Solriamfetol, if approved by the FDA, will likely face competition from this genericized market. In addition, we are aware of several other products in development to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy or OSA, including, for example, pitolisant, mazindol, modafinil combinations and Avadel’s once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation. 

An important part of our corporate strategy is to build a diversified product pipeline, including by acquiring or in-licensing and developing additional products and product candidates that we believe are highly differentiated and have significant commercial potential. Our ability to continue to grow our product portfolio requires that we compete successfully with other pharmaceutical companies to acquire or in-license products and product candidates. These competitors include established companies that may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size and financial resources.
For more information on the competitive risks we face generally, see the risk factors under the headings “We face substantial competition from other companies, including companies with larger sales organizations and more experience working with large and diverse product portfolios” and “We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates to grow our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Customers 
In the U.S., our lead marketed product, Xyrem, is sold to one specialty pharmacy, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, which ships Xyrem directly to patients. Erwinaze, Defitelio and Vyxeos are sold to hospital customers through subsidiary specialty distributors of McKesson Corporation, or McKesson. We have distribution services agreements made in the ordinary course of business with McKesson and a pharmacy services agreement with Express Scripts that provides for the distribution of Xyrem to patients. For more information regarding our relationship with Express Scripts, see “Business—Our Commercialized Products” in this Part I, Item 1. Purchases are made on a purchase order basis.
In certain countries in Europe, Erwinase, Defitelio and Vyxeos are sold pursuant to marketing authorizations. We distribute these products through Durbin PLC, a UK-based wholesaler and distributor, and O&M Movianto Nederland BV, our centralized European logistics services provider, to hospitals and local wholesalers in Europe where we market these products directly and, in other markets in Europe and elsewhere where we do not market these products directly, to local distributors and wholesalers. In countries where there is no marketing authorization, Erwinase, Defitelio and Vyxeos are sold pursuant to named patient programs, temporary use authorizations or similar authorizations. 
11

We directly market Xyrem in Canada for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Xyrem is also sold in 21 countries by UCB Pharma Limited, or UCB (which has rights to market Xyrem in 54 countries). 
Information on our total revenues by product and revenues attributed to customers who represented at least 10% of our total revenues in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016 is included in Note 17, Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Manufacturing 
We have a manufacturing and development facility in Athlone, Ireland where we manufacture Xyrem and development-stage oxybate product candidates, including JZP-258. We also have a manufacturing plant in Italy where we produce the defibrotide drug substance. Other than these two facilities, we currently do not have our own commercial manufacturing capability for our products and product candidates or their APIs. As a result, our ability to develop and supply products in a timely and competitive manner depends primarily on our third party suppliers, in most cases single source suppliers, being able to meet our ongoing commercial and clinical trial needs. 
Lead Marketed Products
Xyrem. Xyrem is manufactured by us in our Athlone facility and by Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., which we refer to together with its affiliates as Patheon, under a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Patheon Agreement, entered into with Patheon in 2015. The Patheon Agreement establishes the general terms and conditions pursuant to which Patheon provides manufacturing services for multiple drug products, including Xyrem, as specified by us in product agreements we enter into from time to time. Although we manufacture Xyrem in our Athlone facility, we expect to rely on Patheon as our sole U.S.-based supplier of Xyrem for the foreseeable future. However, we are not required to purchase Xyrem exclusively from Patheon. The Patheon Agreement expires on December 31, 2020 and may be extended for additional two-year terms if Patheon is then providing manufacturing services for any product, unless either party provides 18 months’ prior notice of termination. In addition, we may terminate the Patheon Agreement for any reason upon 12 months’ prior written notice, and each party has the right to terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach.
Siegfried USA, LLC, or Siegfried, supplies sodium oxybate, the API of Xyrem, to Patheon and, through a Siegfried affiliate in Europe, to our Athlone facility. Although Siegfried has been our only supplier of sodium oxybate since 2012, we have the right to purchase a portion of our worldwide requirements of sodium oxybate from other suppliers. Under our agreement, entered into in 2010, we provide periodic rolling forecasts to Siegfried, and a portion of each rolling forecast constitutes a firm purchase order. The agreement with Siegfried expires in April 2021, subject to automatic three-year extensions until either party provides notice to the other of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 18 months before the end of the then-current term. Each party also has the right to terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. During the term of the agreement and, under certain circumstances for 18 months after the agreement terminates, Siegfried is not permitted to manufacture sodium oxybate for any other company.
Xyrem is a controlled substance in the U.S., subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. As a result, its manufacturing and distribution are highly restricted. Quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package sodium oxybate and Xyrem in the U.S. For information related to DEA quota requirements, see “Business—Government Regulation—Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation—Controlled Substance Regulations” in this Part I, Item 1.
Erwinaze. Erwinaze is exclusively licensed to us, and manufactured for us, by PBL, a company that is wholly owned by the UK Secretary of State for Health. PBL is our sole supplier for Erwinaze. Our license and supply agreement with PBL, which includes our license for Erwinaze, expires on December 31, 2020. For information related to our agreement with PBL, see “Business—Our Commercialized Products—Erwinaze” in this Part I, Item 1. We provide periodic rolling forecasts to PBL, and a portion of each rolling forecast constitutes a firm purchase order. The Erwinaze BLA includes a number of post-marketing commitments related to the manufacture of Erwinaze by PBL.
A continuing and significant challenge to maintaining sales of Erwinaze and a barrier to increasing sales is PBL’s inability to consistently supply product adequate to meet market demand. All Erwinaze that PBL has been able to supply is currently completely absorbed by demand for the product. In addition, PBL is subject to a January 2017 warning letter issued by the FDA citing significant violations of the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, as well as an inspection report from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, listing several major findings, including major deficiencies and failures by PBL to comply with cGMP. PBL’s product quality and manufacturing issues have resulted, and continue to result, in disruptions in our ability to supply markets from time to time and have caused, and may in the future cause, us to implement batch-specific, modified product use instructions. We have been experiencing, and continue to experience, supply disruptions globally and expect further supply disruptions during 2019.  These supply disruptions will continue to adversely impact our ability to generate sales of and revenues from Erwinaze and our business, financial condition, 
12

results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. For a more complete description of supply issues related to Erwinaze, see the risk factor under the heading “Delays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or our for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Defitelio/defibrotide. We are our sole supplier of, and we believe that we are currently the sole worldwide producer of, the defibrotide drug compound. We manufacture the defibrotide compound from porcine DNA in a single facility located in Villa Guardia, near Como, Italy. Patheon currently processes the defibrotide compound into its finished vial form under a specific product agreement entered into under the Patheon Agreement. Patheon is the sole provider of our commercial and clinical supply of Defitelio; however, we are not required to purchase Defitelio exclusively from Patheon. If Patheon does not or is not able to supply us with Defitelio for any reason, it may take time and resources to implement and execute the necessary technology transfer to another processor, and such delay could negatively impact our anticipated revenues from Defitelio and could potentially cause us to breach contractual obligations with customers or to violate local laws requiring us to deliver the product to those in need.
Vyxeos. Vyxeos is manufactured by Baxter Oncology GmbH, or Baxter, which is a sole source supplier from a single site location, using our CombiPlex technology platform. CombiPlex products represent formulations with increased manufacturing complexities associated with producing drug delivery vehicles encapsulating two or more drugs that are maintained at a fixed ratio and, in the case of Vyxeos, two drugs that are co-encapsulated in a freeze-dried format. There have been batch failures at Baxter due to mechanical, component and other issues, and batches have been produced that have otherwise not been in compliance with applicable specifications. We are continuing to work with Baxter to address manufacturing complexities. Our manufacturing agreement with Baxter expires in August 2022, subject to automatic three-year renewal terms, unless terminated by either party 24 months prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement for breach, subject to customary cure periods, and each party may terminate the agreement immediately in the event of the other party’s insolvency. While other contract manufacturers may be able to produce Vyxeos, the proprietary technology that supports the manufacture of Vyxeos is not easily transferable. The marketing authorization in the EU for Vyxeos also requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments. 
Product Candidates 
Siegfried has supplied us with both the API and finished product for our development activities involving solriamfetol. We expect that Siegfried will manufacture and supply solriamfetol for commercial sale if solriamfetol receives regulatory approval and that, in the short term, Siegfried will be the sole provider of our commercial supply of solriamfetol. We also expect that solriamfetol, if approved, will be subject to scheduling by the DEA after NDA approval. 
JZP-258 is currently manufactured at our Athlone facility, and we expect to manufacture this product commercially at our Athlone facility should this candidate proceed through development and receive regulatory approval.  
For further discussion of the challenges we face with respect to supply of our products and product candidates, see the risk factor under the heading “Delays or problems in the supply of our products for sale or our for use in clinical trials, loss of our single source suppliers or failure to comply with manufacturing regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek to patent, or to acquire or obtain licenses to third party patents, to protect our products and product candidates and related inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business. We own a portfolio of U.S and non-U.S. patents and patent applications and have licensed rights to a number of issued patents and patent applications. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including certain formulations, used to treat particular conditions, distribution methods and methods of administration, drug delivery technologies and delivery profiles and methods of production. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The patent laws of non-U.S. countries differ from those in U.S., and the degree of protection afforded by non-U.S. patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents. In addition to patents, our products and product candidates are in some instances protected by various marketing exclusivities. For a description of those exclusivities and their regulatory background, see “Business—Government Regulation—Marketing Exclusivity—The Hatch-Waxman Act” in this Part I, Item 1 and in the risk factor under the heading “It is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
13

The patents, patent applications and marketing exclusivities that relate to our marketed products and product candidates include:

• | Xyrem. We currently have 16 issued patents in the U.S. relating to Xyrem that expire at various times from December 2019 to September 2033. All but four of these patents are listed in the FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” or the Orange Book. Our patents relate to Xyrem’s stable and microbially resistant formulation, its manufacturing process, its method of use, including its restricted distribution system, its method of administration, and a drug-drug interaction, or DDI, between Xyrem and divalproex sodium. In October 2018, as a result of the FDA’s grant of pediatric exclusivity, an additional six months was added to the expiration dates of all of our Orange Book-listed patents that have not been invalidated. 

Our Xyrem patents have been subject to patent litigation with the companies who filed ANDAs seeking to market a generic version of Xyrem, including challenge through the inter partes review procedures of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. In July 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld on appeal PTAB decisions finding that six patents associated with the Xyrem REMS and three claims of a seventh REMS patent are unpatentable. As a result, we will not be able to enforce patents or claims that the PTAB found unpatentable. Although we have settled all patent litigation against the nine companies that filed ANDAs, it is possible that additional companies may challenge our U.S. patents for Xyrem in the future. For a description of our Xyrem settlements, see the risk factor under the heading “Risks Related to Xyrem and Our Other Marketed Products” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
A Xyrem formulation patent has issued in multiple non-U.S. countries and will expire in December 2019. The European Patent Office has issued a method of administration patent relating to the DDI between Xyrem and divalproex sodium that will expire in February 2034. Those patents are licensed to UCB as the marketing authorization holder outside of the U.S. and Canada, and UCB has the right to enforce them. In addition to our issued patents, we have patent applications relating to Xyrem pending in the U.S. and other countries. 

• | Erwinaze. Erwinaze has no patent protection. It had been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in the U.S. until November 2018, and we believe that it is protected by exclusivity that prevents approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. through late 2023 under the U.S. Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA. 


• | Defitelio. The unique process of deriving defibrotide from porcine DNA is extensive and uses both chemical and biological processes that rely on complex characterization methods. We have U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications relating to various compositions, methods of use and methods of characterization, expiring at various times between June 2019 and November 2035. None of these patents are listed in the Orange Book. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA to treat and prevent VOD until March 2023. Defibrotide has also been granted orphan drug designation by the EC and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD, by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health for the treatment of VOD and by the EC for the prevention of aGvHD. 


• | Vyxeos. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for Vyxeos and the CombiPlex technology platform relating to various compositions and methods of making and use. These include six U.S. patents covering Vyxeos compositions and methods of use expiring between April 2025 and September 2034 and two U.S. patents covering CombiPlex (which also cover Vyxeos) expiring in January 2027. These patents are listed, or in the process of being listed, in the Orange Book. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA until August 2024, seven years from its FDA approval, for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. In addition, Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC until August 2028, ten years from its EC approval for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. 


• | Solriamfetol. We acquired rights to solriamfetol from Aerial in 2014, including Aerial’s patent rights relating to solriamfetol, other than in certain jurisdictions in Asia where SK retains rights. We have a portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications for solriamfetol relating to various compositions, formulations and methods of use. Three of our U.S. patents are method of use patents covering treatment of sleep-related conditions expiring between June 2026 and August 2027. A fourth U.S. patent covers the formulation of solriamfetol and expires in September 2037. We are entitled to apply for a patent term extension for one of these patents. 


• | JZP-258. We expect that certain patents and patent applications relating to Xyrem will cover our product candidate JZP-258. There are also five additional U.S. patents that will expire in January 2033 covering the formulation and method of making for JZP-258. 

We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our products and commercial position, particularly with respect to our products with limited or no patent protection, such as Erwinaze. 
14

In addition, we have a number of trademarks and service marks, and pending trademark and service mark applications, in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world to further protect the proprietary position of our products. For further discussion of the challenges we face in obtaining or maintaining patent and/or trade secret protection, see the risk factors under the heading “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
Government Regulation
As a global pharmaceutical company, our activities are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., the EU and other countries where we do business. Regulatory requirements encompass the entire life cycle of pharmaceutical products, from research and development activities to marketing approval, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event and safety reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, pricing and reimbursement, recordkeeping, distribution, importing and exporting. Regulations differ from country to country and are constantly evolving. 
Testing and Approval of Pharmaceutical Products
We are not permitted to market a product in a country until we receive approval from the relevant regulatory authority, such as the FDA in the U.S. and the EC or the competent authorities of the EU member states. An application for marketing approval must contain information generated by the applicant, also called a sponsor, demonstrating the quality, safety and efficacy of the product candidate, including data from preclinical and clinical trials, proposed product packaging and labeling and information pertaining to product formulation and the manufacture and analytical testing of the API and the finished product. 
In the U.S., the FDA reviews and, if warranted, approves applications for marketing approval. The process for obtaining marketing approval in the U.S. for a drug or biologic product candidate generally includes:

• | conducting preclinical laboratory and animal testing and submitting the results to the FDA in an investigational new drug, or IND, application requesting approval to test the product candidate in human clinical trials;


• | conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in the desired indication;


• | submitting an NDA, supplemental NDA, or sNDA, or BLA, as appropriate, to the FDA seeking approval for a specific indication; and


• | completing inspections by the FDA of the facilities where the product candidate is manufactured, analyzed and stored to demonstrate compliance with cGMP and any requested FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data supporting the application.

Human clinical trials conducted before approval of a product generally proceed in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate in humans, the product candidate is typically tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and side effects associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with specific protocols, as well as FDA requirements related to conducting the trials and recording and reporting the results, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, to ensure that the resulting data are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA enforces good clinical practices through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites.
Once an NDA, sNDA or BLA has been compiled and submitted, the FDA performs an initial review before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA may refuse to file an application and/or request additional information before acceptance. Once accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the current goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA for a new molecular entity, the FDA has ten months from the filing decision in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and in certain circumstances, the PDUFA goal date may be extended. For example, in December 2018, the FDA determined that a submission we made during the course of discussions regarding draft labeling in solriamfetol constituted a major amendment to the NDA, resulting in a three-month extension of the PDUFA goal date to March 20, 2019. 
The FDA also has various programs, including Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy and Accelerated Approval (Subpart H and E), that are intended to expedite the process for reviewing certain applications and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints or restricted distribution. Generally, products may be eligible for one or more of these programs if they are intended for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, have potential to address unmet medical needs, or may provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. For example, the FDA granted Vyxeos 
15

Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations and also granted Priority Review with respect to our NDA for Vyxeos for the treatment of t-AML and AML-MRC that was approved in August 2017. In addition, a priority review voucher, or PRV, such as the PRV that we acquired in May 2018, may be used to obtain priority review by the FDA for one of our future regulatory submissions.
During its review of an application, the FDA evaluates whether the product demonstrates the required level of safety and efficacy for the indication for which approval is sought and also conducts the inspections and audits described above. The FDA may also refer an application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a non-binding recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. When the FDA completes its evaluation, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines what the FDA considers to be the deficiencies in the application and may indicate that substantial additional testing or information is required in order for the FDA to approve the product. If and when identified deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, or if the decision is reversed through an administrative appeal, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
Even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA’s interpretation of the data submitted in the application. For example, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require the sponsor to agree to certain post-marketing commitments, such as conducting Phase 4, or post-approval, clinical trials to gain additional safety data or to document a clinical benefit in the case of products approved under Accelerated Approval regulations. The FDA’s approval of the BLA for Erwinaze includes a number of post-marketing commitments related to the manufacture of Erwinaze. Several post-marketing commitments and requirements were also mandated by the FDA in connection with its approvals of Defitelio, including the requirement that we conduct a clinical trial to analyze the safety of defibrotide versus best supportive care in the prevention of VOD in adult and pediatric patients, and its approval of Vyxeos, including the requirement that we conduct a safety study to characterize infusion-related reactions in patients treated with Vyxeos and a clinical trial to determine dosing to minimize toxicity in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. 
 In addition, if the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks, a sponsor may be required to include a proposed REMS (either as part of the application or after approval), which may include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits; a plan for communication to healthcare providers; or conditions on the product’s prescribing or distribution referred to as elements to assure safe use. Xyrem is required to have a REMS. For more discussion regarding the Xyrem REMS, see the risk factors under the headings “The distribution and sale of Xyrem are subject to significant regulatory restrictions, including the requirements of a REMS, and these regulatory requirements subject us to risks and uncertainties, any of which could negatively impact sales of Xyrem” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
The EU and many individual countries have regulatory structures similar to the U.S. for conducting preclinical and clinical testing and applying for marketing approval or authorization, although specifics may vary widely from country to country. Clinical trials in the EU must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive, which may be replaced with the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation in 2019, and applicable good clinical practice standards. In the EU, there are several procedures for requesting marketing authorization which can be more efficient than applying for authorization on a country-by-country basis. There is a “centralized” procedure allowing submission of a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. If the EMA issues a positive opinion, the EC will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biotechnology-derived medicinal products, and optional for others. There is also a “decentralized” procedure allowing companies to file identical applications to several EU member states simultaneously for product candidates that have not yet been authorized in any EU member state and a “mutual recognition” procedure allowing companies that have a product already authorized in one EU member state to apply for that authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU member states. The UK’s planned withdrawal from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU, and the impact on the process for obtaining or maintaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the UK is unknown.
The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an application in the EU under the centralized procedure is 210 days, subject to certain exceptions. An initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years, with renewal subject to re-evaluation of the risk-benefit profile of the product. Once renewed, the authorization is usually valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. 
In the EU, if an applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the product under normal conditions of use cannot be provided due to certain specified objective and verifiable reasons, products may be granted marketing authorization “under exceptional circumstances”. A marketing authorization granted under exceptional 
16

circumstances is valid for five years, subject to an annual reassessment of conditions imposed by the EC. The marketing authorization in the EU for Defitelio was granted under exceptional circumstances because it was not possible to obtain complete information about the product due to the rarity of the disease and because ethical considerations prevented conducting a study directly comparing Defitelio with best supportive care or a placebo. As a result, the marketing authorization requires us to comply with a number of post-marketing obligations, including obligations relating to the manufacture of the drug substance and finished product, the submission of data concerning patients treated with the product collected through a third-party patient registry and the establishment of a multi-center, multinational and prospective observational patient registry to investigate the long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio during normal use. We are in the process of conducting the post-authorization study in the EU to provide further data on long-term safety, health outcomes and patterns of utilization of Defitelio in normal use. 
Similar to the use of REMS in the U.S. to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks, in the EU and other countries we may be required to agree to post-marketing obligations in the marketing authorization for our products, to include a patient package insert or a medication guide to provide information to consumers about the product’s risks and benefits, to implement a plan for communication to healthcare providers, and to impose restrictions on the product’s distribution. For example, the marketing authorization in the EU for Vyxeos requires us to comply with certain manufacturing-related post-approval commitments. 
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, modifying a REMS, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further regulatory review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the new intended use. Such regulatory reviews can result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.
Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated, and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We and the third party suppliers of our products are subject to cGMP, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, recordkeeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA, the EC, the EMA, competent authorities of EU member states and other regulatory authorities. The FDA also periodically inspects manufacturing facilities and the sponsor’s and manufacturer’s records related to manufacturing, and assesses compliance with cGMP. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters. For example, the FDA issued a warning letter to PBL, our Erwinaze manufacturer, in January 2017 indicating that it was not satisfied with PBL’s responses to a Form 483 issued to PBL and citing significant violations of cGMP for finished pharmaceuticals and significant deviations from cGMP for APIs. As recently as August 2018, the FDA conducted an inspection of the PBL manufacturing facility and issued an FDA Form 483 to PBL citing observations related to items referenced in the existing warning letter as well as other manufacturing practices, including data and records management. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements may result in suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, withdrawal of the product from the market, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, among other enforcement remedies both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. countries.
In the EU, a manufacturing authorization is required to manufacture medicinal products, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing products and their APIs, including APIs manufactured outside of the EU with the intention of importing them into the EU. In this regard, in the UK, where PBL’s manufacturing facilities are located, PBL is subject to inspections conducted by the MHRA. Following a site inspection of PBL by the MHRA in December 2017, MHRA issued an inspection report listing several major findings, including major deficiencies and failures by PBL to comply with cGMP. In addition to inspection reports, manufacturers and marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in cases of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to manufacturing.
Sales and Marketing of Pharmaceutical Products 
Advertising and Promotional Activities
The FDA regulates advertising and promotional activities for products in the U.S., requiring advertising, promotional materials and labeling to be truthful and not misleading, and products to be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA actively investigates allegations of off-label promotion in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. The FDA routinely issues informal and more formal communications such as untitled letters or warning letters interpreting its authority over these matters. While such communications may not be considered final agency decisions, many companies may decide not to contest the agency’s 
17

interpretations so as to avoid disputes with the FDA, even if they believe the claims they were making to be truthful, not misleading and otherwise lawful. 
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Other applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including laws that prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products and further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and to health care professionals. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. 
Anti-Fraud and Abuse
We are also subject to numerous anti-fraud and abuse laws and regulations globally. In the U.S., there are a variety of federal and state laws restricting certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Our sales, marketing, patient support and medical activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. The U.S. federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value to induce (or in return for) the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute may be punished by civil and criminal fines, imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The government may assert that a claim resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution and administrative sanction, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and are subject to regulatory revision or changes in interpretation by the U.S Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG. Practices or arrangements that involve remuneration may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of themselves and the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Violations of the False Claims Act may result in significant financial penalties (on a per claim or statement basis), treble damages and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to other federal false claim and statements laws, some of which extend to non-government health benefit programs. For example, the healthcare fraud provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA, impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third party payors, or falsifying or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. The majority of individual states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and the False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
Other Post-Approval Pharmaceutical Product Regulation
Safety Reporting/Pharmacovigilance
The FDA, the EMA and other governmental authorities track information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. We are required to file periodic safety update reports with the authorities concerning adverse events. If, upon review, an authority determines that any events and/or reports indicate a trend or signal, they can require a change in a product label, restrict sales and marketing, require post-approval safety studies, require a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed products and ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits and/or require or conduct other actions, potentially including withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. For example, if the EMA has concerns that the risk-benefit profile of a product has changed, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be varied and requiring the marketing authorization holder to conduct 
18

post-authorization safety studies. The opinion is then submitted for approval by the EC. Also, from time to time, the FDA issues drug safety communications on its adverse event reporting system based on its review of reported adverse events. 
The FDA and the competent authorities of the EU member states on behalf of the EMA also periodically inspect our records related to safety reporting. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on FDA Form 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. An FDA Form 483 notice, if issued, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated relevant FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in a warning letter or other regulatory enforcement action. Similarly, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee may propose to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that the marketing authorization holder be required to take specific steps. Non-compliance in all cases can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
Sunshine Act and Transparency Laws
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires extensive tracking of payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests held by physicians and their families, and provides for reporting to the federal government and public disclosure of these data. Beginning in 2022, reporting will also be required of information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. A number of states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Government agencies and private entities may inquire about our marketing practices or pursue other enforcement activities based on the disclosures in those public reports. Other states restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to prescribers or engage in other marketing-related activities. 
Outside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the EU, is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU member states, as described below in “Business—Government Regulation—Anti-Corruption Legislation” in this Part I, Item 1. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Certain EU member states require that payments made to physicians be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Controlled Substance Regulations
A drug product approved by the FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA depending on the drug’s potential for abuse.  Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently “accepted medical use” in the U.S., lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the U.S. may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse. The active ingredient of Xyrem, sodium oxybate, is regulated by the DEA as a Schedule I controlled substance. Xyrem, as an FDA-approved drug product, is regulated as a Schedule III controlled substance. We expect that solriamfetol will be subject to scheduling under the CSA, which will need to be completed after any NDA approval and before commercial launch. Individual states also impose similar requirements for controlled substances.
The DEA limits the quantity of certain Schedule I controlled substances that may be manufactured and procured in the U.S. in any given calendar year through a quota system and, as a result, quotas from the DEA are required in order to manufacture and package sodium oxybate and Xyrem in the U.S. Accordingly, we require DEA quotas for Siegfried, our U.S.‑based sodium oxybate supplier, to procure sodium oxybate and for Patheon, our U.S.-based Xyrem supplier, to obtain the sodium oxybate from Siegfried in order to manufacture and supply us with Xyrem. Xyrem manufactured at our plant in Ireland enters the U.S. as a Schedule III drug and thus does not require a manufacturing quota.
As a Schedule III drug, Xyrem is also subject to DEA and state regulations relating to manufacturing, storage, distribution and physician prescription procedures, including limitations on prescription refills. In addition, the third parties who perform our clinical and commercial manufacturing, distribution, dispensing and clinical studies for Xyrem are required to maintain necessary DEA registrations and state licenses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations. 
19

Other Regulations
There are many other requirements and restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere imposed on pharmaceutical companies and their activities, including those related to the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes, the export and importation of products, required authorizations for distributors, the identification or licensing of sales representatives, restrictions on the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs, implementation of required compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct, protection of the environment, taxation and work safety. Non-compliance with such requirements may result in civil, criminal or administrative sanctions.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or the UK Bribery Act. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other countries generally prohibit the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to U.S. or non-U.S. government officials in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure an improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including UK and non-UK government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the UK Bribery Act, companies that carry on a business or part of a business in the UK may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including UK and non-UK government officials and private persons in any country, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. As described above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with government officials in many countries. Additionally, in certain countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and similar laws. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, private individuals who report to the SEC original information that leads to successful enforcement actions may be eligible for a monetary award. We engage in ongoing efforts designed to ensure our compliance with these laws, including due diligence, training, policies, procedures, and internal controls. However, there is no certainty that all employees and third party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors, and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of our suppliers and other third party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits. 
Data Protection and Privacy
We are also subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security is subject to increasing focus and continues to evolve. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, introduced new data protection requirements for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area, or EEA. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. Substantial fines may be imposed for violations of GDPR. In addition, certain EU member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, effective beginning January 2020, mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR. 
There are legal mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S., including the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. “Privacy Shield.” U.S.-based companies may certify compliance with the Privacy Shield principles or they may rely on other authorized mechanisms to transfer personal data. Certification for our U.S.-based subsidiaries under the Privacy Shield was approved in 2017. The EC, in its second annual review of the Privacy Shield, concluded that the U.S. continues to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred under the Privacy Shield. The U.S. Department of Commerce has strengthened the certification process and introduced new oversight procedures and will increase pressure on companies to comply with Privacy Shield. In addition, the privacy and data security landscape in the EU continues to remain in flux as the final decision on UK’s withdrawal from the EU may require organizations to revisit the way they transfer personal data from and to the UK. 
In the U.S., healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions that we collaborate with are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates or our agents 
20

knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
Marketing Exclusivity
The Hatch-Waxman Act
The marketing approval process described above for the U.S. is premised on the applicant being the owner of, or having obtained a right of reference to, all of the data required to prove the safety and effectiveness of a drug product. This type of marketing application, sometimes referred to as a “full” or “stand-alone” NDA, is governed by Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, which includes the results of preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in addition to other information. As an alternative, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides two abbreviated approval pathways for certain drug products.
The first path, under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, usually is used for the approval of a product that is similar, but not identical, to a previously-approved brand-name product, referred to as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Under this path, the applicant is permitted to rely to some degree on the FDA’s finding that the RLD is safe and effective and must submit its own product-specific data on safety and effectiveness only to the extent necessary to bridge the differences between the products. The second abbreviated path established under the Hatch-Waxman Act is for the approval of generic drugs. Section 505(j) of the FDCA permits the submission of an ANDA for a generic version of an approved, brand-name drug. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and the RLD (i) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (ii) are intended for the same uses, and (iii) are bioequivalent. This data and information are provided instead of data and information independently demonstrating the proposed generic product’s safety and effectiveness.
The Hatch-Waxman Act requires an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant to certify that there are no patents listed for that product in the Orange Book, or that for each Orange Book-listed patent either the listed patent has expired, the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. A certification that approval is sought after patent expiration is called a “Paragraph III Certification.” A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s Orange Book-listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a “Paragraph IV Certification.” If a relevant patent covers an approved method of use, an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant can also file a statement, called, in the case of an ANDA, a “section viii statement,” that the application does not seek approval of the method of use covered by the listed patent. With such a statement, the applicant must “carve out” the protected method of use (typically an indication and related material) from the proposed product’s labeling. If the applicant makes a Paragraph III Certification, the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA will not be approved until the listed patents claiming the RLD have expired. 
If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV Certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send a notice of that certification to the NDA holder and the relevant patent holders once the FDA accepts the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for filing. The NDA and patent holders then have 45 days to initiate a patent infringement lawsuit. Filing the lawsuit triggers an automatic stay on FDA’s approval of the ANDA or the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months after the NDA holder’s receipt of the notice of Paragraph IV Certification, expiration of the patent, certain settlements of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The FDA may issue tentative approval of an application if the application meets all conditions for approval but cannot receive effective approval because the 30-month stay or a period of regulatory exclusivity has not expired. If an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA is approved before conclusion of any relevant patent litigation, the applicant can choose to launch the product, but does so “at risk” of being liable for damages, and potentially treble damages, if the RLD sponsor or patent holder ultimately prevails in patent litigation.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from statutory periods of non-patent marketing exclusivity that can potentially delay review or approval of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning a drug containing an active moiety that the FDA has not previously approved. During this period, the FDA cannot accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for a product containing the same moiety, except that an application containing a Paragraph IV Certification may be submitted after four years, which may trigger the litigation and stay described above. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity with the approval of an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, for a product containing a previously-approved moiety but that incorporates a change (such as a new indication, dosage form or strength) from an approved product with the same moiety, if the change required clinical data from new investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity does not preclude submission of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA for such a product, but prevents the FDA from giving final approval to such product.
21

The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years (but not beyond 14 years from the date of approval) for an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, that is approved for a product that contains an active ingredient that has not previously been approved. The extension, which compensates for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of an NDA, and all of the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. It is available for only one patent for a given product, and it must be a patent that claims the product or a method of using or manufacturing the product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension. 
Orphan Drug and Other Exclusivities
Some jurisdictions, including the U.S., may designate drugs or biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the product and making it available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from U.S. sales of the product. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review process or lower the approval standards, but can provide important benefits, including consultation with the FDA. If a product is approved for its orphan designated use, it may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which blocks the FDA from approving for seven years any other application for a product that is the same drug for the same indication. If there is a previously-approved product that is the same drug for the same indication, orphan drug designation requires the sponsor to provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the approved product, whereas orphan drug exclusivity requires the sponsor to actually demonstrate clinical superiority. Clinical superiority can be by way of greater efficacy, greater safety, or making a major contribution to patient care. Additionally, a later product can be approved if the sponsor holding orphan drug exclusivity consents, or cannot adequately supply the market. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent approval of another sponsor’s application for different indications or uses of the same drug, or for different drugs for the same indication. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA to treat and prevent VOD until March 2023. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA for the treatment of AML until August 2024.
Biologic products approved under a BLA are subject to the BPCIA, which authorizes an abbreviated approval pathway for a biological product that is “biosimilar” to an already approved biologic, or reference product. The BPCIA provides periods of exclusivity that protect a reference product from competition by biosimilars. The FDA may not accept a biosimilar application for review until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the biosimilar cannot be licensed until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. We believe that Erwinaze, which was approved under a BLA in November 2011, is subject to an exclusivity period that will prevent approval of a biosimilar in the U.S. into November 2023.
Under certain circumstances, the exclusivity periods applicable to drugs and biologics and the patent-related protections applicable to drugs may be eligible for a six-month extension if the sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. This exclusivity may be granted even if the data does not support a pediatric indication. We will consider seeking pediatric exclusivity for our products whenever appropriate. For example, in response to a written request from the FDA, we conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of Xyrem in children and adolescents aged seven to 17 who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, and submitted study results in a supplement to the Xyrem NDA, seeking approval for this indication. In October 2018, FDA approved the sNDA and notified us that we had been granted pediatric exclusivity, extending by six months the preclusive effect of our Orange Book-listed patents for Xyrem that have not been invalidated, as well as the three-year regulatory exclusivity period granted to the Xyrem pediatric indication because of the clinical studies that were necessary for approval of the sNDA.
In the EU, orphan drug designation may be granted to products that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives. Orphan designated medicinal products are entitled to a range of benefits during the development and regulatory review process and ten years of market exclusivity in all EU member states upon approval. Similar to in the U.S., a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication may be approved, notwithstanding orphan product exclusivity, if the exclusivity holder gives consent or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Defibrotide has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to treat and prevent VOD, by the Commonwealth of Australia-Department of Health for the treatment of VOD and by the EC for the prevention of aGvHD. Vyxeos has been granted orphan drug designation by the EC until August 2028.

Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement by Government and Private Payors and Patient Access
Pricing and Reimbursement 
Successful commercialization of our products depends in significant part on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the U.S.), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third party payors decide which drugs will be reimbursed and establish reimbursement and co-pay levels and conditions for reimbursement. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services by examining their cost effectiveness, as demonstrated in pharmacoeconomic and/or clinical studies, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In some cases, for example, third party payors try to encourage the use of less expensive products, when available, through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement, co-pay and prior authorization policies. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may require prior approval before covering a specific product, or may require patients and health care providers to try other covered products first. Third party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. In many instances, third party payors now require rebates with some drug manufacturers in exchange for including a specific product on their formularies. In the past, we have not entered into such arrangements with third party payors for any of our products. The increasing pressure of the pharmaceutical coverage environment may lead us to do so in the future.
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low‑income and disabled beneficiaries. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government covering individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B pays physicians who administer our products. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicare Part B, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, several state Medicaid supplemental rebate programs and other governmental pricing programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. For the federal government to determine Medicare Part B payments to physicians, we are required to provide average sales price, or ASP, information for certain of our products to the CMS on a quarterly basis. The average sales price is calculated based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. This information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, with rates for Medicare Part B drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting and in the hospital outpatient setting consisting of ASP plus a specified percentage. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B program, or the 340B program, in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered drugs used in an outpatient setting. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. A new regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities became effective on January 1, 2019. HRSA also has announced that it will begin to implement a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B program during the first quarter of 2019. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting.
In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price to certain federal agencies that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP. The FCP is based on the non-
23

federal average manufacturer price, or Non-FAMP, which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts.
In addition, in the U.S., drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies is currently, and is expected to continue to be, under close scrutiny, including with respect to companies that have increased the price of products after acquiring those products from other companies. There are numerous ongoing efforts at the federal and state level seeking to indirectly or directly regulate drug prices to reduce overall healthcare costs using tools such as price ceilings, value-based pricing and increased transparency and disclosure obligations. The House Oversight Committee of the 116th Congress has announced an investigation into the actions of a number of pharmaceutical companies in raising prescription drug prices in the U.S. Several states have passed or are considering legislation that requires companies to report proprietary pricing information. For example, in 2017, California adopted a prescription drug price transparency state bill requiring advance notice and an explanation for price increases of certain drugs that exceed a specified threshold. Similar bills have been previously introduced at the federal level and additional legislation could be introduced this year.
 Similar to what is occurring in the U.S., political, economic and regulatory developments outside of the U.S. are also subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes and challenges. Pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels continue to exist. In various EU member states we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health technology assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU member states, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally compares attributes of individual medicinal products, as compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. On January 31, 2018, the EC adopted a proposal for an HTA regulation intended to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products. The proposal provides that EU member states will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social and ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 
In the EU, our products are marketed through various channels and within different legal frameworks. The making available or placing on the EU market of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited. However, the competent authorities of the EU member states may exceptionally and temporarily allow and reimburse the supply of such unauthorized products, either on a named patient basis or through a compassionate use process, to individual patients or a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. Such reimbursement may no longer be available if authorization for named patient or compassionate use programs expire or are terminated or if marketing authorization is granted for the product. In other EU member states, authorization and reimbursement policies may also delay commercialization of our products, or may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. After initial price and reimbursement approvals, reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels can be triggered by multiple factors, including reference pricing systems and publication of discounts by third party payors or authorities in other countries. In the EU, prices can be reduced further by parallel distribution and parallel trade, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU member states.
For more information, see the risk factors under the headings “Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably,” “The pricing of pharmaceutical products has come under increasing scrutiny as part of a global trend toward healthcare cost containment and resulting changes in healthcare law and policy may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition” and “If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. 
Patient Assistance Programs
We have various programs to help patients access our products, including patient assistance programs, which include co-pay coupons for certain of our products, services that help patients determine their insurance coverage for our products, and a free product program. We also make grants to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients with their premium, co-pay and co-insurance obligations. There has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance 
24

programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance, as well as reimbursement support offerings.
The OIG has established guidelines that permit pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations providing co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. In 2016 and 2017, we received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting documents related to our support of charitable organizations that provide financial assistance to Medicare patients. In April 2018, we reached an agreement in principle with the DOJ on a proposal for a civil settlement of potential claims by the DOJ in the amount of $57.0 million, subject to accrual of interest on the settlement amount from the date of the agreement in principle, negotiation of a definitive settlement agreement and other contingencies, which we expect will include entry into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG.

U.S. Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to together as the Healthcare Reform Act, was intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the “donut hole”), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the 340B program, fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
Since the November 2016 U.S. election, President Trump and the U.S. Congress have made numerous efforts to repeal or amend the Healthcare Reform Act. Such “repeal and replace” efforts have failed to date. However, additional legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the Healthcare Reform Act remain possible. In this regard, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. The nature and extent of any additional legislative or regulatory changes to the Healthcare Reform Act are uncertain at this time. 
Employees
As of February 19, 2019, we had approximately 1,360 employees worldwide. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Environment, Health and Safety
Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, in Italy and Ireland where we have manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of chemicals and solvents. Environmental and health and safety authorities in Italy and Ireland administer laws governing, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. In certain cases, such laws, directives and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of such contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us or at off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.
