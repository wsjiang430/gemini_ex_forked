--------+---------

Overview 
 Mastech Digital, Inc. (referred to in this report as Mastech Digital, Mastech, the Company, us, our or we) is a provider of Digital Transformation IT Services. The Company offers data management and analytics services; other digital transformation services around Salesforce.com and Digital Learning; and IT staffing services for both digital and mainstream technologies. Headquartered near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we have approximately 1,300 consultants that provide services across a broad spectrum of industry verticals. From 
 
1 


  July 1986 through September 2008, we conducted our business as subsidiaries of iGATE Corporation (iGATE). We do not sell, lease or otherwise market computer software or hardware, and essentially 100% of our revenue is derived from the sale of data and analytics, IT staffing and digital transformation services. 
 Our data and analytics services segment provides specialized capabilities in delivering data management and analytics services to customers globally. This business offers project-based consulting services in the areas of Master Data Management, Enterprise Data Integration, Big Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation, all of which can be delivered using onsite and offshore resources. 
 Our IT staffing segment combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of services in digital and mainstream technologies. Our digital technology stack includes data management and analytics, cloud, mobility, social and automation. Our mainstream technologies include business intelligence / data warehousing; web services; enterprise resource planning & customer resource management; and e-Business solutions. We work with businesses and institutions with significant IT-spend and recurring staffing needs. We also support smaller organizations with their project focused temporary IT staffing requirements. 
 Our digital transformation services include staffing and project-based services around Salesforce.com and Digital Learning. 
 Sales and marketing of our services are handled by separate and distinct sales organizations within each of our two operating segments. Our data and analytic services are marketed through 1) account executives who largely focus on new business development; and 2) technical relationship managers who focus on growing strong relationships within existing clients. Both account executives and technical relationship managers reside in either the U.S. or Canada. Our IT staffing and digital transformation services are conducted through account executives across the U.S. who deploy a telesales model, supplemented with client visits. This cost-effective model is aimed at integrator and other staffing clients, with a need to supplement their abilities to attract highly-qualified temporary IT personnel. Additionally, we use a branch service sales model in select geographies within the U.S. The branch services model employs local sales and recruitment resources, aimed at establishing strong relationships with both clients and candidates. We recruit through global recruitment centers located in the U.S. and India that deliver a full range of recruiting and sourcing services. Our centers employ approximately 200 recruiters and sourcers that focus on recruiting U.S.-based candidates to service a geographically diverse client base in the U.S. Our ability to respond to client requests from our offshore recruiting centers, with investment in sourcing and recruiting processes, expanded search coverage, round-the-clock sourcing, and frequent candidate contact, gives us the ability to deliver high-quality candidates to our clients in a timely fashion. 
 History and Developments 
 Historically, we operated as the former Professional Services segment of iGATE. Mastech Digital, Inc. was incorporated in Pennsylvania as a wholly-owned subsidiary of iGATE on June 6, 2008 in anticipation of our spin-off from iGATE. On September 30, 2008, we spun-off from iGATE and began operating as an independent public company. Our operating subsidiaries have 32 years of history as reliable providers of IT staffing services. 
 Established in 1986, our business model focused on importing global IT talent to the U.S. to meet the growing demand for IT professionals. In the early 2000s, the demand for IT professionals declined and the supply of IT resources quickly exceeded a declining demand curve. No longer was there a need to recruit abroad for technology talent, as supply was abundant in the U.S. Accordingly, we retooled our recruiting model to focus on the recruitment of local U.S.-based IT talent. Given our reputation with and knowledge of H1-B visas, part of our recruiting efforts focused on attracting H1-B visa holders currently in the U.S. This approach gave us access to a larger and differentiated recruiting pool when compared to many of our competitors.

 In 2003, we launched our offshore global recruitment center model in an effort to meet an increase in industry demand with lower cost recruiting resources. Over the last fifteen years, we have made significant investments in our offshore center to improve infrastructure, processes and effectiveness. Additionally, we have made investments in recent years in our domestic recruitment structure, primarily to support our branch service model. 
 During 2010, we made two strategic moves designed to enhance and expand our service offerings. In January 2010, we acquired Curastat, Inc., an Arizona-based specialized healthcare staffing organization. This acquisition, along with the creation of Mastech Healthcare, Inc., expanded our service offerings into the healthcare staffing space. Also in January 2010, we sold our brokerage staffing business, thus focusing on our IT and healthcare staffing operations. 
 In August 2013, we sold our healthcare staffing operations to focus entirely on our core IT staffing business. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2014, we established a technology center to evaluate practice opportunities for high-demand IT skill-sets and emerging technologies. In 2015, we embarked on our first technology practice, Salesforce.com. 
 On June 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Hudson Global Resources Management, Inc.s U.S. IT staffing business (Hudson IT). Hudson IT was a domestic IT staffing business with offices in Chicago, Boston, Tampa and Orlando. Hudson IT deployed a branch service business model that targeted clients that are direct end-users of IT staffing services. Additionally, as part of the Hudson IT acquisition, we acquired a digital learning services practice which became our second technology practice. 
 In 2016, we changed our name to Mastech Digital, Inc. The name change was part of our rebranding initiative that reflects our transformation into a digital technologies company. The rebranding also included a logo change and a refreshed corporate website. 
 In 2017, we added specialized capabilities in delivering data management and analytics services to a global customer-base through the acquisition of the services division of InfoTrellis, Inc. (InfoTrellis), a project-based consulting services company with specialized capabilities in data management and analytics. 
 In 2018, we expanded our Master Data Management and Big Data Services offerings within our Data and Analytics Services segment. 
 Recent Developments 
 On July 24, 2018, the Companys Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock. The Board determined that this action was in the best interest of the Company after a review of the Companys current financial position, business outlook and share trading patterns. The record date for the stock split was August 13, 2018. Shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date received one new share of common stock of the Company for every share that they owned on such date. The distribution of the new shares was made on August 24, 2018. The earnings per share calculations and share data for all periods presented have been recast to reflect the impact of the stock split on outstanding shares. 
Operating Segments 
 Our revenues are generated from two business segments: Data and Analytics Services and IT Staffing Services. Details related to these two businesses are discussed separately below, while information about our employees, differentiators, technologies and various other aspects of our business is shown in the aggregate for Mastech Digital, Inc.

 Data and Analytics Services 
 Our Data and Analytics Services segment is the result of our acquisition of the services business of InfoTrellis, Inc., a Canada-based organization with locations in Toronto, Canada, Austin, TX and Chennai, India. The acquisition was completed in July 2017, and the resulting business segment is marketed as Mastech InfoTrellis, a brand that combines the attributes of both Mastech Digital and InfoTrellis, Inc. This segment provides specialized capabilities in delivering data management and analytics services to customers globally. Our business offers project-based consulting services in the areas of Master Data Management, Enterprise Data Integration, Big Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation, all of which can be delivered using onsite and offshore resources. In 2018, we expanded our capabilities in Master Data Management and Big Data aimed at broadening our reach within these two important service offerings. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Marketing for Mastech InfoTrellis occurs in an integrated way, through a combination of pull-marketing and push-marketing methods. Pull-marketing occurs when content is generated in different forms and marketed digitally to the target groups encouraging inquiries from business prospects. Targeted webinars are also conducted on topics that are relevant to our customers business and may therefore result in potential business conversations. Outbound or push-based marketing occurs by circulating emails and placing telephone calls to business prospects, thereby soliciting inquires and striking conversations for new business development. 
 Mastech InfoTrellis business leaders, principals and sales personnel establish relationships with C-level executives and/or technology decision makers within client organizations. Being among the original thought leaders in the Master Data Management space, the executives of Mastech InfoTrellis are situated in an ideal position to solicit business through prospects key executives. 
 Our sales cycle usually commences once a prospective customer recognizes there is a challenge around its data management processes. Our sales team then collaborates with the principals in Mastech InfoTrellis and customizes a solution for the prospect. We provide a demonstration of a proposed solution to the prospective customer, after which the customer typically signs a master services agreement to implement the proposed solution. For those technology programs that we deliver, we generally invoice on a monthly basis or based on agreed-upon project milestones. 
 Projects are usually awarded on a time and material basis or on a fixed-cost basis. 
 Project Delivery 
 Mastech InfoTrellis project management is implemented using a Global Delivery Model that combines leadership, resourcing and execution across the U.S., Canada and India. All of the principals and sales personnel of Mastech InfoTrellis are based across the U.S., and Canada. The principals are key leaders at Mastech InfoTrellis who steer clients throughout the data management programs. Our principals have extensive experience in successfully delivering multiple data management projects to different business verticals. After a project commences, a delivery team is established to execute the program. This delivery team contains a blend of resources from North America and India. All projects follow our proprietary SMART Methodology.

The target clients are largely corporations with revenues exceeding $500 million. The average project value generally ranges between $500,000 to $3 million depending on the construction of the agreement. From a vertical perspective, customers in

  the financial services, retail, healthcare, manufacturing and government segments are significant users of our services. Below is a breakdown of customer revenue percentages for each industry vertical in 2018: 
 

Retail | 25% | Manufacturing | 16%
Financial Services | 22% | Government | 10%
Healthcare | 16% | Other | 11%

IT Staffing Services 
 In our IT Staffing Services business, we typically negotiate our business relationship by using one of three methods to gain agreement on the services to be provided. We either establish our relationship based on a simple standard term sheet; create a Statement of Work (SOW) specific to a project; or enter into a master service agreement with a client that describes the framework of our relationship. In each case, a client will submit to us positions and / or requirements that they plan on satisfying by using temporary contractors. We propose consultants to the client that we believe satisfy their needs and propose an hourly bill rate for each consultant submitted. The client will select our consultant or a competing firms consultant based on their view of quality, fit and pricing. Consultant specific contractual details, such as billable rates, are documented as an annex to the agreement type that is chosen by the client. While we have the ability to deliver our digital transformation services on a managed solutions basis, the majority of our assignments to date have been delivered as staffing assignments. 
 We generally do not enjoy exclusivity with respect to a clients contractor needs. Most of our clients use multiple suppliers to satisfy their requirements and to ensure a competitive environment. Our success with any particular client is determined by (a) the quality and fit of our consultant; (b) our ability to deliver a quality consultant on a timely basis; and (c) pricing considerations. We recognize revenue on contract staffing assignments as services are performed (hours worked multiplied by the negotiated hourly bill rate). We invoice our clients on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, in accordance with the terms of our agreement. Typical credit terms require our invoices to be paid within 30 to 45 days of receipt by the client. 
 While our primary focus is on contract IT staffing and digital transformation services, we also provide permanent placement services for our clients when opportunities arise. Permanent placement revenues have historically represented less than 1% of our total revenues. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We focus much of our marketing efforts on businesses and institutions with significant budgets and recurring IT staffing and digital transformation needs. We look to develop relationships with new clients. In addition, we work to penetrate our existing client relationships to deeper levels. Most of our strategic relationships are established at the vice president / sales director level. 
 Selling is conducted through account executives utilizing a sales model which is desirable to our clients needs. For clients with a need to supplement their own abilities to attract highly-qualified temporary IT personnel and prefer a low-touch sales model, such as integrator and staffing clients, we generally deploy a centralized telesales model, complemented with client visits. We supplement these domestic sales efforts through our sales organization in India, whose account executives target smaller IT staffing clients utilizing a cost-effective offshore telesales model. For end-user clients, who typically prefer a higher-touch sales model, we generally utilize a branch service model which deploys sales and recruitment resources locally, or regionally, in select geographies within the U.S. Account executives generally are responsible for a combination of new business development efforts and expanding existing client relationships. Account executives at our branch operations call on, and meet with, potential new customers and are also responsible for maintaining existing client relationships within their geographic territory. These account executives are paired with recruiters and both receive incentive compensation based on revenue generation activities using a localized sales and recruitment model.

 Many large end-users of IT staffing services retain a third party to provide vendor management services to centralize the consultant hiring process and reduce costs. Under this arrangement, the third-party managed service provider (MSP) retains control of the vendor selection and vendor evaluation process, which somewhat weakens the relationship built with the client. Our lower-cost centralized telesales model and highly efficient offshore recruiting model have better positioned us to respond to the growing use of MSPs. 
 Permanent placement activities are largely by-products of conducting our core contract staffing business. During 2018, permanent placement fees continued to represent less than 1% of total revenues. 
 Recruiting 
 We operate seven small recruiting centers located in the U.S. and one significantly larger facility in India that deliver a full range of recruiting and sourcing services. Our centers employ approximately 200 recruiters and sourcers that focus on recruiting U.S.-based candidates to service a geographically diverse client base in the U.S. Our ability to respond to client requests faster than the competition is critical for success in our industry as most staffing firms access the same candidate pool via job boards and websites. Our offshore recruiting capabilities, with investment in sourcing and recruiting processes, expanded search coverage, around-the-clock sourcing, and frequent candidate contact, gives us the ability to deliver high-quality candidates to our clients in a timely fashion. 
 We continue to invest in leading technologies and recruitment tools to enhance efficiencies. For example, we use artificial intelligence and web-based tools to expand the reach of our candidate searches. We also employ a state-of-the-art applicant tracking system that has recently been enhanced with proprietary tool-kits and job board / internet interfacing capabilities, resulting in further operational efficiencies. 
 In 2016, we closed our offshore recruitment office in Bangalore, India and concentrated all of our offshore recruitment efforts exclusively in NOIDA, a town near New Delhi. In late 2014, we significantly expanded our offshore recruitment offices in NOIDA which gave us the ability to nearly double our recruiter seats. This facility provides our offshore organization with state-of-the-art infrastructure and workforce amenities to attract top-quality recruiters and sourcers. This centralized offshore facility also affords us the ability to improve operational efficiencies compared to operating two offshore facilities. 
 We have access to a large and differentiated recruiting pool due to our brand recognition with both U.S. citizens and H1-B visa holders in the U.S. Unlike most staffing firms that have a high concentration of either H1-B workers or W-2 hourly U.S. citizens, we have historically maintained a balance of H1-B and W-2 hourly employees. We believe that this balanced mix allows us to access a broader candidate pool than our primary competition. 
 Technology Focus of our IT Staffing and Digital Transformation Services 
 Our staffing delivery teams, spread across the U.S. and India, are segmented by technologies, allowing us to reach deep and wide in our understanding of technology domains. The delivery teams work in an integrated manner to provide quality IT talent with a faster turnaround time than many of our competitors. We have long-standing engagements with marquee brands such as Saleforce.com, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Accenture PLC and other premier global enterprises across various industries. 
 IT StaffingDigital Technologies 
 Recognizing that a new breed of IT professionals, who are adept in digital technologies are in high demand, we enhanced our recruitment capabilities to focus on digital technology skill sets. Today, Mastech Digital provides its clients with the ability to secure skill sets that encompass social, mobile, analytics, cloud-based

  technologies and automation. IT staffing for digital technologies is growing much faster than mainstream technologies, a trend that is expected to continue into the future. Digital technologies include the following areas: 
 

 Social Analytics |  Data Engineering 
 Social Blogging |  Data Analytics 
 Social Campaign Management |  Decision Science 
 Enterprise Mobility Strategy |  Cloud Strategy 
 Mobile Application Development |  Cloud Implementation and Support 
 Artificial Intelligence |  Machine Learning 

 IT StaffingMainstream Technologies 
 A large part of our business today comes from IT staffing services around mainstream technologies. We provide services and have strategic relationships in many high-demand mainstream technology areas. Our IT professionals help design, develop, integrate, maintain and support mainstream technologies in the following areas: 
 

 Mainframes |  Open Source (JAVA) 
 Databases |  Data Warehousing 
 Middleware |  Microsoft (C, .NET, SQL) 
 Enterprise Systems |  IT administration 
 SoA and Web Services |  IT Helpdesk and Support 
 Verification and Validation |  Business Analysis 
 Project Management | 

Digital Transformation Services 
 Our Digital Transformation Services focus on providing solutions for CRM on the cloud through Salesforce.com and using digital methods to enhance organizational learning. 
 Salesforce.com: Mastech Digital has experience and exposure in building the most efficient roadmap for implementation, integration and upgrades of Salesforce.com solutions. Our expertise across the Salesforce.com product suite delivers value that contributes to the digital transformation of our clients enterprise-including deployment of Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Force.com based applications and integration with our mainstream and ERP systems. We were recently recognized as a registered consulting partner of Salesforce.com, lending more credibility to our practice. 
 Digital Learning Services: Our Digital Learning practice provides custom training programs for different organizational needs. With rich experience and proven success in handling several learning and performance engagements across industries, Mastech Digitals team combines digital and physical modes of learning methods to ensure unified organizational behavior and augmented performance across teams.

Our geographical concentration tends to track major client locations, such as California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida and Massachusetts, and in large metropolitan areas such as Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C.

  Below is a breakdown of our IT Staffing billable consultant base by industries that represented at least 4% of our billable consultants as of December 31, 2018: 
 

Financial Services | 44% | Government | 8% 
Telecom | 10% | Manufacturing | 4% 
Healthcare | 8% | Technology | 4% 
 | | Other | 22%

Mastech Digital, Inc. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,100 North American employees and 400 employees offshore, in addition to over 180 subcontracted professionals. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our Company. We employ our consultants on both an hourly and salary basis. A large portion of our salaried employees are H1-B visa holders. We enjoy a good reputation within the H1-B visa community, which allows us to access a very broad candidate pool. The majority of our hourly employees are U.S. citizens. On average, we maintain a balanced composition of salaried and hourly employees. We believe that our employee relations are good. 
Intellectual Property Rights 
 Our intellectual property consists primarily of proprietary processes; client, employee and candidate information; and proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We also own proprietary knowledge of the frameworks and products that we have built in our Mastech InfoTrellis business segment. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other arrangements to protect our intellectual property. 
Seasonality 
 Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation practices. Accordingly, we typically have lower utilization rates during the fourth quarter. Additionally, assignment completions tend to be higher near the end of the calendar year, which largely impacts our revenue and gross profit performance during the subsequent quarter. 
Our Competitive Position 
 We operate in highly competitive and fragmented industries, with largely low barriers to entry. In our data and analytics services segment, we primarily compete with IBM Services, Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services, Deloitte, Accenture, as well as with smaller boutique data and analytics firms, to a lesser extent. Many competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources in comparison to us. Our IT staffing services segment competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other staffing services firms and, to a lesser extent, temporary personnel agencies. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors for securing and building client relationships are driven by the ability to precisely comprehend client requirements and by providing highly-qualified personnel who are motivated to meet or exceed a clients expectations. We must be able to do this efficiently to provide speed to market with pricing that is competitive and represents value to our clients. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified personnel are compensation, availability, location and quality of projects and schedule flexibility. We believe that many of the professionals included in our database may also pursue other employment opportunities. Therefore, our responsiveness to the needs of these professionals is an important factor in our ability to be successful.

 Our Strengths 
 We believe our strengths compared to industry peers include: 
 Established client base 
 Our client base consists of large, medium-sized and small companies that span across multiple industry verticals. Long-standing relationships with corporate clients, blue-chip IT integrators and MSPs are a core component of our future growth strategy for our staffing business, while good relationships with customer influencers and decision makers drives our Mastech InfoTrellis business. These relationships, exemplified by our consistently low customer attrition rate, reflect our focus and commitment to our customers. 
 Operational excellence 
 In our data and analytics services business, our global delivery model is designed to ensure operational excellence by delivering higher value to our customers on project-based Mastech InfoTrellis engagements. Projects are delivered using our proprietary SMART Implementation Methodologya multi-phased approach based on parts of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and Agile development methodologies. 
 In the staffing services business, operational excellence largely relates to a firms ability to effectively recruit high quality talent. Our offshore recruitment operation gives us the ability to respond to clients staffing needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. Investments in sourcing and recruiting processes and leading technologies and recruitment tools have resulted in a highly scalable offshore recruiting model, which has delivered value to our clients. 
 Additionally, we employ a human resource management model, featuring portal technology as well as immigration support services, for our widely dispersed consultant base. This model enables us to maintain attrition rates that are much lower than the industry averages for our salaried workforce. 
 Minority-owned status 
 Our businesses benefit from the fact that we are a large minority-owned staffing firm. We have received multiple awards for our commitment to diversity. We have been certified as a minority-owned business by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC). This certification is attractive to many of our existing and potential clients, particularly in the government and public-sector segments, where project dollars are specifically earmarked for diversity spending. 
 Attractive financial profile 
 We have historically enjoyed a lower operating cost structure than our industry peers due to our low cost telesales in our IT Staffing Services segment and our offshore delivery models in both of our operating segments. These business models are cost-effective and allow us to quickly adjust our costs to changes in our business environment. Our blue-chip client base has ensured high quality accounts receivable and a strong and predictable cash flow conversion metric. 
 Expertise in high-demand digital transformation IT skills 
 We have substantial expertise in certain advanced technology IT skills including: cloud, mobile, data & analytics, social media, artificial intelligence/machine learning; Salesforce.com; and digital learning. We also have the capacity to take advantage of demand growth in these sectors, as we are well positioned in terms of scale, technical capabilities, and client base.

 Experienced management team 
 Our management team, comprised of business leaders with deep industry experience, is a unique blend of executives with significant Mastech Digital experience and others who have held leadership roles in other companies. We believe this talent, together with combined experience across a variety of industries, allows us to capitalize on the positives of our existing business models and, at the same time, improve our service offerings, internal processes and long-term strategy for future growth. 
 Business leaders of our data and analytics services business were part of the original thought leaders in Master Data Management space, which lends significant credibility to this segments service offerings. 
 Reportable Financial Segments 
 The Company has two reportable segments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Refer to Note 17 Business Segments and Geographic Information to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for information about our two reportable segments. 
Government Regulation 
 We recruit IT professionals on a global basis from time to time and, therefore, must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 37% of our workforce were working under Mastech Digital sponsored H1-B temporary work permits. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year. Legislation could be enacted limiting H1-B visa holders employment with staffing companies. In recent years, the vast majority of our H1-B hires were not subject to the annual quota limiting H1-B visas because they were already in the U.S. under H1-B visa status with other employers. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and may consider in the future, extensive changes to U.S. immigration laws regarding the admission of high-skilled temporary and permanent workers. Such changes, if enacted, may impact the types of H1-B temporary work permits that may be granted or the number of available H1-B temporary work permits, which in turn may have a negative impact on our revenues and profits.
