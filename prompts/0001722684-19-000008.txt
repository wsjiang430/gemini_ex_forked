Item 1. Business.
OUR BUSINESS
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Wyndham Hotels”, the “Company”, or “we”) is the world’s largest hotel franchisor, with nearly 9,200 affiliated hotels located in over 80 countries. We license our 20 renowned hotel brands to franchisees, who pay us royalty and other fees to use our brands and services. We are the leader in the economy and midscale segments and have a growing presence in the upscale segment of the global hotel industry. We have grown our franchised hotel portfolio over time both organically and through acquisitions, and we have a robust pipeline of hotel owners and developers who have executed franchise agreements for our brands. Wyndham Hotels became an independent public company in May 2018 when it was spun-off from Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“former Parent”). In 2018, Wyndham Hotels generated revenues of $1,868 million, net income of $162 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $507 million. (See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.)
We enable our franchisees, who range from sole proprietors to public real estate investment trusts, to optimize their return on investment. We drive guest reservations to our franchisees’ properties through strong brand awareness among consumers and businesses, our global reservation system, our award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program and our national, local and global marketing campaigns. We establish brand standards, provide our franchisees with property-based operational training and turn-key technology solutions, and help reduce their costs by leveraging our scale. These capabilities enhance returns for our franchisees and therefore help us to attract and retain franchisees. With over 5,900 franchisees, we have built the largest network of franchisees of any global hotel company.
Our portfolio of global brands enables us to franchise hotels in virtually any market at a range of price points, catering to both our guests’ and franchisees’ preferences. We welcome over 150 million guests annually worldwide. We primarily target economy and midscale guests, as they represent the largest demographic in the United States and around the world. We have

the leading position in the economy and midscale segments of the hotel industry, where our hotel brands represent approximately two of every five branded rooms in the United States. Approximately 70% of the hotels affiliated with our brands are located in the United States and approximately 30% are located internationally. The following table summarizes our brand portfolio as of December 31, 2018:
Our business model is asset-light, as we generally receive a percentage of each franchised hotel’s room revenues but do not own the underlying properties. Our business is adaptable to changing economic environments due to a low operating cost structure, which, together with our recurring fee streams and limited capital expenditures, yields attractive margins and predictable cash flows. Our franchise agreements are typically 10 to 20 years in length, providing significant visibility into future cash flows. Under these agreements, our franchisees pay us royalty fees and marketing and reservation fees, which are based on a percentage of their gross room revenues. We are required to spend marketing and reservation fees on marketing and reservation activities, enabling us to predictably match these expenses with an offsetting revenue stream on an annual basis. We also license the “Wyndham” trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property to Wyndham Destinations, Inc. (formerly known as Wyndham Worldwide Corporation) through a long-term license agreement under which we receive royalty fees. In addition to hotel franchising, we are a leading hotel management company. Our portfolio of managed hotels includes 438 third-party-owned properties and two owned properties. Virtually all of the hotels in our system are franchised to third parties, and substantially all of our Adjusted EBITDA is generated by our Hotel Franchising segment.
We pursue multiple avenues of growth to generate returns for our stockholders. We use our scale, brands, guest loyalty, franchisee network and sales capabilities to add new hotels to our system. Our long-established franchising experience and ability to innovate, together with favorable macroeconomic and lodging industry fundamentals, continue to support our organic growth around the world. Additionally, we intend to use our cash flow to continue to return capital to stockholders and to invest in the business and pursue external growth opportunities.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our success has been and will be driven by significant competitive strengths that we have developed over time:

Industry-leading footprint in the hotel industry
Wyndham Hotels is the world’s largest hotel franchisor, with nearly 9,200 affiliated hotels in over 80 countries as of December 31, 2018. Our brands have substantial presence, welcoming over 150 million guests annually worldwide. The following chart presents the number of branded hotels associated with each of the six largest hotel companies:
Global Hotel Companies by Number of Branded Hotels as of September 30, 2018
* As of June 30, 2018.
Source: Companies’ public disclosures.
Our scale enhances brand awareness among consumers and businesses and provides numerous benefits to franchisees. Our global reservation system, extensive distribution network and award-winning Wyndham Rewards program drive over 65 million guest reservations annually to our franchisees. We also help our franchisees reduce overall costs through our marketing campaigns, technology solutions and purchasing programs with third-party suppliers. Our ability to provide these benefits helps us to attract and retain franchisees.
Strong portfolio of well-known brands
We have assembled a portfolio of 20 well-known hotel brands, from leading economy and midscale brands such as Super 8, Days Inn and La Quinta to upscale brands such as Wyndham and Dolce. Our Super 8 brand, with over 2,800 affiliated hotels, has more hotel properties than any other hotel brand in the world. Our brands are located in primary, secondary and tertiary cities and are among the most recognized in the industry. Over 80% of the U.S. population lives within ten miles of one or more of our affiliated hotels. Furthermore, with the addition of the “by Wyndham” endorser, our brands now enjoy even higher awareness.
Our brands offer a breadth of options for franchisees and a wide range of price points and experiences for our guests, including members of our award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program. Our brands have also won numerous industry awards, both for guest satisfaction and as franchise opportunities for entrepreneurs. With many of our affiliated hotels located along major highways, our brands not only drive online and telephone reservations to hotels, they also help attract guests on a “walk-in” or direct-to-hotel basis.

Global leader in the economy and midscale segments
We have built a leading position in the economy and midscale segments of the hotel industry, with our brands representing approximately 40% of both U.S. economy and U.S. midscale hotel inventory. Our central reservation channels generate nearly half of our franchisees’ occupied room-nights annually and over 60% of guests at our franchised hotels in the United States. In addition, we have substantial experience in property design, hotel management training, establishing brand standards, advertising, structuring promotional offerings and online marketing for economy and midscale brands. Our economy and midscale brands are consistently highly ranked in J.D. Power’s North American Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index Study for those segments.
Our strength in the economy and midscale segments is attractive to potential franchisees and positions us well to benefit from favorable demographic and consumer demand trends. According to the Brookings Institution, just over 50 percent of the world’s population, or some 3.8 billion people, is considered part of the global middle class. As this population increasingly participates in the global travel and leisure industry, we expect the economy and midscale segments will be a natural entry point.
Award-winning loyalty program
Wyndham Rewards, our award-winning loyalty program, is a key component of our ongoing efforts to build consumer and franchisee engagement while driving more guest reservations directly to our affiliated hotels. Approximately 61 million people have enrolled in Wyndham Rewards since its inception, and substantially all 9,157 hotels affiliated with our hotel brands participate in the program. In addition, over 25,000 vacation ownership and rental properties participate in the program. Wyndham Rewards generates significant repeat business by rewarding frequent stays with points. Since being redesigned in 2015, Wyndham Rewards has been recognized as one of the simplest, most rewarding loyalty programs in the hotel industry, providing more value to members than any other program. It has won more than 60 awards, including “Best Hotel Loyalty Program” from US News & World Report, “Best Hotel Loyalty Program” in USA TODAY, “10 Best Readers’ Choice Awards”, “Most Rewarding Hotel Loyalty Program” from IdeaWorks and the #1 ranking on WalletHub’s list of “Best Hotel Rewards Programs” in 2018 for the fourth consecutive year.
Wyndham Rewards loyalty program members now account for approximately one-third of occupancy at our affiliated hotels. Total membership has been growing by over 10% annually for the past six years. Our franchisees benefit from the program through increased guest loyalty and the more than one million room-nights for which award points were redeemed for each of the past two years. These members are an important driver of our growth, as they spend nearly twice as much as non-members, on average.
Proven ability to create value through acquisitions
We have built our portfolio of renowned hotel brands primarily through acquisitions, beginning with the Howard Johnson brand and the U.S. franchise rights for the Ramada brand in 1990. Since then, we have acquired 16 economy, midscale, upscale and extended-stay brands, enabling us to meet travelers’ leisure and business travel needs across a wide range of price points, experiences and geographies. We have established an extensive track record of successfully integrating franchise systems and enhancing the performance of brands post-acquisition by leveraging our operating best practices, significant economies of scale, award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program and access to global distribution networks, while producing significant cost synergies for us and our franchisees. We intend to build upon our past success as we continue to opportunistically acquire and integrate brands into our franchising platform.
In addition, we have grown many of the franchise systems we have acquired to be significantly larger than at acquisition. For example, after acquiring the economy-focused Baymont Inn portfolio in 2006, we re-positioned the brand within the midscale segment as Baymont Inn & Suites by Wyndham and have more than tripled its size from 115 hotels to 513 hotels in North and Latin America. Similarly, we have doubled the size of our flagship Wyndham brand since we acquired it in 2005. We believe these capabilities, combined with our scale, enable us to be highly competitive for acquisition opportunities.
Strong and experienced management team
Our executive management team is focused on building upon Wyndham Hotels’ past success and track record of growth through its deep industry experience and leadership continuity. We benefit significantly from the experience of our executive officers, who have an average of 19 years of experience in the travel and hospitality industries. Our chief executive officer, Geoffrey Ballotti, spent 20 years with Starwood Hotels & Resorts before joining Wyndham Worldwide in 2008 and has been instrumental in transforming our business over the past several years through acquisitions and technology-related initiatives. 
5

Our non-executive chairman, Stephen Holmes, has 28 years of experience in the hospitality industry and served as Wyndham Worldwide’s chief executive officer from 2006 to 2018. Our chief financial officer, David Wyshner, has 19 years of experience in the travel industry and previously served as president and chief financial officer of Avis Budget Group. As a group, our executive officers have extensive experience with leading global hospitality and consumer-brand companies.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to be the world’s leading provider of select-service hotel brands by delivering the best value to owners and guests. We expect to achieve our goals by focusing on the following core strategic initiatives:
Attract, retain and develop franchisees
We intend to attract and retain franchisees and grow our system size by maintaining and increasing the value we provide to franchisees. With more than 5,900 franchisees, we have built the largest network of franchisees of any global hotel company. These hotel owners and developers provide the engine and platform for future growth. In order to attract, retain and serve franchisees, we plan to:

• | continually enhance the competitive position and awareness of our brands;


• | provide cost-effective new-construction and renovation prototypes to enhance owners’ returns;


• | offer best-in-class, cost-effective technology solutions; and


• | drive reservations to our franchisees through our proprietary booking and third-party distribution channels.

We are focused on building brand awareness, brand preference and reservations by presenting the value propositions of each of our hotel brands in all relevant channels to consumers who are likely to have the greatest propensity to stay with us. We provide value-engineered hotel designs and prototypes to property owners and developers to help them boost the returns they generate from their investments. We also provide our franchisees with fully integrated, turn-key property management, reservations and revenue management systems that have capabilities that were not previously affordable to hotels in the economy and midscale sectors. 
We continuously innovate in our e-commerce channels, including websites and mobile applications for our brands, to enhance the consumer experience and drive reservations to our franchisees. We also operate telephone reservation and customer service centers around the world, and provide easy access to third-party distribution channels for our franchisees. Finally, we develop strong, consultative relationships with our franchisees, beginning with the sales process, where we work with hotel owners to determine how our brands will optimize their investment. We nurture this relationship throughout the life of the contract, continually assessing our franchisees’ needs, providing solutions to meet those needs and partnering with them to grow their business. These efforts help us to retain approximately 94% of our total properties each year and to welcome an average of approximately two new hotels into our system every day.
Elevate the economy and midscale guest experience
We believe every type of traveler should have a great travel experience, regardless of price point. We are building on our leading positions in the economy and midscale hotel segments to reshape and elevate the economy and midscale hotel experience. This process starts with our iconic economy brands – Days Inn, Super 8, Howard Johnson and Travelodge – which we have redefined through new brand standards to offer a meaningfully enhanced guest experience. These changes enable our franchisees to create an upscale guest experience at an economy price point.
Our brands are among the most respected in the industry and have won numerous awards for the quality and consistency of service they provide. We intend to continue to drive favorable consumer perception of our brands through our brand standards, hotel management training, quality assurance, marketing and franchisee relations. As a result, we believe our reshaped and elevated economy and midscale brands will be a natural entry point for millennials and other price-conscious travelers, who are looking for quality branded experiences at an affordable price point.
Grow our footprint in new and existing international markets
With a diverse, global network of brands already represented in more than 80 countries, we intend to expand in new and existing international markets. Over the past five years, our international portfolio has grown at a compound annual rate of 9%, to nearly 2,800 hotels, and now represents approximately 30% of the hotels in our system.
6

We have built a strong, flexible international franchise sales platform, with more than 100 sales professionals in key locations around the world, including in Europe, Latin America, India, China, Singapore and the Middle East. We typically focus on rapidly developing countries that are under-served by the hotel industry. We also look for flagship opportunities in higher-traffic markets throughout the world to aid international brand awareness and loyalty. We believe our flexibility as a sales organization and our diverse portfolio of brands enable us to effectively adapt our sales strategies in response to franchisees’ and hotel developers’ needs, and to changes in global supply and demand.
Currently, our pipeline of executed franchise contracts and applications consists of over 1,400 hotels with nearly 180,000 rooms, of which more than half are international. As we grow internationally, we are particularly focused on brand quality and property design, with approximately 90% of our existing international pipeline being new-construction projects.
Use cash flow to create value for stockholders
We intend to use the cash flow generated by our operations to create value for stockholders. Our asset-light business model, with low fixed costs and stable, recurring franchise fee revenue, generates attractive margins and cash flow. In addition to investments in the business, including acquisitions of brands and businesses that would expand our presence and capabilities in the lodging industry, we expect to return capital to our stockholders through dividends and/or share repurchases. We expect to pay a regular dividend and use excess cash to repurchase shares.
Recent Developments
Our Spin-off
On May 31, 2018, Wyndham Hotels became an independent, public company when it was spun-off from Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, its former parent, which is now known as Wyndham Destinations. Wyndham Hotels’ common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “WH”.
In conjunction with the spin-off, we entered into agreements with Wyndham Destinations governing the terms of our separation, providing for certain transition services to be provided by each company to the other, and granting a 100-year license to Wyndham Destinations for the use of the “Wyndham” trademark in exchange for license fees payable to Wyndham Hotels. Wyndham Destinations is the world’s largest vacation ownership and exchange company with 220 vacation ownership resorts and over 4,300 affiliated exchange properties. (See “Relationship with Wyndham Destinations.”)
The La Quinta Acquisition
On May 30, 2018, we completed the previously announced acquisition of La Quinta Holdings Inc.’s hotel franchising and hotel management business (“La Quinta”) for $1.95 billion in cash. 
In addition to adding over 900 hotels to the world’s largest hotel network, the acquisition of La Quinta strengthened our position in the midscale and upper midscale segments of the hotel industry, which has been and continues to be one of our strategic priorities. Following the La Quinta acquisition, Wyndham Hotels franchises the largest number of midscale and economy hotels in the industry. In addition, for the first time in La Quinta's history, Smith Travel Research (“STR”) has moved the brand to their upper midscale from midscale segment of the industry. We expect to leverage our sales and development capabilities to further grow the La Quinta brand in the United States and across Latin America. The acquisition has expanded our managed hotel network by almost 280%, from 116 hotels just prior to the acquisition to 440 properties, making us the sixth-largest hotel manager in the United States. Hotel management represents an attractive expansion opportunity to grow our asset-light business and further penetrate the midscale and higher segments. 
The La Quinta Returns loyalty program, with over 8 million enrolled members, will be combined with the award-winning Wyndham Rewards loyalty program, with approximately 61 million enrolled members, in 2019.
We expect to generate substantial synergies when integrating La Quinta into our existing business by eliminating redundant public company expenses and reducing operating costs associated with technology, distribution and marketing as we leverage our scale and existing infrastructure. We anticipate that additional revenue benefits will come from incremental domestic and international expansion as well as RevPAR growth from a broader distribution platform.

Adding “By Wyndham” to Brands
In April 2018, Wyndham Hotels announced that it would be adding the “by Wyndham” hallmark to twelve of its brands: Super 8, Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Travelodge, AmericInn, Baymont, Ramada, Ramada Encore, Dolce, Dazzler, Esplendor and Trademark. Updated brand names and logos began appearing in April 2018. Additionally, in October 2018, we announced that we would be adding the “by Wyndham” hallmark to the La Quinta brand. We believe that the addition of “by Wyndham” cross-branding is boosting our, and our franchisees’, RevPAR performance and overall strength of our brands.
THE HOTEL INDUSTRY
Companies in the hotel industry typically operate through a combination of one or more of the following business models.
Franchise – Under the franchise model, a company typically grants the use of a brand name to a hotel owner in exchange for royalty fees, which are typically a percentage of gross room revenues, and provides marketing and reservation services for a fee, which is calculated similarly. Since the royalty fees are a recurring revenue stream and the related cost structure is relatively low, the franchise model often yields attractive margins and steady, predictable cash flows. Franchisors generally do not directly participate in the daily management or operation of franchised hotels.
Management – Under the management model, a company provides professional oversight and comprehensive operations support to hotel owners in exchange for base management fees, which are typically a percentage of total hotel revenue. A company can also earn incentive management fees which are tied to the financial performance of the hotel. In addition to management and incentive fees, typical management agreements include a provision that hotel owners will pay ongoing marketing and reservation fees, which are based on a percentage of gross room sales.
Ownership – Under the ownership model, a company owns a hotel and bears all financial risks and rewards relating to the hotel, including appreciation and depreciation in the value of the property. Ownership requires a substantial capital commitment and typically has a high fixed-cost structure.
The hotel industry, and hotel ownership in particular, is cyclical in nature. Companies operating under the franchise model are largely insulated from this risk when compared with the other two business models since they do not own the hotels and have limited operating costs. Therefore, a company’s strategic positioning and presence within these business models can influence overall profitability, particularly in a volatile economy.
According to STR, as of December 31, 2018, the global hotel market consisted of approximately 191,000 hotels with combined annual revenues of $540 billion. This represents over 17.6 million rooms, of which 54% are affiliated with a brand. The industry is geographically concentrated with the top 20 countries accounting for over 80% of total rooms. The United States has the largest presence in the global hotel industry with 5.2 million rooms, representing approximately 30% of the global market. China is the next largest concentration with 2.5 million rooms, representing approximately 14% of the global market. The geographical distribution as of December 31, 2018 was as follows:

Region | Hotels | Room Supply(millions) | | Revenues(billions) | BrandAffiliation
United States/Canada | 61,602 | | 5.7 | | $ | 177 | | 70 | %
Europe | 69,870 | | 4.8 | | 168 | | 40 | %

Midscale | 9% | Limited breakfast, selected business services 
Upper Midscale | 11% | Restaurants, vending, selected business services and some recreational facilities 
Upscale | 16% | Full range of on-property amenities and services, including restaurants, recreational facilities and business centers

History
Our business was initially incorporated as Hospitality Franchise Systems, Inc. in 1990 to acquire the Howard Johnson brand and the franchise rights to the Ramada brand in the United States. It was an integral part of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation and its predecessor from 1997 to 2018. Wyndham Hotels became an independent, public company in May 2018, when it was spun-off from Wyndham Worldwide. Our business has grown substantially over time through acquisitions and organic expansion.

Our System
With nearly 9,200 affiliated hotels in our brand portfolio, our global footprint is substantially greater than that of any other hotel company in the world. Our brands can be found in over 80 countries, with the heaviest geographic concentration in the United States and Greater China:

Latin America | | 215 | | 2 | %
Global | | 9,157 | | 100 | %

We welcome over 150 million guests annually worldwide. While our portfolio spans a wide array of hotel brand offerings, we are the leader in the economy and midscale segments of the hotel industry. 

 | # ofProperties | | % ofSystem

 | | 9,157 | | 100 | %

Our portfolio of brands appeals to a broad range of consumers. With diverse offerings across chain scales, geographies and price points, and a particular focus on economy and midscale hotels, we seek to address the travel needs of the over three billion people in the expanding global middle class. Our brands combine innovative design, quality and affordability that attracts today’s value-conscious consumer. While our typical guest is a leisure traveler, our industry-leading scale and presence in major, secondary and tertiary cities also attract business travelers. Many hotels affiliated with our brands are located on interstate and highway roadsides, catering to value-oriented guests seeking quality accommodations in convenient locations. We also seek to appeal to the growing millennial generation through our investment in consumer-facing technology, online and social media marketing, innovative new-construction prototypes and redesigned rooms and lobbies.
The following table presents the changes in our portfolio for the last three years:

 | As of December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016 
 | Properties | Rooms | | Properties | Rooms | Properties | | Rooms 
Beginning balance | 8,422 | | 728,200 | | 8,035 | | 697,600 | | 7,812 | 678,000

Ending balance | 9,157 | | 809,900 | | 8,422 | | 728,200 | | 8,035 | 697,600

In addition to our existing franchisees, we have a development pipeline of over 1,400 hotels, representing nearly 180,000 rooms as of December 31, 2018. Typically, about 80% of executions open within the following 24 months. While there can be no assurance that any particular property in our pipeline will eventually become franchised by us, our pipeline is typically only a subset of our development activity in any given period. Approximately half of our annual hotel additions are executed and opened in less than 90 days and therefore may never appear in our pipeline.
Our Brands
Through our diverse portfolio of well-recognized hotel brands, we offer consumers hotel options in markets throughout the world with a wide range of amenities and at a variety of price points.

Wyndham Rewards
Wyndham Rewards is our award-winning guest loyalty program that supports our brand portfolio and entire system of affiliated hotels. The program generates substantial repeat business for our franchisees by rewarding frequent stays with points that can be redeemed for free nights or other rewards, such as airline tickets and gift cards. Based on the principles of being a generous and simple program, loyalty members earn a minimum number of points for every qualified stay and are able to redeem a free night at any of our affiliated hotels for a fixed number of points. In addition to the 9,157 hotels in our system, Wyndham Rewards members are able to redeem points in over 20,000 vacation ownership and rentals properties pursuant to agreements with Wyndham Destinations and affiliates of Wyndham Vacation Rentals Europe.
Since inception, approximately 61 million people have enrolled in Wyndham Rewards. Wyndham Rewards members generated over 30% of our franchisees’ room-nights in 2018.
We license the Wyndham Rewards name to Visa in a co-branded credit card arrangement. Wyndham Rewards members who have the Wyndham Rewards Visa credit card benefit by earning points for purchases that can be used to redeem stays at any of our affiliated hotels, as well as certain other rewards. We generate revenue primarily by cardholder spending activity and the enrollment of new cardholders. Our Wyndham Rewards Visa credit card program has been growing rapidly, with cardholder spend activity up approximately 84% from 2014.

Our Hotel Franchising Business
We primarily license our brand names and associated trademarks to hotel owners under long-term franchise agreements. Our franchise agreements are typically 10 to 20 years in length and generally include a royalty fee of approximately 4% to 5% of gross room revenue and a marketing and reservation fee of approximately 3% to 5% of gross room revenue. Once a franchise agreement is executed, we will receive this cash flow stream throughout the term of the agreement. Our franchise business is adaptable to changing economic environments due to low operating cost structures and our ability to add affiliated hotels with little to no upfront capital investment by us. This, in addition to the recurring fee streams provided by royalty fees, results in a resilient business model that yields attractive margins and predictable cash flows and enables us to successfully manage industry fluctuations.
Early in our international development efforts, we entered new markets through master franchise agreements, whereby we licensed our hotel brands and our associated trademarks to third parties that assumed the principal role of franchisor. Since we provide limited services to master franchisors, the fees we receive in connection with these agreements are typically lower than the fees we receive under a direct franchising model. As our international presence expanded, our need to enter into master franchise agreements decreased, enabling us to transition to a more traditional direct franchise relationship.
Our franchise sales team consists of over 100 sales professionals serving customers throughout the world. Our sales team is focused on growing our franchise business through conversions of existing branded and independent hotels and partnering with developers to brand newly constructed hotels. Our franchise sales teams are generally responsible for selling all brands within a specified region and promoting the specific brand that is best suited for the specific property and location. In addition to a regional presence in the United States, we currently have development teams located in London, Istanbul, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore, Canada, Delhi, Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires. Our international presence in key countries allows us to quickly adapt to changes in the increasingly dynamic global marketplace and to capitalize on new opportunities throughout the world as they emerge. We occasionally provide financial support in the form of loans or development advances to help generate new business. In 2018, of the more than 1,000 new and renewal franchise agreements we executed, only 6% received financial support from us, totaling $27 million.
Our typical franchisee is a first-time hotelier and single property owner. Frequently, the hotel is our franchisee’s primary source of income. We offer these small business owners a variety of services, including (i) education and training on best practices in hotel operations, (ii) distribution, (iii) marketing and loyalty initiatives, (iv) low-cost procurement and (v) expansion and growth strategies, which help to drive return on their investment. We believe our ability to fulfill the needs of our franchisees is reflected in our franchisee retention, which is consistently high. We retain approximately 94% of our total properties each year.
A key element of our value proposition to franchisees is reservation delivery and profit optimization. Our cloud-based, web-enabled, state-of-the-art technology platform, which includes a fully integrated property management, reservation and revenue management system, is provided to our franchisees at an affordable price. We provide our franchisees with the types of tools used by larger hotels, a capability that was effectively unaffordable to hotels in the economy and midscale sectors. Our scale enables franchisees to take advantage of attractive pricing, and this cloud-based, web-enabled solution eliminates the need for our franchisees to purchase or maintain an on-site server, which traditionally has been a significant burden to hotel owners. 
Our reservation system is designed so that our franchisees have easy and fast access to incremental distribution channels. Using our fully automated and extensive partner network, we distribute rates and inventory through thousands of offline and online channels and connect to all major global distribution systems and online travel agencies, enabling our franchisees to leverage our scale to drive incremental bookings. We also offer around-the-clock handling of direct-to-property reservation calls for our franchisees. Our call center agents book reservations at a meaningful ADR premium as compared to direct-to-property reservation calls, enabling our franchisees to optimize revenue while reducing staffing costs.
As of December 31, 2018, our franchising portfolio, excluding managed properties, consisted of 8,717 hotels representing 742,800 rooms, which comprised 92% of our total system.
During 2018, we generated $1,135 million of revenue from franchising activities, which represented approximately 89% of our total revenue (excluding cost reimbursements). Our franchise fees include (i) ongoing royalties that are generally calculated as a percentage of gross room revenue and permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of the trademarks associated with our brand names, (ii) initial franchise fees, which relate to services provided to assist a franchised hotel to open under one of our brands, (iii) other franchise fees, which include franchise renewal fees, transfer fees and early termination fees, (iv) marketing, loyalty and reservation fees, which are intended to reimburse us for marketing and

reservation activities, as well as loyalty member redemptions and program administration and (v) royalties derived from licensing our “Wyndham” trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property to Wyndham Destinations.
Other revenues generated from franchising activities include licensing fees, credit card program revenue and procurement services. We earn revenue from a license, development and noncompetition agreement with Wyndham Destinations primarily for the use by Wyndham Destinations of our “Wyndham” trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property, for which Wyndham Destinations will pay us certain royalties and other fees. The term of the license agreement is 100 years. (See “Relationship with Wyndham Destinations.”) We earn revenue from our co-branded Wyndham Rewards Visa credit card program, which is primarily generated by cardholder spending activity and the enrollment of new cardholders. We also earn procurement services revenue from qualified vendors which is generated based on the level of goods and services purchased by franchisees and hotel guests from these qualified vendors.
Our Hotel Management Business
By providing management services, we are able to appeal to hotel owners who may lack hotel operating capabilities and want a single-source solution for brand and management. We make decisions to manage hotels based on the strategic value that doing so would add to our hotel brands, concentrating on brand and market location and the operating experience of the hotel owner. Internationally, particularly in developing markets, offering management services to hotel owners and developers is a prerequisite to successfully expand our presence in a region. Under our management arrangements, we provide all the benefits of a franchising agreement and also conduct the day-to-day-operations of the hotel on behalf of the owner. For the majority of hotels that we manage, we are responsible for the hiring, training and supervision of all hotel associates.
The duration of our management agreements is typically 10 to 20 years. We earn a base management fee, which is based on a percentage of the hotel’s total revenue, and in some cases we earn an incentive fee, which is based on achieving performance metrics agreed upon with hotel owners. As of December 31, 2018, we had 438 hotels under management contracts and two owned hotels – the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa in Puerto Rico and the Wyndham Grand Orlando Bonnet Creek. We manage hotels primarily under the Wyndham, Wyndham Grand, La Quinta, Dolce, TRYP, Hawthorn, Wingate, Ramada, Esplendor and Dazzler brands in major markets and resort destinations globally.
Our development team is focused on growing our presence in top U.S. markets with properties and hotel owners who will raise the profile and performance of our hotel brands, which will better position us to win future franchise and management contracts under our hotel brands. Our international development efforts are focused on building scale in key cities and markets, improving our hotel brand recognition and broadening our appeal to domestic and international guests.
During 2018, we generated $140 million of revenue from our hotel management business excluding $586 million of cost reimbursements, which is 11% of our total revenue (excluding such cost reimbursements). Hotel management revenues are comprised of (i) base fees, which are typically a percentage of the total hotel revenues, (ii) incentive fees, which are typically a percentage of hotel profitability, and (iii) for our two owned hotels, gross room revenue, food and beverage services revenue and other amenity service revenue, such as from spa, casino and golf offerings. Other revenue sources generated from hotel management activities include service fees, which include fees derived from accounting, design, construction and purchasing services and technical assistance provided to managed hotels. We also record revenue for cost reimbursements. These are reimbursable payroll-related costs for operational employees and other reimbursable costs at certain of our managed hotels. These costs are funded by hotel owners but the accounting rules require us to report these fees on a gross basis as both revenue and expense. We do not mark up these costs, and as such, the revenue and related expense have no impact on our operating income or net income.
Competition
We encounter competition among hotel franchisors and lodging operators. We believe franchisees make decisions based principally upon the perceived value and quality of the brand and the services offered. We further believe that the perceived value of a brand name is partially a function of the success of the existing hotels franchised under the brand.
The ability of an individual franchisee to compete may be affected by the location and quality of its property, the number of competitors in the vicinity, community reputation and other factors. A franchisee’s success may also be affected by general, regional and local economic conditions. The potential effect of these conditions on our performance is substantially reduced by virtue of the diverse locations of our affiliated hotels and by the scale of our base. Our system is dispersed among approximately 5,900 franchisees, which reduces our exposure to any one franchisee. One master franchisor in China accounts for 13% of our hotels. Apart from this relationship, no one franchisee accounts for more than 4% of our hotels.

Relationship with Wyndham Destinations
We maintain a significant relationship with Wyndham Destinations, which operates the world’s largest vacation ownership and vacation exchange businesses. Wyndham Hotels continues to own the trademarks and other intellectual property rights related to our hotel brands, including the “Wyndham” trademark, and collects a royalty from Wyndham Destinations for use of the “Wyndham” trademark, “The Registry Collection” trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property, under a long-term license, development and noncompetition agreement. Under a Transition Services Agreement, Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Hotels provide transitional services to each other for, among other things, finance, information technology, human resources, payroll, tax and other services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following our spin-off. Under a Marketing Services Agreement, Wyndham Hotels provides certain marketing-related services to Wyndham Destinations, including sharing certain post-stay reservation data and Wyndham Rewards loyalty program data for marketing purposes and providing telephone and email marketing support services. Additionally, Wyndham Hotels and Wyndham Destinations entered into agreements relating to participation in the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program and the co-branded Wyndham Rewards Visa credit card program.
Seasonality
While the hotel industry is seasonal in nature, periods of higher revenues vary property-by-property and performance is dependent on location and guest base. Based on historical performance, revenues from franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters due to increased leisure travel during the spring and summer months. The seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, earnings and profit margins. As we expand into new markets and geographical locations, we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past.
Intellectual Property
Wyndham Hotels owns the trademarks and other intellectual property rights related to our hotel brands, including the “Wyndham” trademark. We actively use, directly or through our licensees, these trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We operate in a highly competitive industry in which the trademarks and other intellectual property rights related to our hotel brands are very important to the marketing and sales of our services. We believe that our hotel brand names have come to represent high standards of quality, caring, service and value to our franchisees and guests. We register the trademarks that we own in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with other relevant authorities, where we deem appropriate, and otherwise seek to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights from unauthorized use as permitted by law.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. In particular, our franchisees are subject to the local laws and regulations in each country in which such hotels are operated, including employment laws and practices, privacy laws and tax laws, which may provide for tax rates that exceed those of the United States and which may provide that our foreign earnings are subject to withholding requirements or other restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy and other potentially adverse tax consequences. Our franchisees and other aspects of our business are also subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States.
The Federal Trade Commission, various states and other foreign jurisdictions regulate the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information prior to execution of a binding franchise agreement or payment of money by the prospective franchisee. State regulations also require franchisors to make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees, and a number of states also require registration of the franchise disclosure document prior to sale of any franchise within the state. Non-compliance with disclosure and registration laws can affect the timing of our ability to sell franchises in these jurisdictions. Additionally, laws in many states and foreign jurisdictions also govern the franchise relationship, such as imposing limits on a franchisor’s ability to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations has the potential to result in fines, injunctive relief, and/or payment of damages or restitution to individual franchisees or regulatory bodies, or negative publicity impairing our ability to sell franchises.
16

In addition, our business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to additional laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K.’s Bribery Act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 16,200 employees, including approximately 1,200 employees outside of the United States. Approximately 7% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our Company.
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies to our audited Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a description of claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business.
