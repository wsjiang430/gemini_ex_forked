ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (“CPRL”), together with its subsidiaries (“CP” or the “Company”), owns and operates a transcontinental freight railway in Canada and the United States (“U.S.”). CP provides rail and intermodal transportation services over a network of approximately 12,500 miles, serving the principal business centres of Canada from Montreal, Quebec, to Vancouver, British Columbia ("B.C."), and the U.S. Northeast and Midwest regions. CP’s railway network feeds directly into the U.S. heartland from the East and West coasts. Agreements with other carriers extend the Company's market reach east of Montreal in Canada, through the U.S. and into Mexico. CP transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. For additional information regarding CP's network and geographical locations, refer to Item 2. Properties. 
CPRL was incorporated on June 22, 2001, under the Canada Business Corporations Act and controls and owns all of the Common Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Company (“CPRC”), which was incorporated in 1881 by Letters Patent pursuant to an Act of the Parliament of Canada. CPRL's registered, executive and corporate head office is located at 7550 Ogden Dale Road S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2C 4X9. CPRL's Common Shares (the "Common Share") are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CP”.
For purposes of this report, all references herein to “CP”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to CPRL, CPRL and its subsidiaries, CPRL and one or more of its subsidiaries, or one or more of CPRL's subsidiaries, as the context may require. All references to currency amounts included in this annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, are in Canadian dollars unless specifically noted otherwise.
Strategy
CP is continuing the journey to become the best railway in North America, with a culture of responsibility and accountability focused on five key foundations:

• | Provide Service: Providing efficient and consistent transportation solutions for the Company’s customers. “Doing what we say we are going to do” is what drives CP in providing a reliable product with a lower cost operating model. Centralized planning aligned with local execution is bringing the Company closer to the customer and accelerating decision-making.


• | Control Costs: Controlling and removing unnecessary costs from the organization, eliminating bureaucracy and continuing to identify productivity enhancements are the keys to success.


• | Optimize Assets: Through longer and heavier trains, and improved asset utilization, the Company is moving increased volumes with fewer locomotives and cars while unlocking capacity for future growth potential.


• | Operate Safely: Each year, CP safely moves millions of carloads of freight across North America while ensuring the safety of our people and the communities through which we operate. Safety is never to be compromised. CP strives for continuous implementation of state-of-the-art safety technology, safety management systems, and safety culture with our employees to ensure safe, efficient operations across our network.


• | Develop People: CP recognizes that none of the other foundations can be achieved without its people. Every CP employee is a railroader and the Company has established a culture focused on a passion for service with integrity, in everything we do. Coaching and mentoring all employees into becoming leaders will help drive CP forward.

During the turnaround, CP transformed its operations by investing in the network and executing a precision scheduled railroading model that lowers costs, optimizes assets, and provides better, more competitive service. 
Today, we continue to apply our long-term strategy: leverage our lower cost base, network strengths and improved service to drive sustainable, profitable growth. While the accomplishments during the turnaround were tremendous, CP’s journey to become North America’s best-performing rail carrier is far from over. As a Company, we will remain focused on our next level of service, productivity, and innovation to continue to generate value for our customers and results for our shareholders. 
Business Developments
On October 19, 2018, CPRL announced a new normal course issuer bid ("NCIB"), commencing October 24, 2018, to purchase up to 5.68 million of Common Shares for cancellation before October 23, 2019.
Labour Disruptions - On April 18, 2018, CP received a 72-hour strike notice from the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference - Train & Engine (“TCRC”), representing approximately 3,000 conductors and locomotive engineers, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”), representing approximately 360 signal maintainers, of their respective plans to strike. At that time, CP commenced its work stoppage contingency plan to ensure a smooth, efficient and safe wind-down of operations.
   CP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT / 
On April 20, 2018, CP reached an agreement with TCRC and IBEW to have the Canadian Industrial Relations Board administer a ratification vote on each of CP’s final offers, which averted a potential work stoppage. The ratification votes occurred from May 18 to May 25, 2018 and both offers were voted down.
On May 26, 2018, CP received another 72-hour strike notice from TCRC and IBEW, and again CP commenced its work stoppage contingency plans. On May 29, 2018, CP reached a tentative three-year agreement with IBEW and averted strike action by its members. This agreement was ratified by the IBEW membership on June 29, 2018, with 78% of members voting for ratification. 
On May 30, 2018, CP reached a tentative four-year agreement with TCRC and ended strike action which began at 22:00 Eastern Standard Time on May 29, 2018. On July 20, 2018, this agreement was also ratified. The wind-down of operations and return to full service levels following the strike notices caused disruption to the network, losses in potential revenue and costs related to labour disruptions in the second quarter.
Change in Executive Officers 
On February 14, 2019, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. John Brooks to the position of Executive Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer ("CMO") from the position of Vice-President and CMO, and Mr. Chad Rolstad to the position of Vice-President, Human Resources from the position of Assistant Vice-President , Human Resources. 
On May 25, 2018, Mr. John Derry resigned from his position as Vice-President of Human Resources.
Change in Board of Directors
On December 17, 2018, CP announced that CP Board Chair, Andrew F. Reardon, will retire from CP's Board of Directors as of CP's 2019 Annual General Meeting on May 7, 2019. Isabelle Courville, a current member of the Board, has been designated by the Board as its next chair.
On September 25, 2018, the Company announced the appointment of Edward L. Monser to CP's Board of Directors effective December 17, 2018.
Operations
The Company operates in only one operating segment: rail transportation. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by business line, the overall financial and operational performance of the Company is analyzed as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. Additional information regarding the Company's business and operations, including revenue and financial information, and information by geographic location is presented in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 26 Segmented and geographic information.
Lines of Business
The Company transports bulk commodities, merchandise freight and intermodal traffic. Bulk commodities, which typically move in large volumes across long distances, include Grain, Coal, Potash, and Fertilizers and sulphur. Merchandise freight consists of industrial and consumer products, such as Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, Automotive and Forest products. Intermodal traffic consists largely of retail goods in overseas containers that can be transported by train, ship and truck and in domestic containers and trailers that can be moved by train and truck.

CP's Grain network is unique among railways in North America as it is strategically positioned in the heart of grain-producing regions of Western Canada and the Northern Plains of the U.S. Canadian grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, canola, durum, pulses and soybeans, and processed products such as oils, meals and malt. This business is centred in the Canadian Prairies (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba), with grain shipped primarily west to the Port of Vancouver, and east to the Port of Thunder Bay for export. Grain is also shipped to the U.S., to eastern Canada, and to Mexico for domestic consumption.
Canadian grain includes a division of business that is regulated by the Canadian government through the Canada Transportation Act (“CTA”). This regulated business is subject to a maximum revenue entitlement (“MRE”). Under this regulation, railways can set their own rates for individual movements. However, the MRE governs aggregate revenue earned by the railway based on a formula that factors in the total volumes, length of haul, average revenue per ton and inflationary adjustments. The regulation applies to western Canadian export grain shipments to the ports of Vancouver and Thunder Bay.
U.S. grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, corn, soybeans and durum, and processed products such as meals, oils and flour. This business is centred in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa. Grain destined for domestic consumption moves east via Chicago, to the U.S. Northeast or is interchanged with other carriers to the U.S. Pacific Northwest and U.S. Southeast. In partnership with other railways, CP also moves grain to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Gulf of Mexico. Export grain traffic is also shipped to ports at Superior and Duluth.

Dry fertilizers include: phosphate, urea, ammonium sulphate and nitrate. Wet fertilizers are primarily anhydrous ammonia. Roughly half of CP's fertilizer shipments originate from production facilities in Alberta, where abundant sources of natural gas and other chemicals provide feedstock for fertilizer production.
Most sulphur is produced in Alberta as a byproduct of processing sour natural gas, refining crude oil and upgrading bitumen produced in the Alberta oil sands. Sulphur is a raw material used primarily in the manufacturing of sulphuric acid, which is used most extensively in the production of phosphate fertilizers. Sulphuric acid is also a key ingredient in industrial processes ranging from smelting and nickel leaching to paper production.
MERCHANDISE
The Company’s Merchandise business represented approximately 37% of total Freight revenues in 2018.
The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Merchandise freight revenue by commodity business in 2018, 2017 and 2016:

Petroleum products consist of commodities such as liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG"), fuel oil, asphalt, gasoline, condensate (diluent) and lubricant oils. The majority of the Company’s western Canadian energy traffic originates in the Alberta Industrial Heartland, Canada's largest hydrocarbon processing region, and Saskatchewan. The Bakken formation region in Saskatchewan and North Dakota is another source of condensate, LPG and other refined petroleum. Interchanges with several rail interline partners gives the Company access to refineries and export facilities in the Pacific Northwest, Northeast U.S. and the Gulf Coast, as well as the Texas and Louisiana petrochemical corridor and port connections.
 / CP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Crude moves from production facilities throughout Alberta, Saskatchewan and North Dakota. CP provides efficient routes to refining markets in the Northeast U.S., the Gulf Coast and the West Coast through connections with our railway partners.
The Company’s chemical traffic includes products such as ethylene glycol, caustic soda, methanol, sulphuric acid, styrene and soda ash. These shipments originate from Alberta, the U.S. Midwest, the Gulf of Mexico and eastern Canada, and move to end markets in Canada, the U.S. and overseas.
CP's biofuels traffic originates mainly from facilities in the U.S. Midwest, shipping primarily to destinations in the northeastern U.S. 
The most commonly shipped plastics products are polyethylene and polypropylene. Almost half of the Company’s plastics traffic originates in central and northern Alberta and moves to various North American destinations.
Metals, Minerals and Consumer Products
The Company’s Metals, minerals and consumer products business represented approximately 30% of Merchandise revenues, which is 11% of total Freight revenues in 2018.

The majority of frac sand originates at mines located along the Company’s network in Wisconsin and moves to the Permian Basin, the Bakken, Marcellus Shale and other shale formations across North America.
CP transports steel in various forms from mills in Iowa, Ontario and Saskatchewan to a variety of industrial users. The Company carries base metals such as zinc, aluminum, lead and copper. CP also moves ores from mines to smelters and refineries for processing, and the processed metal to automobile and consumer products manufacturers.
Aggregate products include coarse particulate and composite materials such as cement, limestone, gravel, clay and gypsum. Cement accounts for the majority of aggregate traffic and is shipped directly from production facilities in Alberta, Iowa and Ontario to energy and construction projects in North Dakota, Alberta, Manitoba and the U.S. Midwest.
Food and consumer products traffic consists of a diverse mix of goods, including food products, railway equipment, building materials and waste products.

The following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Intermodal freight revenues generated from Canada, ports, cross border transportation, other international, and U.S. in 2018, 2017 and 2016:

2018 Intermodal Revenues (22% of Freight Revenues) | 2017 Intermodal Revenues (21% of Freight Revenues) | 2016 Intermodal Revenues (22% of Freight Revenues)

Domestic intermodal freight consists primarily of manufactured consumer products that are predominantly moved in 53-foot containers within North America. International intermodal freight moves in marine containers to and from ports and North American inland markets.
 / CP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

CP’s Domestic intermodal business moves goods from a broad spectrum of industries including retail, wholesale, less-than truckload, full-truckload, food, forest products and various other commodities. Key service factors in domestic intermodal include consistent on-time delivery, the ability to provide door-to-door service and the availability of value-added services. The majority of the Company’s Domestic intermodal business originates in Canada, where CP markets its services directly to retailers and manufacturers, providing complete door-to-door service and maintaining direct relationships with its customers. In the U.S., the Company’s service is delivered mainly through intermodal marketing companies ("IMC").
CP’s international intermodal business consists primarily of containerized traffic moving between the ports of Vancouver and Montreal and inland points across Canada and the U.S. Import traffic from the Port of Vancouver is mainly long-haul business destined for eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. CP works closely with the Port of Montreal, a major year-round East Coast gateway to Europe, to serve markets primarily in the U.S. Midwest and Canada. The Company’s U.S. Northeast service connects eastern Canada with the Port of New York, offering a competitive alternative to trucks.
Fuel Cost Adjustment Program
The short-term volatility in fuel prices may adversely or positively impact revenues. CP employs a fuel cost adjustment program designed to respond to fluctuations in fuel prices and help reduce volatility to changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues are earned on individual shipments and are based primarily on the price of On Highway Diesel. As such, fuel surcharge revenue is a function of freight volumes and fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues accounted for approximately 7% of the Company's Freight revenues in 2018. The Company is also subject to carbon taxation systems and levies in some jurisdictions in which it operates, the costs of which are passed on to the shipper. As such, fuel surcharge revenue includes carbon taxes and levy recoveries.
Non-freight Revenues
Non-freight revenues accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s Total revenues in 2018. Non-freight revenues are generated from leasing certain assets; other arrangements, including logistical services and contracts with passenger service operators; and switching fees.
Significant Customers
For each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no customer comprised more than 10% of Total revenues or accounts receivable.
Competition
The Company is subject to competition from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Price is only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transportation service provider. Service is another factor and requirement, both in terms of transit time and reliability, which vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location, access to markets and mode of available transportation. CP’s primary rail competitors are Canadian National Railway Company (“CN”), which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory in Canada, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC, including its primary subsidiary BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF”), which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory in the U.S. Midwest. Other railways also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railways and motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels.
Seasonality
Volumes and revenues from certain goods are stronger during different periods of the year. First-quarter revenues are typically lower mainly due to winter weather conditions, closure of the Great Lakes ports and reduced transportation of retail goods. Second and third quarter revenues generally improve compared to the first quarter, as fertilizer volumes are typically highest during the second quarter and demand for construction-related goods is generally highest in the third quarter. Revenues are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the transportation of grain after the harvest, fall fertilizer programs and increased demand for retail goods moved by rail. Operating income is also affected by seasonal fluctuations. Operating income is typically lowest in the first quarter, due to lower freight revenue and higher operating costs associated with winter conditions.
Government Regulation
The Company’s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules in both Canada and the U.S., which directly affect how operations and business activities are managed.
The Company’s Canadian operations are subject to economic and safety regulations. Economic regulatory oversight is provided by the Canadian Transportation Agency (“the Agency”) as delegated by the CTA, while safety regulatory oversight is primarily provided by Transport Canada (“TC”) pursuant to the Railway Safety Act (“RSA”). The CTA indirectly regulates rates by providing remedies for freight rates, including ancillary charges, remedies for level of service, long-haul interswitching rates and regulated interswitching rates in Canada. The CTA also regulates the MRE for the movement of export grain, construction and abandonment of railways, commuter and passenger access, and noise and vibration-related disputes. The RSA regulates safety-related aspects of railway operations in Canada, including the delegation of inspection, investigation and enforcement powers to TC. TC is also responsible for overseeing the transportation of dangerous goods as set out under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act (Canada) ("TDG").
The Company’s U.S. operations are similarly subject to economic and safety regulations. Economic regulatory oversight is provided by the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) which administers Title 49 of the United States Code and related Code of Federal Regulations. Safety regulatory oversight is exercised by the 
   CP 2018 ANNUAL REPORT / 
Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). The STB is an economic regulatory body with jurisdiction over railroad rate and service issues and proposed railroad mergers and other transactions. The FRA regulates safety-related aspects of the Company’s railway operations in the U.S. under the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as well as rail portions of other safety statutes. PHMSA regulates the safe transportation of all hazardous materials by rail.
Various other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company’s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental and other matters. 
Regulatory Change
After the tragic accident in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, in July 2013 involving a non-related short-line railway, the Government of Canada implemented several measures pursuant to the RSA and the TDG. These modifications implemented changes with respect to rules associated with securing unattended trains; the classification of crude being imported, handled, offered for transport or transported; and the provision of information to municipalities through which dangerous goods are transported by rail. The U.S. federal government has taken similar actions. These changes did not have a material impact on CP’s operating practices. 
On June 18, 2015, “An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act” received Royal Assent and is now in force. The legislation set out new minimum insurance requirements for federally regulated railways based on amounts of crude and toxic inhalation hazards ("TIH") or poisonous inhalation hazards moved. It also imposes strict liability; limits railway liability to the minimum insurance level; mandates the creation of a fund of $250 million paid for by a levy on crude shipments, to be utilized for damages beyond $1 billion (in respect of CP); allows railways and insurers to have existing rights to pursue other parties (subrogation); and prevents shifting liability to shippers from railways except through written agreement. As the implementation of various aspects of the amendments by the Government of Canada is still being completed, the Company is not yet able to determine their full impact.
On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Transportation Secretary announced the final rule for a new rail tank car standard for flammable liquids and the phase-out schedule for older tank cars used to transport flammable liquids. The development of the new tank car standard was done in coordination between Transport Canada, PHMSA and the FRA. This announcement was followed by publishing the new tank car standard and phase-out schedule in Canada on May 20, 2015. Canada has since issued two protective directions to advance phase-out dates. The first, Protective Direction 38, eliminated the ability to ship crude oil in legacy U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") 111 tank cars after November 1, 2016 (the phase-out date in the United States for these cars remained January 1, 2018). Protective Direction 39 was issued on September 19, 2018 and eliminated the ability to ship crude oil in unjacketed CPC 1232 tank cars after November 1, 2018, as well as certain condensates after January 1, 2019. The phase-out deadline for this car in the United States remains April 1, 2020. CP does not own any tank cars used for commercial transportation of hazardous commodities.
On October 29, 2015, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 ("STEA") was signed into law. The law extends, by three years, the deadline for the U.S. rail industry to implement Positive Train Control (“PTC”), a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments and other accidents caused by human error by determining the precise location, direction and speed of trains, warning train operators of potential problems, and taking immediate action if an operator does not respond. Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 2008 mandated that PTC systems be put into service by the end of 2015 on rail lines used to transport passengers or toxic-by-inhalation materials. The STEA extended the deadline to install and activate PTC to December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2020 under certain circumstances, allowing the Company additional time to ensure safe and effective implementation of PTC on its rail network.
For further details on the capital expenditures associated with compliance with the PTC regulatory mandate, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
On December 4, 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) was signed into law, representing the first long-term transportation legislation enacted in the U.S. in over a decade. The FAST Act contains key provisions on safety enhancements for tank cars moving flammable liquids in the U.S. and electronically controlled pneumatic ("ECP") train braking. Among those key provisions, the FAST Act requires new tank cars to be equipped with thermal blankets, requires all legacy DOT-111 tank cars moving flammable liquids to be upgraded to new retrofit standards (regardless of how many cars may be in a train) and sets minimum requirements for protection of certain valves. The FAST Act called for the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to re-evaluate its ECP final rule within one year using the results of this evaluation to determine whether ECP braking system requirements are justified. On December 4, 2017, the DOT found the ECP brake rule costs outweigh the benefits. On September 24, 2018, PHMSA officially repealed the ECP brake rule. 
The STB Reauthorization Act of 2015 was signed into law on December 18, 2015. The law requires numerous changes to the structure and composition of the STB, removing it from under the DOT and establishing the STB as an independent U.S. agency, as well as increasing STB Board membership from three to five members. Notably, the law vests in the STB certain limited enforcement powers, by authorizing it to investigate rail carrier violations on the STB Board’s own initiative. The law also requires the STB to establish a voluntary binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate and practice disputes.
Finally, on May 23, 2018, the Transportation Modernization Act received Royal Assent. The legislation amends the CTA and the RSA, among other Acts, to (1) replace the existing 160 kilometer extended interswitching limit and the competitive line rate provisions with a new long-haul interswitching regime; (2) modify the existing Level of Service remedy for shippers by instructing the Agency to determine, upon receipt of a complaint, if a railway company is fulfilling its common carrier obligation to the “highest level of service that is reasonable in the circumstances”; (3) allow the existing Service Level Agreement arbitration remedy to include the consideration of reciprocal financial penalties; (4) increase the threshold for summary Final Offer Arbitrations from $750,000 to $2 million; (5) bifurcate the Volume-Related Composite Price Index (“VRCPI”) component of the annual MRE determination for transportation of regulated grain, to encourage

hopper car investment by CP and CN; (6) mandate the installation of locomotive voice and video recorders ("LVVRs"), with statutory permission for random access by railway companies and Transport Canada to the LVVR data in order to proactively strengthen railway safety in Canada; and (7) compel railways to provide additional data to the federal government. 
Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Company’s operations and real estate assets are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to the air, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. If the Company is found to have violated such laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or operating results. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company’s operating results and reputation.
The Company has implemented an Environmental Management System to facilitate the reduction of environmental risk. Specific environmental programs are in place to address areas such as air emissions, wastewater, management of vegetation, chemicals and waste, storage tanks and fueling facilities. CP has also undertaken environmental impact assessments and risk assessments to identify, prevent and mitigate environmental risks. There is continued focus on preventing spills and other incidents that have a negative impact on the environment. There is an established Strategic Emergency Response Contractor network, and spill equipment kits are located across Canada and the U.S. to ensure a rapid and efficient response in the event of an environmental incident. In addition, emergency preparedness and response plans are regularly updated and tested.
The Company has developed an environmental audit program that comprehensively, systematically and regularly assesses the Company’s facilities for compliance with legal requirements and the Company’s policies for conformance to accepted industry standards. Included in this is a corrective action follow-up process and semi-annual review by senior management.
CP focuses on key strategies, identifying tactics and actions to support commitments to the community. The Company’s strategies include:

• | protecting the environment;


• | ensuring compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;


• | promoting awareness and training;


• | managing emergencies through preparedness; and


• | encouraging involvement, consultation and dialogue with communities along the Company’s lines.

Security
CP is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in Canada and the U.S. that address security concerns. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system. Rail lines, facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Regulations by the DOT and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. include speed restrictions, chain of custody and security measures, which can impact service and increase costs for the transportation of hazardous materials, especially TIH materials. Legislative changes in Canada to the TDG are expected to add new security regulatory requirements similar to those in the U.S. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of the Company’s current coverage could increase significantly, or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future. While CP will continue to work closely with Canadian and U.S. government agencies, future decisions by these agencies on security matters or decisions by the industry in response to security threats to the North American rail network could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or operating results.

CP takes the following security measures:

• | CP employs its own police service that works closely with communities and other law enforcement and government agencies to promote railway safety and infrastructure security. As a railway law enforcement agency, CP Police Services is headquartered in Calgary, with police officers assigned to over 25 field offices responsible for railway police operations in six Canadian provinces and 14 U.S. states. CP Police Services operates on the CP rail network as well as in areas where CP has non-railway operations.


• | CP’s Police Communication Centre (“PCC”) operates 24 hours a day. PCC receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials. PCC ensures that proper emergency responders are notified as well as governing bodies.


• | CP’s Security Management Plan is a comprehensive, risk-based plan modelled on and developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads post-September 11, 2001. Under this plan, CP routinely examines and prioritizes railway assets, physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and threats, as well as tests and revises measures to provide essential railway security. To address cyber security risks, CP implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. The Company has also worked diligently to establish backup sites to ensure a seamless transition in the event that the Company's operating systems are the target of a cyber-attack. By doing so, CP is able to maintain network fluidity. 


• | CP security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training, engagement with our customers and training of emergency responders.
