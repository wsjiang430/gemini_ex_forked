ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History

On September 19, 2011, we, Imagine Media, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, acquired approximately 52% of the outstanding shares of TransBiotec, Inc. (“TBT”), a California corporation, from TBT’s directors in exchange for 124,439 shares of our common stock. In January 2012, our Board of Directors amended our Certificate of Incorporation changing our name from Imagine Media, Ltd. to TransBiotec, Inc., and we acquired approximately 45% of the remaining outstanding shares of TBT in exchange for 109,979 shares of our common stock. With the acquisitions in September 2011 and January 2012 of TBT common stock, we own approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of TBT. As a result of the acquisitions, TBT’s business is our business, and, unless otherwise indicated, any references to “we” or “us” include the business and operations of TBT.

On March 9, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation and stockholders holding 52.24% of our then outstanding voting stock approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. The Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation was for the purpose of, among other things, changing our name from “TransBiotec, Inc.” to “SOBR Safe, Inc.” The Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation became effective with the State of Delaware on April 24, 2020.

At the open of market on April 28, 2022, our 1-for-3 reverse split of our common stock went effective with the OTC Markets. As a result, all common stock share amounts, as well as share amounts and exercise and conversion prices in derivative security instruments have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.

Pursuant to approval of an application with Nasdaq to up list our common stock to their exchange under the ticker symbol “SOBR,” our common stock began trading and quoted on the Nasdaq exchange on May 16, 2022. Prior to this up list to the Nasdaq exchange, our common stock was quoted on the “OTCQB” tier of the OTC Markets under the ticker symbol “SOBR.”

Our corporate offices are located at 6400 South Fiddlers Green Circle, Suite 1400, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111, telephone number (844) 762-7723.

Business Overview

General

We provide organizations with non-invasive technology to identify the presence of alcohol quickly and safely with its employees, contractors, participants or patients. These technologies are integrated within our robust and scalable data platform, producing statistical and measurable user and business data. Our mission is to save lives, increase productivity, create significant economic benefits and positively impact behavior. To that end, we developed the scalable, patent-pending SOBRsafe™ software platform for non-invasive alcohol detection and identity verification, a solution that has applications in probation management, fleet & facility, and for outpatient alcohol rehabilitation and youth drivers in a wearable form. We believe that uniform daily use of our device could result in material insurance savings across Workers’ Comp, general liability, umbrella and fleet policies.

We are now in commercial production and sale of our SOBRcheck™ solution. We have executed customer agreements and have had revenue since the first quarter 2022.

Our second device, a wearable wristband SOBRsure™, utilizes the same SOBRsafe™ hardware/software platform. The primary intended applications include probation management, fleet & facility, outpatient alcohol rehabilitation and youth drivers. The wearable band will be commercially available in the second quarter of 2023.

Design, manufacturing, quality testing and distribution for all SOBRsafe™ devices takes place in the United States.

SOBRcheck™

SOBRcheck™ is our stationary identification and alcohol monitoring product. When installed, SOBRcheck™ enables a rapid, hygienic biometric finger scan to authenticate ID and determine the presence or absence of alcohol. The SOBRcheck™ product provides the administrator with real-time results, delivered securely, to more efficiently manage their existing substance abuse policy. Our device is meant to be a specific point in time, quick test for the presence of alcohol, with the results to be used as a complementary data source in support of the organization’s alcohol policies. If alcohol is detected by the device, then our customers follow up in accordance with its own policies, which could include additional tests via a blood test or breathalyzer (we will not provide these devices). We will gather de-identified information regarding Pass/Fail tests for use in determining trends in a company and/or industry, etc. but such information does not include any specific data about the individual user, only whether a pass or fail result occurred. 

SOBRsure™

SOBRsure™ our transdermal, alcohol-detecting wearable band contains our SOBRsafe™ technology for ongoing, real-time alcohol monitoring and GPS tracking.

Our SOBRcheck™ revenue model consists of two components: a one-time hardware fee per device and a recurring monthly SaaS fee per user. We employ a similar model for the wearable band SOBRsure™: a one-time device purchase price and a monthly per user subscription fee.

We believe our device portfolio approach could yield a substantial repository of user data – a potentially monetizable asset for statistical analytics. The opportunity to collect data points over time could enable the development of business and insurance liability benchmarking, and through AI, powerful guidance for perpetual safety improvement (and associated cost savings capture). By demonstrating substance-free environments, employers could deliver a data-driven argument for lowering insurance premiums. We could potentially partner with insurance providers to mandate use of the SOBRsafe™ devices and/or technology.

The Substance Abuse Problem

Through criminal-justice related costs, lost work productivity and healthcare expenses, the annual cost of alcohol abuse in the U.S. is estimated to be $249 billion. Half of all industrial accidents involve alcohol, and commercial fleets suffer from over 11,000 alcohol-related accidents each year. We believe we have a solution that addresses this problem.
Competitive Advantages 

We are a leading provider of preventative transdermal (touch-based) alcohol detection systems in the U.S. market by seeking to proactively eliminate the presence of alcohol in zero-tolerance environments, and not simply punish the offender post-accident or other violation. We have entered the judicially-mandated market and most companies we consider to be our primary competitors, like SCRAM, BACTRACK, BI TAD, Soberlink, Smart Start, Intoxalock and others are primarily focused on breathalyzers for breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) measurement, or court-ordered ankle monitors. 

Our SOBRcheck™ device is a patent-pending, touch-based identity verification and alcohol detection solution. A user places two fingers on the device’s sensors: one compares biometric data points from the finger to confirm identity, while the other senses alcohol released through the pores of the fingertip. 

Marketing

We have developed a marketing plan that includes 1) alcohol detection/testing distributors, 2) direct sales, 3) trade shows, 4) popular and trade media public relations, 5) advocacy group alignment, 6) dynamic social media brand development and 7) continuous pursuit of cutting-edge detection technologies for future integration.

As of December 31, 2022 we have signed six customers and nine distributors.



Intellectual Property 

We currently have the following patent and patent applications related to our SOBRsafe™ system and related devices:


1) | U.S. Patent No. 9,296,298, titled “Alcohol detection system for vehicle driver testing with integral temperature compensation”, which expires in 2032.

Government Regulation

As we utilize a unique “Pass/Fail” methodology that simply alerts to the presence of alcohol (as opposed to measuring a discrete BrAC) – information that may be used at the discretion of the employer (or counselor, parent, etc.) – we do not believe we will be subject to any government regulation in the Facility & Fleet, Alcohol Rehabilitation or Young Driver markets. In the Judicial market, regulations vary significantly by state; some states only allow for the use of certain methodologies like breath or urine, while others do not specify and there exists no regulated barrier to entry for a transdermal solution. 
Employees

As of March 14, 2023, there are a total of 15 full time employees, including Chairman/CEO/Secretary David Gandini, CFO Jerry Wenzel, EVP and Chief Revenue Officer Michael Watson, and EVP of Operations Scott Bennett.
Human Capital Resources

The remainder of our workforce is consultants due to the nature of our business. As it relates to our employees and the consultants that work with us:
Oversight and Management

Our executive officers are tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning and talent management and development. We are committed to providing team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board regarding our human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including persons of color, veterans and LGBTQ+ to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We continue to invest in recruiting diverse talent.
Workplace Safety and Health

A vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. We focus on implementing change through workforce observation and feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes.

Importantly during 2022, our focus on providing a positive work environment on workplace safety enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. We took immediate action at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to enact rigorous safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site workforce through staggered schedules, remote working where possible and restricting visitor access to our locations. We believe these actions helped minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce.
