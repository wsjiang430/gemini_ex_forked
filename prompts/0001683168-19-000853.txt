ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” the “Company,” or “ARCA”) are in the business of recycling major household appliances in North America by providing turnkey appliance recycling and replacement services for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs through our subsidiaries ARCA Recycling, Inc. and ARCA Canada Inc.  In addition, through our GeoTraq Inc. (“GeoTraq”) subsidiary, we are engaged in the development, design and, ultimately, we expect the sale of, cellular transceiver modules and associated wireless services. Prior to December 30, 2017, we sold new and out-of-the-box major household appliances in the United States though a chain of Company-owned retail stores operating under the name ApplianceSmart®. On December 30, 2017, we, together with our then subsidiary ApplianceSmart, Inc. (“ApplianceSmart”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with ApplianceSmart Holdings LLC (the “Purchaser”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Live Ventures Incorporated (“Live”), pursuant to which we sold to the Purchaser all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the “ApplianceSmart Stock”) of ApplianceSmart in exchange for $6,500,000. Effective April 1, 2018, the Purchaser issued the Company a promissory note (the “ApplianceSmart Note”) with a three-year term in the original principal amount of $3,919,494 for the balance of the purchase price. ApplianceSmart is guaranteeing the repayment of the ApplianceSmart Note. On December 26, 2018, the ApplianceSmart Note was amended and restated to grant ARCA a security interest in the assets of the Purchaser, ApplianceSmart, and ApplianceSmart Contracting Inc. in exchange for modifying the repayment terms to provide for the payment in full of all accrued interest and principal on April 1, 2021, the maturity date of the ApplianceSmart Note. On March 15, 2019, the Company entered into subordination agreements with third parties pursuant to which it agreed to subordinate the payment of indebtedness under the ApplianceSmart Note and the Company’s security interest in the assets of ApplianceSmart and other related parties in exchange for up to $1,200,000 payable within 15 days of the agreement. In addition, we had a 50% interest in a joint venture, ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC (“AAP”), which recycled appliances in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, which we sold on August 15, 2017.
 
As a leading recycler of major household appliances, we generate revenues from:
 

1. | Fees charged for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Fees charged for recycling and replacing old appliances with new ENERGY STAR® appliances for energy efficiency programs sponsored by electric and gas utilities.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Sale of byproduct materials, such as metals, from appliances we recycle.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Sale of carbon offsets created by the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants acquired through various recycling programs.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Through December 30, 2017, we generated revenues from the retail sales of appliances at our ApplianceSmart stores.
 
Our GeoTraq subsidiary has not generated any revenue to date, including in the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.
 
We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1983, although through our predecessors we began our appliance retail and recycling business in 1976. On March 12, 2018, we reincorporated into the State of Nevada. Our principal office is located at 175 Jackson Avenue North, Suite 102, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55343-4565.

Improper disposal of old appliances threatens air, ground and water resources because many types of major appliances contain substances that can damage the environment. These harmful materials include:
 

1. | Mercury, which easily enters the body through absorption, inhalation or ingestion, potentially causing neurological damage. Mercury-containing components may be found in freezers, washers and ranges.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Chlorofluorocarbon (“CFC”), hydrochlorofluorocarbon, and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (collectively, “Refrigerants”), which cause long-term damage to the earth’s ozone layer and may contribute to global climate change. Refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners and dehumidifiers commonly contain Refrigerants. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | CFCs having a very high ozone-depletion potential that may also be used as blowing agents in the polyurethane foam insulation of refrigerators and freezers.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Other materials, such as oil, that are harmful when released into the environment.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The U.S. federal government requires the recovery of refrigerants upon appliance disposal and also regulates the management of hazardous materials found in appliances. Most state and local governments have also enacted laws affecting how their residents dispose of unwanted appliances. For example, many areas restrict landfills and scrap metal processors from accepting appliances unless the units have been processed to remove environmentally harmful materials.  As a result, old appliances usually cannot be discarded directly through ordinary solid waste systems.
 
In addition to these solid waste management and environmental issues, energy conservation is another compelling reason for proper disposal of old appliances. The U.S. Department of Energy’s updated appliance energy efficiency standards that took effect in September 2014 require new refrigerators to be 25 to 30 percent more efficient than those manufactured only one year earlier. Refrigerators manufactured today use about one-fifth as much electricity as units made in the mid-1970s.
 
While new refrigerators can save a significant amount of energy in the home, more than 30 percent of all U.S. households have a second refrigerator in the basement or garage. These units are typically 15-25 years old and consume about 750 to 1500 kilowatt-hours per year, driving electric bills up by more than $150 annually per household.
 
Utilities have become important participants in dealing with energy inefficient appliances as a way of reducing peak demand on their systems and avoiding the capital and environmental costs of adding new generating capacity. To encourage the permanent removal of energy inefficient appliances from use, many electric utility companies sponsor programs through which their residential customers can retire working refrigerators, freezers, and room air conditioners.  Utility companies often provide assistance and incentives for consumers to discontinue use of a surplus appliance or to replace their old, inefficient appliances with newer, more efficient models. To help accomplish this, some utilities offer appliance replacement programs for some segments of their customers, through which older model kitchen and laundry appliances are recycled and new highly efficient ENERGY STAR® units are installed.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has been supportive of efforts by electric utilities and other entities that sponsor appliance recycling programs to ensure that the collected units are managed in an environmentally sound manner. In October 2006, the EPA launched the Responsible Appliance Disposal (“RAD”) Program, a voluntary partnership program designed to help protect the ozone layer and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Through the program, RAD partners use best practices to recover ozone-depleting chemicals and other harmful materials from old refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners and dehumidifiers. Because of our appliance recycling expertise, we were active participants in helping to design the RAD program and currently submit annual reports to the EPA to document the environmental benefits our utility customers that are RAD partners have achieved through their recycling programs.
 
Technology
 
GeoTraq® is a technology company that designs innovative wireless modules to connect devices to the Mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”). The company’s modules contain location-based service (“LBS”) capabilities and can interface to external sensors to allow them to communicate both sensor status and position information. GeoTraq is planning to manufacture and sell wireless transceiver modules along with service subscriptions that will allow connectivity using publicly available global Mobile IoT networks. In addition, GeoTraq will operate a service platform that provides an Application Programmers Interface (“API”) to give customers and partners management of and access to all of their connected modules around the world using a single interface.

GeoTraq's solution addresses the large and growing Mobile IoT market segment that needs to communicate small packets of sensor and location information over a very large geographic area. For these “Simple IoT” solutions, the market is currently under served with existing solutions due to high deployment costs (hardware, service, logistics), limited battery life and large form factor.
 
We believe that there is a large under-served portion of the LBS market that is not addressed by existing solutions. RFID and Wi-Fi require close proximity for asset tracking, while GPS is too bulky and power hungry for many needs. GeoTraq addresses the white space in-between by designing wireless transceiver modules with technology that provides LBS directly from global Mobile IoT networks. GeoTraq’s technology allows for a substantially lower cost solution, extended service life, a small form factor and even disposable devices, which we believe can significantly reduce return logistics costs.
 
Company Background
 
Recycling
 
We started our business in 1976 as a used appliance retailer that reconditioned old appliances to sell in our stores.  Under contracts with national and regional retailers of new appliances, such as Sears and Montgomery Ward, we collected the replaced appliance from the retailer’s customer’s residence when one of their stores delivered a new appliance in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Miami or Atlanta market. Any old appliances that we could not sell in our stores were sold to scrap metal processors. In the late 1980s, stricter environmental regulations began to affect the disposal of unwanted appliances and we were no longer able to take appliances that contained hazardous components to a scrap metal processor. At that time, we began to develop systems and equipment to remove the harmful materials so that metal processors would accept the appliance shells for processing. We then offered our services for disposing of appliances in an environmentally sound manner to appliance manufacturers and retailers, waste hauling companies, rental property managers, local governments, and the public.
  
In 1989, we began contracting with electric utility companies to provide turnkey appliance recycling services to support their energy conservation efforts. Since that time, we have provided our services to approximately 400 utilities and other providers of energy efficiency programs throughout North America.
 
We currently have contracts to recycle, or to replace and recycle, appliances for approximately 180 utilities across North America.
 
We have seen continued interest from sponsors of energy efficiency initiatives that recognize the effectiveness of recycling and replacing energy inefficient appliances.  We are aggressively pursuing electric, water and gas utilities, public housing authorities, and energy efficiency management companies going forward and expect that we will continue to submit proposals for various new appliance recycling and replacement programs accordingly. However, for a variety of reasons, we still have a limited ability to project revenues from utility programs.  We cannot predict recycling volumes or if we will be successful in obtaining new contracts in the next fiscal year.
 
We operate eleven recycling centers in the U.S. and Canada to process and recycle old appliances according to all federal, state, provincial, and local rules and regulations. ARCA uses U.S. EPA RAD-compliant methods to remove and properly manage hazardous components and materials, including CFC refrigerants, mercury, polyurethane foam insulation and recyclable materials, such as ferrous and nonferrous metals, plastics and glass. All of our facilities comply with licensing and permitting requirements, and employees who process appliances receive extensive safety and hazardous materials training.
 
In October 2009, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) with 4301 Operations, LLC (“4301”) to establish and operate a regional processing center (“RPC”). At the time of the formation of this joint venture, we believed that 4301 had significant experience in the recycling of major household appliances and, in connection therewith, they contributed their then existing business and equipment to the joint venture. Under the Joint Venture Agreement, the parties formed a new entity known as ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC (“AAP”) in which each party had a 50% interest. In connection with the formation of the joint venture, we contributed $2.0 million to the joint venture. The joint venture commenced operations on February 8, 2010. On August 15, 2017, ARCA entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with 4301 and sold its 50% joint venture interest in AAP to 4301 in consideration of $800,000 in cash. The gain recorded by ARCA was $81,000

On the same date and in a separate related transaction, ARCA entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Recleim LLC and the parent company of Recleim PA, LLC. Under the agreement, ARCA agreed to license certain intellectual property under patent No. 8,931,289 to Recleim PA, LLC for use at 4301 North Delaware Avenue, Philadelphia, PA or any successor facility within 15 miles where Recleim PA, LLC conducts business. On August 15, 2017 Recleim PA, LLC (1) paid in full all AAP indebtedness owed to BB&T in the amount of $3,454,000, (2) terminated and released all security interests in AAP and ARCA’s equipment as part of Recleim PA LLC’s purchase of certain equipment and assets from AAP on the same date, and, (3) Recleim PA LLC assumed approximately $768,000 in AAP liabilities and all of ARCA’s liabilities to Haier US Appliance Solutions, Inc., dba GE Appliances (“GEA”).
 
GeoTraq
 
In a move to diversify our offering beyond our current appliance recycling capabilities, on August 18, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with GeoTraq pursuant to which we acquired GeoTraq by way of merger. As a result of this transaction, GeoTraq became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with this transaction, the Company tendered to the owners of GeoTraq $200,000, issued to them an aggregate of 288,588 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock valued at $14,963,288 inclusive of the beneficial conversion feature, and entered into one-year unsecured promissory notes for an aggregate original principal amount of $800,000. These unsecured promissory notes have been repaid in full. In addition, there was $10,133,366 deferred tax liability associated with the purchase of the intangible assets of GeoTraq. The total value of the intangible assets purchased is $26,096,654 including the deferred tax liability. See “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters – Beneficial Ownership of Series A Preferred Stock.”
 
GeoTraq is a Mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”) technology company that designs innovative wireless modules that provide Location Based Services (“LBS”) and connect external sensors to the IoT. GeoTraq is planning to manufacture and sell wireless transceiver modules and subscription services that will allow connectivity using publicly available global Mobile IoT networks. GeoTraq addresses the large LBS market segment that is currently under served with existing solutions due to high deployment costs (hardware, service, logistics), limited battery life and large form factor. We believe that there is a large under-served portion of the LBS market that is not addressed by existing solutions. RFID and Wi-Fi require close proximity for asset tracking, while GPS is too bulky and power hungry for many needs. GeoTraq addresses the white space in-between by designing wireless transceiver modules with technology that provides LBS directly from global Mobile IoT networks. GeoTraq’s technology allows for a substantially lower cost solution, extended service life, a small form factor and even disposable devices, which we believe can significantly reduce return logistics costs.

ApplianceSmart
 
At December 30, 2017, ApplianceSmart operated seventeen stores: six in the Minneapolis/St. Paul market; one in Rochester, Minn.; one in St. Cloud, Minn.; three in the Columbus, Ohio market; four in the Atlanta, Georgia market; and two in the San Antonio, Texas market.  ApplianceSmart is a major household appliance retailer with two product categories: one consisting of typical and commonly available, innovative appliances, and the other consisting of affordable value-priced, niche offerings, such as close-outs, factory overruns, discontinued models and special-buy appliances, including out-of-carton merchandise and others.  One example of a special-buy appliance may be due to manufacturer product redesign, in which a current model is updated to include a few new features and is then assigned a new model number. Because the major manufacturers—primarily Whirlpool, General Electric and Electrolux—ship only the latest models to retailers, a large quantity of the previous models often remain in the manufacturers’ inventories. Special-buy appliances typically are not integrated into the manufacturers’ normal distribution channels and require a different method of management, which we provide. On December 30, 2017, ARCA and ApplianceSmart entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with Purchaser. Pursuant to the Agreement, ARCA sold to the Purchaser all of the issued and outstanding shares of the ApplianceSmart Stock in exchange for $6,500,000. Effective April 1, 2018, Purchaser issued the Company a promissory note with a three-year term in the original principal amount of $3,919,494 for the balance of the purchase price. ApplianceSmart is guaranteeing the repayment of this note. On December 26, 2018, the ApplianceSmart Note was amended and restated to grant ARCA a security interest in the assets of the Purchaser, ApplianceSmart, and ApplianceSmart Contracting Inc. in exchange for modifying the repayments terms to provide for the payment in full of all accrued interest and principal on April 1, 2021, the maturity date of the ApplianceSmart Note. On March 15, 2019, the Company entered into agreements with third parties pursuant to which it agreed to subordinate the payment of indebtedness under the ApplianceSmart Note and the Company’s security interest in the assets of ApplianceSmart and other related parties in exchange for up to $1,200,000.
 
Subsidiaries
 
GeoTraq Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary that was initially incorporated in Nevada on October 20, 2016. GeoTraq is engaged in the development and design of Mobile IoT transceiver modules and expects to begin manufacturing and sales activities this year along with wireless subscription services. We acquired GeoTraq on August 18, 2017. See “Item 1 – Business - Recent Developments.”

Customers and Source of Supply
 
Utility Companies: We contract with utility companies or their program administrators and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs to provide a full range of appliance recycling and replacement services to help them achieve their energy savings goals. The contracts usually have terms of one to three years, with provisions for renewal at the option of the utility. Under some contracts, we manage all aspects, including advertising of the appliance recycling or replacement program. Under other contracts, we provide only specified services, such as collection and recycling.
 
Our contracts with utility customers prohibit us from repairing and selling appliances or appliance parts we receive through their programs. We have instituted tracking and auditing procedures to assure our customers that those appliances do not return to use.
 
Our pricing for energy efficiency program contracts is generally on a per-appliance basis and depends upon several factors, including:
 

1. | Total number of appliances expected to be processed and/or replaced.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Length of the contract term.
---+-----------------------------


3. | Specific services the utility requires us to provide.
---+------------------------------------------------------


4. | Market factors, including labor rates and transportation costs.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Anticipated revenue associated with the sale of recycled appliance byproducts.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Competitive bidding scenarios.

Appliance Manufacturers: When we operated our retail business, we worked with appliance manufacturers, including Electrolux, GE Appliances, LG, Samsung and Whirlpool, to acquire the appliances we sold in our ApplianceSmart stores. We purchased new, special-buy appliances, such as discontinued models, out-of-carton units and factory overruns, and sold them at a significant discount to full retail prices. In addition, our participation in a national buying cooperative enabled us to purchase the latest models of new appliances to fill out our product mix.
Company Operations
 
In our recycling operations, our Company-trained technicians first inspect and categorize each appliance to identify the types of hazardous materials, if any, it contains. We then process the appliances to remove and manage the environmentally hazardous substances according to federal, state and local regulations. Recyclable components are managed by materials recyclers, and we deliver the processed appliance shells to local scrap processing facilities, where they shred and recycle the metals. We are aggressively pursuing additional utility customers but have a limited ability to project revenues from new utility programs in 2019 and thereafter. We cannot predict recycling or replacement volumes. However, we were successful in obtaining new contracts in 2018 with new and former customers across the country.
 
Appliances collected through utility customers’ energy conservation programs are recycled to prevent re-use. We process and recycle these units using environmentally sound systems and techniques.
 
GeoTraq is continuing to develop its technology and has recently entered into pilot test agreements with various third parties.
 
Principal Products and Services
 
At December 29, 2018, we generated revenues from two sources: recycling and byproduct, including carbon offsets. Recycling revenues were generated by charging fees for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs and through the sale of new ENERGY STAR® appliances to utility companies for installation in the homes of a specific segment of their customers. Byproduct revenues were generated by selling scrap materials, such as metal and plastics, from appliances we collected and recycled, those processed at AAP, and prior to December 30, 2017, including those from our ApplianceSmart stores. Carbon offset revenues were created by the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants acquired through various recycling programs from our ApplianceSmart stores and through processing of refrigerators and freezers at AAP. Our technology segment did not generate any revenues in 2018.
 
During fiscal year 2018, we operated two reportable segments: recycling and technology. During fiscal year 2017, we operated three reportable segments: retail, recycling, and technology (commencing on August 18, 2017). The retail segment was comprised of sales generated through our ApplianceSmart stores. Our recycling segment includes all fees charged for collecting, recycling and installing appliances for utilities and other customers and includes byproduct revenue, which is generated primarily through the recycling of appliances. Our technology segment is comprised of a development stage company, we are engaged in the development, design and, ultimately, we expect the sale of, cellular transceiver modules, also known as Mobile IoT modules. In 2017, through August 15, 2017, and for the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2016, we consolidated AAP in our financial statements. Sales generated by AAP are included in byproduct revenues in our recycling segment. Financial information about our segments is included in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 6 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We use a variety of methods to promote awareness of our products and services. We believe that we are recognized as a leader in the appliance recycling and replacement industry.
 
We market our appliance recycling and replacement services to utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs by contacting prospective end user customers directly, delivering educational presentations at conferences for energy efficiency professionals, participating in utility industry trade shows, networking with key affiliates of electric power and environmental associations, and promoting on our corporate website at www.ARCAInc.com.  We submit sales proposals for our services to interested parties and in response to requests for bid.

GeoTraq had no sales during 2018.
 
Our ApplianceSmart concept included establishing large showrooms in metropolitan locations where we offered consumers a selection of hundreds of appliances at each of our stores.
 
Seasonality
 
Promotional activities for programs in which the utility sponsor conducts all advertising are generally strong during the second and third calendar quarters, leading to higher customer demand for services during that time period.  As a result, we experience a surge in business during the second and third calendar quarters, which generally declines through the fourth and first calendar quarters until advertising activities resume.
 
GeoTraq had no customers at December 29, 2018.
 
Prior to our sale of ApplianceSmart, we experienced some seasonality in retail revenues, with revenues in the second and third calendar quarters being slightly higher than revenues in the first and fourth calendar quarters.
 
Competition
 
Many factors, including obtaining adequate resources to create and support the infrastructure required to operate large-scale appliance recycling and replacement programs, affect competition in the industry. We generally compete for contracts with several other appliance recycling businesses, energy services management companies, and new-appliance retailers. We also compete with small hauling or recycling companies based in the program’s service territory. Many of these companies, including used-appliance dealers that call themselves “appliance recyclers,” resell in the secondary market a percentage of the used appliances they accept for recycling. The unsalable units may not be properly processed to remove environmentally harmful materials because these companies do not have the capability to offer the full range of services we provide.
 
We expect our primary competition for appliance recycling and replacement contracts with existing and new customers to come from a variety of sources, including:
 

1. | Existing recycling companies.
---+------------------------------


2. | Entrepreneurs entering the appliance recycling business.
---+---------------------------------------------------------


3. | Management consultants.
---+------------------------


4. | Major waste hauling companies.
---+-------------------------------


5. | Scrap metal processors.
---+------------------------


6. | National and regional new appliance retailers.
---+-----------------------------------------------

 
In addition, utility companies and other customers may choose to provide all or some of the services required to operate their appliance recycling and replacement programs internally rather than contracting with outside vendors. We have no assurance that we will be able to compete profitably in any of our chosen markets.
 
GeoTraq plans on operating in an industry segment that is made of numerous competing technologies designed to connect devices to the Internet of Things. The business’s wireless solution uses Mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”) based on LTE CAT-M and the newly released NB-IoT protocols that were defined in the GSMA’s (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association) 3GPP Release 13 standard. The Mobile IoT industry utilizes radio spectrum that is licensed to wireless carries by various governmental regulatory agencies around the world. Mobile IoT is extremely competitive and constantly changing as carriers, manufacturers and solution providers offer innovation to the IoT marketplace. GeoTraq believes there is a large under-served opportunity for “Simple IoT” solutions that significantly reduce the complexity, cycle time and cost of deploying Location Base Services (“LBS”) and sensor monitoring solutions. The company’s transceiver modules and associated wireless connectivity subscription service is specifically targeted at accomplishing these objectives.

Prior to our sale of ApplianceSmart, our retail competition came primarily from new-appliance and other special-buy retailers. Each ApplianceSmart store competed with local and national retail appliance chains, as well as with independently owned retailers. Many of these retailers have been in business longer than ApplianceSmart and may have significantly greater assets.
 
Government Regulation
 
Federal, state, and local governments regulate appliance collection, recycling, and sales activities. While some requirements apply nationwide, others vary by market. The many laws and regulations that affect appliance recycling include landfill disposal restrictions, hazardous waste management requirements and air quality standards. For example, the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act prohibit the venting of all Refrigerants while servicing or disposing of appliances.
 
Each of our recycling facilities maintains the appropriate registrations, permits and licenses for operating at its location. We register our recycling centers as hazardous waste generators with the EPA and obtain all appropriate regional and local licenses for managing hazardous wastes. Licensed hazardous waste companies transport and recycle or dispose of the hazardous materials we generate. Our collection vehicles and our transportation employees are required to comply with all U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) licensing requirements.
 
In 2009, our then President and Chief Executive Officer, Edward R. (Jack) Cameron, was selected to represent the appliance recycling industry in the Climate Action Reserve’s 23-member workgroup that was tasked with developing the U.S. Ozone-Depleting Substances Project Protocol for the Destruction of Domestic High Global Warming Potential Ozone-Depleting Substances. The Climate Action Reserve is a national offsets registry working to ensure integrity, transparency and financial value in the U.S. carbon market. The protocol was issued on February 3, 2010, and provides guidance to account for, report and verify greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with destruction of high global warming potential ozone-depleting substances that would have otherwise been released to the atmosphere, including those used in both foam and refrigerant applications.
 
In January 2013, through the authority of the California Air Resources Board, California launched a greenhouse gas (“GHG”) cap-and-trade program that will encompass 85% of the state’s emissions and affect all businesses operating in California by 2020; in 2017, the state legislature extended the program through 2030. The first compliance period enforcing the GHG emissions limits for capped business sectors began January 1, 2013. Entities may meet up to eight percent of their compliance obligations with freely sold or traded offset credits, such as those created through the voluntary destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants. We have been an active participant in California’s developing carbon offset market and anticipate increased involvement as the program expands.
 
Our retail stores obtained business licenses, sales tax licenses and permits required for their locations. Our distribution and service vehicles comply with all DOT licensing requirements.
 
Approximately thirty of ARCA Recycling’s clients participate in the EPA’s voluntary RAD program by committing to employing best environmental practices to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases through the proper disposal of refrigeration appliances at end of life. We prepare annual RAD reports quantifying the materials collected to submit to EPA on behalf of our clients.
 
Although we believe that further governmental regulation of the appliance recycling industry could have a positive effect on us, we cannot predict the direction of future legislation. Under some circumstances, for example, further regulation could materially increase our operational costs or reduce environmental requirements for disposing of appliances at end of life. In addition, under some circumstances we may be subject to contingent liabilities because we handle hazardous materials. We believe we are in compliance with all government regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials, and we have environmental insurance to mitigate the impact of any potential contingent liability.
 
GeoTraq’s Mobile IoT modules utilize low power wireless transmitters the emit RF energy waves, which are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and may be subject to regulation by other domestic and international agencies. GeoTraq believes that FCC rules Part 15, Part 20, Part 22, Part 24 and Part 27 may apply to the company’s products. GeoTraq believes that its products are safe and will utilize FCC accredited testing laboratories to verify and certify that the company’s modules comply with all required regulatory requirements. In addition, GeoTraq intends to seek and obtain necessary licenses and permits from the FCC and other regulatory agencies as required by law.
