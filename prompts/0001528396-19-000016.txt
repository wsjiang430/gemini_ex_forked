Item 1. | Business

Overview
We provide a technology platform, composed of software, services, and a partner ecosystem, for the global Property and Casualty (“P&C”) insurance industry. 
Guidewire InsurancePlatformTM applications support core operations, data management and analytics, and digital engagement that can be deployed in the cloud or on-premise, and are connected to numerous data sources and third-party applications. Our applications are designed to work together to strengthen our customers’ ability to adapt and succeed in a rapidly changing market. Guidewire InsuranceSuite™ and Guidewire InsuranceNowTM provide core transactional systems of record that support the entire insurance lifecycle, including product definition, distribution, underwriting, policy-holder services, and claims management. Guidewire InsuranceSuite is a highly-configurable and scalable system primarily comprised of three applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be licensed separately or together and can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud. Guidewire InsuranceNow is a cloud-based system that offers policy, billing, and claims management functionality to insurers that prefer an all-in-one solution. Our data and analytics applications enable insurers to manage data more effectively, gain insights into their business, and underwrite new and evolving risks. Our digital engagement applications enable digital sales, omni-channel service and enhanced claims experiences for policyholders, agents, vendor partners and field personnel. To support P&C insurers globally, we have localized, and will continue to localize, our software for use in a variety of international regulatory, language, and currency environments.
Guidewire delivers Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscriptions via Guidewire Cloud™. Guidewire’s cloud products enable insurers to focus on business agility while transferring undifferentiating IT responsibilities to Guidewire, in exchange for a subscription fee. All Guidewire products are available via Guidewire Cloud with a number of products only available via Guidewire Cloud.
Our customers range from some of the largest global insurance carriers or their subsidiaries, such as Aviva, AXA, and Zurich to predominantly national carriers such as Basler Versicherung (Switzerland), Direct Line Group (U.K.), Farmers Insurance (U.S.), IAG (Australia), MS&AD (Japan), Nationwide (U.S.), PZU (Poland) and San Cristobal Seguros S.A. (Argentina) and carriers that serve specific states and/or regions such as Automobile Club of Southern California (California), Canadian Automobile Association Insurance Company (Ontario), Kentucky Farm Bureau (Kentucky), and Vermont Mutual Insurance Group (Vermont).
Our customer engagement is led by our direct sales team and supported by our system integrator (“SI”) partners. We maintain and continue to grow our sales and marketing efforts globally, and maintain regional sales centers in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. 
We began our principal business operations in 2001. To date, we have generated a substantial majority of our software license fees through license agreements that generally have a term of at least two years. We generally price our licenses based on the amount of direct written premiums (“DWP”) that will be managed by our solutions. Our term licenses for both recurring term license and maintenance fees are typically invoiced annually in advance or, in certain cases, quarterly. Term licenses that are greater than one year generally include extended payment terms. We also generate cloud-based revenue (also referred to as “subscriptions”). 
4

Currently, these subscriptions may be for terms greater than two years, and we anticipate that a majority of these arrangements will be billed annually or quarterly in advance, although in some instances additional fees may be assessed in arrears as customers increase their DWP. Revenue derived from these subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contractual term beginning after the subscription is effectively provisioned, which is the date our software service is made available to customers. We anticipate that subscription revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue as we develop and bring to market more cloud-based solutions to meet increasing industry demand. Services revenue is primarily derived from implementation and training services performed for our customers. Substantially all of our services revenue is billed on a time and materials basis.
Industry Background
The P&C insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated, and complex. It is also highly competitive, with carriers competing primarily on the following factors: product differentiation, pricing options, customer service, marketing and advertising, affiliate programs and channel strategies.
P&C insurers continue to actively modernize the transactional systems that support the key functional areas of P&C insurance: product definition, underwriting and policy administration, claims management and billing. Product definition specifies the insurance coverage, pricing, and financial and legal terms of insurance policies. Underwriting and policy administration includes collecting information from potential policyholders, determining appropriate coverages and terms, pricing policies, issuing policies and updating and maintaining policies over their lifetimes. Claims management includes loss intake, investigation and evaluation of incidents, settlement negotiation, vendor management, litigation management and payment processing. Billing includes policyholder invoicing, payment collection, agent commission calculation and disbursement. We believe insurers that adopt modern infrastructures can enhance customer experience, operate more efficiently and introduce innovative products more rapidly.
We believe the P&C industry is experiencing accelerating change in how insurers engage with, sell to, and manage relationships with individual and business customers. Today, P&C insurers are striving to respond to significant changes in their competitive marketplace and the character of the risks they underwrite. The most significant changes include: 

• | a rise in customer expectations for digital, omni-channel interaction;


• | a growth in demand for personalized products and services;


• | an increase in technology-driven changes in vehicular risk;


• | demand for coverage of “21st century risks” such as terrorism, cybersecurity and reputational risk;


• | advances in the use of data to better market to and engage with customers, price policies and manage claims;


• | development of opportunities to compete or partner with non-traditional players that offer disruptive technology-based value propositions; and


• | the introduction and leveraging of new technologies, such as drones, artificial intelligence, the “Internet of Things” and blockchain technology.

In response to these challenges and opportunities, we believe that the P&C insurance industry is entering a phase of increasing investment in technology, characterized by a moderated pace of core modernization programs, and growing adoption of new digital engagement and data analytics offerings. 
While each insurer may have different goals and priorities when pursuing new IT investments, there are several major themes that we believe guide these investments: 

• | Legacy Modernization. A significant portion of the market continues to rely on legacy systems. We believe new claims, policy management, and billing systems will continue to be adopted as insurers that rely on legacy systems seek to gain operating efficiencies, expand into new markets and lines of business, and introduce new digital and data offerings. 


• | New Digital Engagement Models. We believe that insurers will need to provide a more intuitive, digital user experience to reduce the risk of customer dissatisfaction and loss. Investment in digital user experience will allow insurers to deepen their engagement with customers and transition from passive and transactional customer interactions to active and advisory relationships. This transition will require investments in software products that are designed to model user journeys and enable more frequent, informed and dynamic interactions between insurers and their customers. We believe these efforts can improve financial performance for insurers through increased lead conversions and lower customer churn. 


• | Smarter Decision-Making. Insurers are seeking to explore, visualize, and analyze operational and third-party data to optimize decision-making across the insurance lifecycle. We believe that such predictive analytical solutions are most effective when they provide predictive scores and other analytical insights to insurers’ employees as they perform their underwriting and claims management activities. 

Insurers may also apply data and machine learning to automate certain tasks whenever possible, thereby enabling efficiencies, such as straight-through processing, that lessen the burden on subject matter experts. 
5


• | Innovation. Insurers are under pressure to innovate across their product lifecycle in order to grow their business and improve service quality. Examples of focus areas include creating products to target under-insured risks such as cyber, supply chain disruption, and reputational and partnering with InsurTech providers to streamline operations and improve service to policyholders and agents.


• | Cloud-Delivered Solutions. We believe that increased recognition of the compelling economic benefits of deploying software solutions on public infrastructure combined with reduced concerns about the security and reliability of such platforms will cause more insurers to consider cloud-deployed solutions. Insurers benefit from an optimized division of labor and risk, allowing third parties to manage their infrastructure as they focus on competitively differentiating activities. 

Products
Guidewire InsurancePlatform is designed to offer insurers the ability to adapt and succeed in meeting these challenges and capitalize on new opportunities. We believe that the proliferation of modern back-office infrastructures has significantly increased the ability of insurers to utilize new solutions to grow revenue, reduce costs and losses, improve pricing and engage more deeply and in more intuitive ways with a customer base that is increasingly comfortable with mobile and automated forms of self-service and communication. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development and strategic investments so that we may further assist insurers in reaching their business goals.

It enables insurers to manage portfolio exposure accumulations and develop new products. Through a process called “data listening”, Guidewire Cyence Risk Analytics collects technical and behavioral data from a variety of sources, including public data, open-source data, proprietary data, and third-party data. 
Digital Engagement
 Guidewire Digital Engagement Applications 
Our Digital Engagement Applications enable insurers to provide digital experiences to customers, agents, vendors and field personnel through their device of choice. As consumers increasingly use self-service functions on the Internet and on mobile devices, we believe that many of them prefer to interact with their insurance providers digitally and they expect to have consistent and efficient transactional experience through multiple channels, whether online, in-person or by phone. Our Digital Engagement 
7

applications also benefit agents and brokers who are seeking to automate business processes with insurers to improve customer service and productivity.
Technology
Our applications are designed to assist P&C insurers to grow their business, improve customer and agent engagement, lower operating costs and improve decision making. We have increased the scope of Guidewire InsurancePlatform through internal development and acquisitions. This growing scope has required greater investment in the development of application interfaces and shared services necessary to unify the operations and user experience across our applications. To meet the anticipated increased demand for cloud-delivered solutions, we have increased investments to leverage the growing number of technology services provided by on-demand infrastructure vendors such as Amazon with AWS and Microsoft with Azure. The shift to cloud-delivered solutions has also required significant focus in improving our ability to manage and operate our applications since our cloud-based deployments, unlike our on-premise implementations, shift many operational responsibilities to us. Finally, we continue to improve the scalability of our applications, which are required to perform millions of complex transactions that must balance on a daily basis. This accuracy must be maintained not only during normal business operations, but also during extraordinary events such as catastrophes, which may result in extremely high transaction volume in a short period of time. 
Services
Implementation Services
We provide implementation and integration services to help our customers realize the benefits of our software products and subscription services. Our implementation teams assist customers in building implementation plans, integrating our software with their existing systems and defining business rules and specific requirements unique to each customer and installation. We also partner with leading system integration consulting firms, certified on our software, to achieve scalable, cost-effective implementations for our customers. 
Guidewire Production Services
Customers that contract with us for a cloud-based version of any Guidewire InsurancePlatform application receive access to our software, 24x7 technical management, monitoring and, in some cases, version upgrades. Customers may also receive additional services, such as defect fixes, regulatory updates, and minor platform delivery enhancements.
Customers
We market and sell our products to a wide variety of global P&C insurers ranging from some of the largest global insurers to national and regional carriers. We believe strong customer relationships are a key driver of our success given the long-term nature of our customer engagements and importance of customer references for new sales. We focus on developing and maintaining our customer relationships through customer service and account management. As of July 31, 2018, we had approximately 380 customers using one or more of our products in 39 countries. 
Strategic Relationships
We have extensive relationships with system integration, consulting, and industry partners. Our network of partners has expanded as interest in and adoption of our products has grown. We encourage our partners to co-market, pursue joint sales initiatives and drive broader adoption of our technology, helping us grow our business more efficiently and enabling us to focus our engineering resources on continued innovation and further enhancement of our solutions.
As part of our PartnerConnect alliance program, we have a community of Solution Partners developing integration accelerators that enable their on-premise and cloud-based software solutions to interoperate with our products. As of July 31, 2018, more than 85 of these partner-developed integrations have been validated by us and awarded Ready for Guidewire branding. Guidewire Marketplace provides our customers with an online forum to learn about and download Ready for Guidewire integration accelerators for use with our products. These accelerators help customers reduce implementation risk and effort, and lower the total cost of implementation and operation. We anticipate expanding the reach of Guidewire Marketplace.

Sales and Marketing
Consistent with our industry focus and the mission-critical needs our products address, our sales and marketing efforts are tailored to communicate effectively to senior executives within the P&C industry. Our sales, marketing, and executive teams work together to cultivate long-term relationships with current and prospective customers in each of the geographies in which we are active.
Our direct sales team serves as both our exclusive sales channel and our account management function and is organized by geographic region across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. We augment our sales professionals with a presales team possessing insurance domain and technical expertise, who engage customers in sessions to understand their specific business needs and then represent our products through demonstrations tailored to address those needs.
Our marketing team supports sales with competitive analysis and sales tools, while investing to strengthen our brand name and reputation. We participate at industry conferences, are published frequently in the industry press and have active relationships with all of the major industry analysts. We also host Connections, our annual user conference where customers both participate in and deliver presentations on a wide range of Guidewire and insurance technology topics. We invite potential customers and partners to our user conference, as we believe customer references are a key component of driving new sales. Our strong relationships with leading system integrators enhance our direct sales through co-marketing efforts and by providing additional market validation of the distinctiveness and quality of our offerings.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus on enhancing our products to meet the increasingly complex requirements of P&C insurers by broadening the capabilities and delivery options of Guidewire InsurancePlatform and its associated applications. These efforts are intended to help our customers improve their operations; drive greater digital engagement with their customers, agents and brokers; and gather, store and analyze data to improve business decisions. We also invest significantly in developing the product definitions and integrations necessary to have our applications meet the market requirements of each country or state in which we sell our software. This market-segment specific functionality must be updated regularly in order to stay current with regulatory changes in each market. We rely on a multi-national engineering team, which has grown organically and through acquisitions. 
Competition
The software market that caters to the P&C insurance industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Increased spending by carriers on software solutions and the emergence of new platforms that have broadened from core system modernization to new digital engagement and data and analytics solutions, have generated significant interest among investors and entrepreneurs. Increased capital allows market participants to adopt more aggressive go-to-market strategies, improve existing products, introduce new ones, and consolidate with other vendors. This market is also subject to changing technology preferences, shifting customer needs and the introduction of new cloud-delivered models. This creates an environment of increasing competition. Our current and future competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer. Our current competitors include, but are not limited to:

Internally developed software | Many large insurance companies have sufficient IT resources to maintain and augment their own proprietary internal systems, or to consider developing new custom systems; 
Technology services firms | Firms such as DXC Technology, NTT Data, and Tata Consultancy Services Limited offer software and systems or develop custom, proprietary solutions for the P&C insurance industry; 
P&C insurance software vendors | Vendors such as 1insurer (formerly Innovation Group), CodeObjects, Duck Creek, eBaoTech Corporation, EIS Group, Fadata AD, FINEOS, Insurity, Inc., Keylane/Quinity, Majesco, OneShield, Inc., Patriot Technology Solutions, Prima Solutions, RGI, Sapiens International Corporation, StoneRiver, Inc., and TIA Technology A/S provide software solutions that are specifically designed to meet the needs of P&C insurers; and
Horizontal software vendors | Vendors such as Pegasystems Inc. and SAP AG offer software that can be customized to address the needs of P&C insurers. 

Competitive factors in our industry depend on the product being offered, and the size, geographic market, and line of business of potential customers. The principal competitive factors include product functionality, performance, customer references, total cost of ownership, solution completeness, implementation track record, and in-depth knowledge of the P&C insurance industry. We typically compete favorably on the basis of these factors in most geographies.
9

As we expand our product portfolio, we may begin to compete with software and service providers we have not previously competed against. For example, companies such as Verisk, SAS, IBM and Towers Watson offer data and analytics tools that may, in time, be more competitive than our offerings. Some of these potential competitors may also acquire companies which offer P&C insurance software.
Intellectual Property
The software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and to protect against third-party claims and litigation related to intellectual property. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections. We own or have pending a significant number of patents and patent applications, which generally apply to our software. Our owned patents have expiration dates starting in 2025. We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks, as well as pending applications for such registrations, in order to protect our brand both in the United States and internationally.
Employees
As of July 31, 2018, we had 2,292 employees, including 838 in professional services, 121 in technical support and licensing operations, 749 in research and development, 329 in sales and marketing, and 255 in general and administrative roles. As of July 31, 2018, we had 1,466 employees in the United States and 826 employees internationally. Our employees in the United States are not represented by a labor union, however, in certain foreign locations, there are workers’ councils that represent our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonal variations in our license and other revenue as a result of increased customer orders in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. We generally see a modest increase in orders in our second fiscal quarter, which is the quarter ending January 31, due to customer buying patterns. We also see increased orders in our fourth fiscal quarter, which is the quarter ending July 31, due to efforts by our sales team to achieve annual incentives. This seasonal pattern, however, may be absent in any given year. For example, the timing of a small number of large transactions or the entry into term license agreements with a term of more than two years may be sufficient to disrupt seasonal revenue trends. Additionally, the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) will also heighten the seasonal impact on our new term licenses that are multi-year in nature with more revenue recognized upfront upon delivery of our software. On an annual basis, our maintenance revenue which is recognized ratably, may also be impacted in the event that seasonal patterns change significantly. During fiscal years in which subscriptions increase as a percentage of total sales, the revenue we can recognize in such fiscal year will be reduced, deferred revenue will increase, and our reported revenue growth will be adversely affected due to the ratable nature of these arrangements. The seasonal nature of our sales and the concentration of such sales in our fourth fiscal quarter magnifies this impact. 
Our services revenue is also subject to seasonal fluctuations, though to a lesser degree than our license revenue. Our services revenue is impacted by the number of billable days in a given fiscal quarter. The fiscal quarter ended January 31 usually has fewer billable days due to the impact of the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s holidays. The fiscal quarter ended July 31 usually has fewer billable days due to the impact of vacation times taken by our professional staff. Because we pay our services professionals the same amounts throughout the year, our gross margins on our services revenue is usually lower in these quarters. This seasonal pattern, however, may be absent in any given year.
