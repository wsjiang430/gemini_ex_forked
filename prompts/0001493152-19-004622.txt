Introduction
 
We are developers of application publishing software which includes application virtualization software and cloud computing software for multiple computer operating systems including Windows, UNIX and several Linux-based variants. Our application publishing software solutions are sold under the brand name GO-Global, which is our sole revenue source. GO-Global is an application access solution for use and/or resale by independent software vendors (“ISVs”), corporate enterprises, governmental and educational institutions, and others who wish to take advantage of cross-platform remote access and Web-enabled access to their existing software applications, as well as those who are deploying secure, private cloud environments.
 
From 2012 to 2016 we developed several products in the field of software productivity for mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, which have been marketed under the hopTo brand. We also made significant investments in intellectual property (“IP”) and filed many patents designed to protect the new technologies embedded in hopTo. We were granted a total of 56 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office as part of this effort.
 
Except for the sale of 7 patents sold to Salesforce.com during the fourth quarter of 2017, we own all hopTo-related IP including source-code, related patents, and the relevant trademarks. We continue to believe that we may be able to extract value from these assets and are currently working to do so at this time. For detailed historical information on the hopTo products and technologies, please refer to our previously filed Annual Report on form 10-K which are available at www.sec.gov. Such filings are being noted for historical information only; unless expressly noted, they are not incorporated herein by reference.

The GO-Global Software Products
 
Our GO-Global product offerings, which currently are our only revenue source, can be categorized into product families as follows:
 

● | GO-Global for Windows: Allows access to Windows-based applications from remote locations and a variety of connections, including the Internet connections. The Windows applications run on a central computer server along with GO-Global Windows Host software. This allows the applications to be accessed remotely via GO-Global Client software, or a Web browser, over many types of data connections, regardless of the bandwidth or operating system. Web-enabling is achieved without modifying the underlying application’s code or requiring costly add-ons.

● | GO-Global for UNIX: Allows access to UNIX and Linux-based applications from remote locations and a variety of connections, including the Internet and connections. The UNIX/Linux applications run on a central computer server along with the GO-Global for UNIX Host software. This allows the applications to be accessed and run remotely via GO-Global Client software or a Web browser without having to modify the application’s code or requiring costly add-ons. 
● | GO-Global Client: We offer a range of GO-Global Client software that allows remote application access from a wide variety of local, remote and mobile platforms, including Windows, Linux, UNIX, Apple OS X and iOS, and Google Android. We plan to continue to develop GO-Global Client software for new portable and mobile devices.

Target Markets
 
The target market for our GO-Global products includes small to medium-sized companies, departments within large corporations, governmental and educational institutions, independent software vendors (ISVs) and value-added resellers (VARs). Our software enables these targeted organizations to move their existing applications to the public cloud and provide SaaS, or move them to a secure, private cloud environment. By using our software, organizations can give their remote users, partners and customers access to their native applications. Our software is designed to allow these organizations and enterprises to tailor the configuration of the end-user device for a particular purpose, rather than following a “one PC fits all” high-cost ownership model. We believe our opportunities are as follows:

● | ISVs. By Web-enabling their applications through use of our products, we believe that our ISV customers can accelerate their time to market without the risks and delays associated with rewriting applications or using other third-party software, thereby opening up additional revenue opportunities and securing greater satisfaction and loyalty from their customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Our technology integrates with their existing software applications without sacrificing the full-featured look and feel of such applications, thereby providing ISVs with out-of-the-box Web-enabled applications with their own branding for licensed, volume distribution to their enterprise customers. We further believe that ISVs that effectively address the Web computing needs of customers and the emerging application service provider market will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
● | Enterprises Employing a Mix of UNIX, Linux, Macintosh and Windows. Small to medium-sized companies that utilize a mixed computing environment require cross-platform connectivity software, like GO-Global Host and/or GO-Global Gateway, which will allow users to access applications from different client devices. We believe that our server-based software products will significantly reduce the cost and complexity of connecting PCs to various applications. 
● | Enterprises with Remote Computer Users and/or Extended Markets. We believe that remote computer users and enterprises with extended markets comprise two of the faster growing market segments in the computing industry. Extended enterprises permit access to their computing resources by their customers, suppliers, distributors and other partners, thereby affording them manufacturing flexibility, increased speed-to-market, and enhanced customer satisfaction. For example, extended enterprises may maintain decreased inventory via just-in-time, vendor-managed inventory and related techniques, or they may license their proprietary software application on a “pay-per-use” model, based on actual time usage by the user. The early adoption of extended enterprise software may be driven in part by an organization’s need to exchange information over a wide variety of computing platforms. We believe that our server-based software products, along with our low-impact communications protocol, which has been designed to enable highly efficient low-bandwidth connections, are well positioned to provide extended enterprises with the necessary means to exchange information over a wide variety of computing platforms. 
● | VARs. The VAR channel presents an additional sales force for our products and services. In addition to creating broader awareness of our GO-Global products, VARs also provide integration and support services for our current and potential customers. Our products allow VARs to offer a cost-effective competitive alternative for server-based, or thin-client, computing. In addition, reselling our GO-Global products creates new revenue streams for our VARs. 

Strategic Customer Relationships
 
We believe it is important to maintain our current strategic alliances and to seek suitable new alliances in order to enhance shareholder value, improve our technology and/or enhance our ability to penetrate relevant target markets. We also are focusing on strategic relationships that have immediate revenue generating potential, strengthen our position in the server-based software market, add complementary capabilities and/or raise awareness of our products and us. Our strategic relationships for all GO-Global products include the following:

● | We are party to a non-exclusive distribution agreement with KitASP, a Japanese application service provider founded by companies within Japan’s electronics and infrastructure industries, including NTT DATA, Mitsubishi Electric, Omron, RICS, Toyo Engineering and Hitachi. Pursuant to this agreement, which was entered into in September 2011, KitASP has licensed our GO-Global product line for inclusion in their software products, primarily their server-bundled application service provider software solution. Either party may terminate the contract upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We are party to a non-exclusive channel partner agreement with Elosoft Informatica Ltda, a South American distributor of various technology products, including both hardware and software offerings, and related services. Under the terms of this agreement, Elosoft has licensed both our GO-Global Windows Host and GO-Global for UNIX software for deployment to their distribution network with both sub-distributors and end-users. Our agreement with Elosoft, which was originally entered into in February 2005, automatically renews annually. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.

● | We are party to a non-exclusive global purchasing agreement with Alcatel-Lucent, a telecommunications, network systems and services company. Pursuant to this relationship, which started in July 1999, Alcatel-Lucent has licensed our GO-Global for UNIX software for inclusion with their software products. Many of Alcatel-Lucent’s customers are using our server-based software to remote access Alcatel-Lucent’s Network Management Systems applications. Since December 2012, we have mutually agreed with Alcatel-Lucent to renew this contract each year for additional one-year with terms consistent with those set forth in the expired contract. The current renewal period expires in December 2019.

● | We are party to a non-exclusive distribution agreement with GE Intelligent Platforms (“GE”), a U.S. based designer, manufacturer, and supplier of products for industrial control and automation. GE has licensed our GO-Global product line for inclusion in their automation and production management software products. Our agreement with GE, which was originally entered into in December 2002, automatically renews annually. Either party may terminate the contract upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. 
● | In August 2011 we entered into an agreement with GAD eG (“GAD”), a Germany based provider of information technology, software development and data processing solutions for retail banks. GAD licensed our GO-Global for Windows software and embedded it in their banking applications. This agreement covered a one-time transaction of theirs with a large German bank. The installation of their software application generated significant product license sales for us in 2011 and 2012. Since then, we continued to have large maintenance renewals from these product licenses and expect to have maintenance sales in future years; however we do not expect to have future product licensing sales to GAD comparable to the 2012 and 2011 levels. 
● | In January 2010, we entered into a non-exclusive reseller and distribution agreement with Information Delivery Systems, LLC (IDS), a U.S. based publisher and hosting solutions provider for churches and educational institutions. IDS has licensed our GO-Global for Windows software and has utilized it as the hosting engine for its cloud-based solutions. Our agreement with IDS automatically renews annually. Either party may terminate the contract upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. 

Sales, Marketing and Support
 
Sales and marketing efforts for our software products are directed at increasing product awareness and demand among ISVs, small to medium-sized enterprises, departments within larger corporations and VARs who have a vertical orientation or are focused on Windows, UNIX and/or Linux environments. Current marketing activities have been limited due to budget constraints but include Internet marketing, direct response, promotional materials, and maintaining an active Web presence for marketing and sales purposes.
 
We currently consider the following to be our most significant customers and partners. For the purposes of this table, “Sales” refers to the dollar value of orders received from these customers and partners in the period indicated. These Sales values do not necessarily equal recognized revenue for these periods due to our revenue recognition policies which require deferral of revenue associated with prepaid software service fees. In 2017, deferrals of fees associated with stocking orders of software licenses were also required.

Many of our customers enter into, and periodically renew, maintenance contracts to ensure continued product updates and support. Currently, we offer maintenance contracts for one, two, three and five-year periods.
 
Operations
 
We perform all purchasing, order processing and shipping of products and accounting functions related to our operations. Although we generally ship products electronically, when a customer requires us to physically ship them a disc, production of the disc, printing of documentation and packaging are also accomplished through in-house means; however, since virtually all of our orders are currently being fulfilled electronically, we do not maintain any prepackaged inventory. Additionally, we have relatively little backlog at any given time; thus, we do not consider backlog a significant indicator of future performance.
Competition
 
The software markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Competitive factors in our market space include price, product quality, functionality, product differentiation and the breadth and variety of product offerings and product features. We believe that our products offer certain advantages over our competitors, particularly in product performance and market positioning.
 
GO-Global competes with developers of conventional server-based software for the individual PC, as well as with other companies in the cloud computing software market and the application virtualization software market. We believe our principal competitors in the cloud computing software market include Citrix Systems, Inc., OpenText Communications, Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation. Citrix is an established leading vendor of virtualization software, OpenText is an established market leader for remote access to UNIX applications and Microsoft is an established leading vendor of Windows operating systems and services for servers.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had a full-time equivalent of 13.5 total employees, including 2 in marketing, sales and support, 8.5 in research and development (which is inclusive of employees who may also perform customer service related activities), 2.5 in administration and finance and 0.5 in our patent group. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
