ITEM 1.      BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Lifeway was founded in 1986 by Michael Smolyansky shortly after he and his wife, Ludmila Smolyansky, emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States. Lifeway was the first to successfully introduce kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. In the thirty-six years that have followed, Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural, “better for you” foods.
PRODUCTS
 
Our primary product is drinkable kefir, a cultured dairy product. Lifeway Kefir is tart and tangy, high in protein, calcium and vitamin D. Thanks to our exclusive blend of kefir cultures, each cup of kefir contains 12 live and active cultures and 25 to 30 billion beneficial CFU (Colony Forming Units) at the time of manufacture.
 
We manufacture (directly or through co-packers) and market products under the Lifeway, Fresh Made and Glen Oaks Farms brand names, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers.
 
Our product categories are:
 

· | Drinkable Kefir, sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and types;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | European-style soft cheeses, including farmer cheese, white cheese, and Sweet Kiss; 
· | Cream and other, which consists primarily of cream, a byproduct of making our kefir; 
· | ProBugs, a line of kefir products designed for children; 
· | Drinkable Yogurt, sold in a variety of sizes and flavors; and 
· | Other Dairy, which consists primarily of Fresh Made butter and sour cream. 

 
Net sales of products by category were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Product innovation and new product development
 
Lifeway is committed to maintaining its positions as the leading producer of kefir and a recognized leader in the market for probiotic products. We routinely evaluate opportunities for new product flavors and formulations, improved package design, new product configurations and other innovation avenues. Beyond our core drinkable kefir products, we have an ongoing effort to extend the strength of the Lifeway brand and leverage the capabilities of the Lifeway organization into fresh categories and into additional channels of trade, such as Convenience; Foodservice; Club; and Drug. In 2022, we maintained the level of focus on product innovations, packaging innovations, and growth opportunities. These product innovation and development efforts have led to additional revenue opportunities.
 
Lifeway considers research and development of new products to be a significant part of our overall business philosophy. Where possible, we leverage our existing staff and facilities to conduct our innovation, research, and development efforts, rather than maintaining a dedicated research and development staff and facilities or relying solely on third parties. Until the second half of 2021, in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, our focus was on expanding sales of our current products, and less on new product development. In August 2021, we purchased the Glen Oaks Farms drinkable yogurt product line, and launched our drinkable oat-based kefir product line in December 2021.
 
PRODUCTION
 
Manufacturing
 
During 2022 and 2021, approximately 96% and 98% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from products manufactured at our own facilities. We currently operate the following manufacturing and distribution facilities:

· | Morton Grove, Illinois, which produces drinkable kefir, drinkable ProBugs kefir, and cheese products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Waukesha, Wisconsin, which produces drinkable kefir products and from which we store and distribute products; 
· | Niles, Illinois, which stores and serves as a distribution point for products; and 
· | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which produces drinkable kefir, cheese, and butter products, from which we store and distribute products.

 
We own these manufacturing facilities. All our fixed assets associated with manufacturing, storage, and distribution of our products are in the United States.
 
Co-Packers
 
In addition to the products manufactured in our own facilities, independent manufacturers (“co-packers”) manufacture some of our products. We have a co-packer agreement to manufacture drinkable yogurt in California. We have a co-packer agreement to manufacture drinkable kefir in Ireland, to serve our European markets. During 2022 and 2021, approximately 4% and 2% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from products manufactured by co-packers. Our domestic co-packer is Safe Quality Food (“SQF”) certified and follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Additionally, the co-packers are required to ensure our products are manufactured in accordance with our quality specifications and that they are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Sales Organization
 
We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force, brokers, and distributors. Our sales organization strives to cultivate strong, collaborative relationships with our customers that facilitate favorable shelf placement for our products, which we believe will drive sales volumes when combined with our marketing efforts and our brand strength. Our relationships with food brokers provide additional customer coverage as a supplement to our direct sales force.
 
Distribution inside the United States
 
Lifeway’s products reach the consumer through three primary “route-to-market” pathways:
 

· | Retail-direct; 
--+-------------------------------
· | Distributor; and 
· | Direct store delivery (“DSD”).

 
Under the retail-direct channel, we sell our products to retailers and deliver it through either the retailers’ carriers or third-party carriers that deliver to such retailers’ distribution centers. In turn, our retailers then deliver the products to their respective stores. Customers in this route-to-market grouping include Kroger, Walmart and Trader Joe’s. Under the retail direct-model, optimal product merchandising, assortment and product presentation are attended to by the retailer. Sales to our retail-direct customers represent approximately 50% of our total net sales for the year ended 2022.
 
Under the distributor channel, we sell our products to distributors and deliver it through either the distributors’ carriers or third-party carriers that deliver to such distributors’ designated warehouses. In turn, our distributors then sell and ship our products to their retail customers. Our distributors often use a DSD model of their own to make deliveries directly to individual stores, but they also make deliveries to retailers’ distribution centers. Our distributor customers include United Natural Foods (UNFI), KeHE Distributors, and C&S Wholesale Grocers. The distributor attends to optimal product merchandising, assortment, and product presentations at the retail end of the channel, with support from Lifeway’s direct sales force and broker network. Sales to our distributor customers represented approximately 48% of our total net sales for year ended 2022.
 
Under the direct store delivery (DSD) route to market, we sell our products to retailers and deliver it directly to the store using Company-owned vehicles and a team of Lifeway merchandisers who engage face-to-face with store management to ensure optimal product assortments and presentations. We operate our DSD model in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area only. Sales to our DSD customers represent approximately 2% of our total net sales for the year ended 2022.
 
Distribution outside of the U.S. 
 
Substantially all of Lifeway’s products are distributed within the United States; however, certain of our distributors sell our products to retailers in Mexico and portions of South America and the Caribbean. Additionally, Lifeway products reach consumers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Middle East under third party co-manufacturing agreements and in-country broker and distributor arrangements. Sales outside the United States represented approximately 1% of net sales for the year ended 2022.

Channel- and Market-Specific Distribution and Broker Representation Arrangements
 
Lifeway’s generally standardized agreements with independent distributors and food brokers allow us the latitude to establish new relationships as opportunities and needs arise. Where appropriate given the relationship, market, and business opportunity, we offer exclusive channels, markets, and/or territories to our distributors and brokers.
 
We provide our independent distributors with products at wholesale prices for distribution to their retail accounts. Lifeway believes that the prices at which we sell our products to distributors are competitive with the prices generally paid by distributors for similar products in the markets served. Due to the perishable nature of our products and the costs to return, we do not offer return privileges to any of our distributors or channel customers; however, from time to time we do provide our customers with allowances for non-saleable product.
 
Lifeway engages independent food brokers generally on a commission basis, subject in some cases to a minimum commission guarantee. The commissions vary based on the scope of services provided and customers served. Our brokers represent our products to a variety of prospective buyers. These buyers could be specialty stores, retail grocery chains, wholesalers, foodservice operators and distributors, drug chains, mass merchandisers, industrial users, schools and universities, or military installations. With support from our direct sales force, brokers may provide other value-added services. These may include scheduling and coordinating promotions, merchandising, centralized ordering, and data collection services.
 
MARKETING
 
We use a combination of sales incentives, trade promotions, and consumer promotions to market our products.
 
Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances
 
Lifeway offers various sales incentives and trade promotional programs to its retailer and distributor customers from time to time in the normal course of business. These sales incentives and trade promotion programs typically include rebates, in-store display and demo allowances, allowances for non-saleable product, coupons, and other trade promotional activities. Trade promotions support price features, displays, and other merchandising of our products by our retail and distributor customers. We record these arrangements as a reduction to net sales in our consolidated statements of operations.
Consumer Promotions and Marketing Campaigns
 
We engage in an ongoing and wide variety of marketing and media campaigns – primarily digital and social media, print advertising, television advertising, and event marketing. We complement these marketing and media efforts with industry-related trade shows and in-store promotional events. Our consumer marketing efforts also include cooperative advertising programs with our retail customers and various couponing campaigns, online consumer relationship programs, and other similar forms of promotions.
 
Our marketing efforts are aimed at stimulating demand with new and existing consumers by elevating awareness and consumption of kefir and probiotics, as well as enhancing our brand equity. Our awareness marketing seeks to promote the positive nutritional attributes and flavor of our products.
 
COMPETITION
 
Lifeway competes with a limited number of other domestic kefir producers and consequently faces a small amount of direct competition for kefir products. However, Lifeway’s kefir-based products compete with other dairy products, such as spoonable and drinkable yogurt, and, increasingly, with non-dairy probiotic products. Many of our competitors are well-established and have significantly greater financial resources than Lifeway to promote their products.

SUPPLIERS
 
We purchase our ingredients such as milk, pectin, and other ingredients from unaffiliated suppliers. In addition, we purchase significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas and electricity to operate our facilities. Purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts, and price, delivery terms, and product specifications vary. Although the prices for our principal inputs can fluctuate based on economic, weather, and other conditions, Lifeway believes it has ready access to alternative suppliers for all critical ingredients, packaging, and other input requirements.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers collectively accounted for approximately 22% of our total net sales. Two customers collectively accounted for approximately 28% of net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.
SEGMENTS
 
Lifeway has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how our chief operating decision maker manages the business and, in a manner, consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing Company performance, has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer. Substantially all our consolidated revenues relate to the sale of cultured dairy products that we produce using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a common network of distributors and retailers in the United States.
DANONE SA
 
Since October 1999, Danone SA, through subsidiaries (collectively “Danone”), has been the beneficial owner of approximately 24% of the outstanding common stock of Lifeway. Lifeway and Danone are parties to a Stockholders’ Agreement dated October 1, 1999, which as amended provides Danone the right to designate one director nominee, provides Danone with anti-dilutive rights relating to certain future offerings and issuances of capital stock, and grants Danone limited registration rights.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We believe that our rights in our trademarks and service marks are important to our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brand from our competitors and are a valuable part of our business. We own many domestic and international trademarks and service marks. In addition, we own numerous registered and unregistered copyrights, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, trade dress, technology, know-how, processes, and other proprietary rights that are not registered. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We also have licenses to use certain trademarks inside and outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. Lifeway’s policy is to pursue registration of intellectual property whenever appropriate. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade dress, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and domain name dispute resolution systems; as well as licensing agreements, third-party confidentiality, nondisclosure, and assignment agreements; and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual property. We regard the Lifeway family of trademarks and other intellectual property as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. The loss of such protection would have a material adverse impact on our operations and share price.

REGULATION
 
Lifeway is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities. In the United States, agencies governing the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of our products include, among others, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and their state and local equivalents. Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe, among other things, the requirements and standards for quality, safety, and representation of our products to consumers. We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our products and production. For example, as required by the National Organic Program (“NOP”), we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Additionally, our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
 
Internationally, we are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom; the National Service of Health, Food Safety and Agro-Food Quality (known by its Spanish-language acronym “SENASICA”) and the Federal Commission for the Protection from Sanitary Risks (“COFEPRIS”) in Mexico; the Food Safety Authority in Ireland; and the European Food Safety Authority, which supports the European Commission, as well as individual country, province, state, and local regulations.
 
Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
 
MILK INDUSTRY REGULATION
 
Our primary raw material is milk. The federal government establishes minimum prices for raw milk purchased in federally regulated areas. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices. The federal government announces prices for raw milk each month. While we are subject to federal government regulations that establish minimum prices for milk, and we also pay producer (“over-order”) premiums, federal order administration costs, and other related charges that vary by milk product, location, and supplier.
FOOD SAFETY
 
Lifeway takes appropriate precautions to ensure the safety of our products. In addition to routine inspections by state and federal regulatory agencies, including the USDA and FDA, we have instituted Company-wide quality systems that address topics such as supplier control; ingredient, packaging, and product specifications; preventive maintenance; pest control; and sanitation. Each of our facilities also has in place a hazard analysis critical control points (“HACCP”) plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards. To the extent that the federal Food Safety Modernization Act applies to Lifeway’s business, we develop food safety plans and implement preventive measures to protect against food contamination. We also maintain a product recall plan, including lot identifiability and traceability measures that allow us to act quickly to reduce the risk of consumption of any product that we suspect may pose a health issue.
 
We maintain various types of insurance, including product liability and product recall coverages, which we believe to be sufficient to cover potential product liabilities.
 
We have also implemented the SQF program at our Illinois and Wisconsin facilities. SQF is a fully integrated food safety and quality management protocol designed specifically for the food sector. The SQF Code, based on universally accepted CODEX Alimentarius, HACCP guidelines and the Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”) standards, offers a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality simultaneously. SQF certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with international, regulatory and other specified standards.
