We believe our broad portfolio and roadmap align us with the long-term trends of the healthcare market to manage patients across the continuum of care while helping to control costs and improve patient outcomes.
Operating Segments
In 2018, we managed our business as two operating segments: Automation and Analytics, and Medication Adherence:

• | Automation and Analytics. The Automation and Analytics segment is organized around the design, manufacturing, selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems, pharmacy inventory management systems and related software and services. Our Automation and Analytics products are designed to enable our customers to improve the effectiveness of the medication-use process and the efficiency of the medical-surgical supply chain, and contribute to better patient care and financial outcomes of medical facilities. The products in this segment are sold primarily to acute care (hospital) facilities. Over 5,000 healthcare facilities worldwide use our automation and analytics solutions. 


• | Medication Adherence. The Medication Adherence segment primarily includes the development, manufacturing and selling of solutions to assist patients in becoming and remaining adherent to their medication regimens. These solutions comprise a variety of tools and aids that may be directly used by a pharmacist or a healthcare provider in their direct care for a patient, or used by patients themselves. Products include software-based systems, medication adherence packaging, equipment for fulfilling the packaging and ancillary products and services. These products, which are sold under the brand names SureMed® and Omnicell, are used to manage medication administration outside of the hospital setting. Our innovative medication adherence solutions are used by over 40,000 institutional and retail pharmacies worldwide.

Business Strategy
We are committed to our vision of improving healthcare for everyone. In support of our vision, we continue to pursue the following key business strategies:

• | Development of a differentiated platform. We intend to continue our focus on further penetrating existing markets through technological leadership and our differentiated platform by consistently innovating our product and service offerings and maintaining our customer-oriented product installation process. We have developed numerous technologies that solve significant challenges for our customers. For example, our XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System is designed to allow pharmacies to more fully automate medication dispensing, and help to reduce labor cost, decrease medication waste, and improve patient safety; our IVX Workflow solution is 

6

designed to reduce medication compounding errors compared to manual compounding methods; and our Performance Center offering leverages predictive analytics to help pharmacies be more proactive in addressing drug shortages.

• | Delivery of our solutions to new markets. We seek to increase penetration of new markets, such as non-acute care and international markets by: launching new products and technologies that are specific to the needs of those markets; building and establishing direct sales, distribution or other capabilities when and where it is appropriate; partnering with companies that have sales, distribution, or other capabilities that we do not possess; and increasing customer awareness of safety issues in the administration of medications. Consistent with this strategy, we have made investments in expanding our sales team and marketing to new customers. Our international efforts have focused primarily on two markets: Western Europe and the Middle East. We have also expanded our sales efforts to medication adherence customers in the United States. 


• | Expansion of our solutions through acquisitions and partnerships. We believe that expansion of our product lines through acquisitions and partnerships to meet our customers’ changing and evolving expectations is a key component to our historical and future success. Building on the successful acquisitions of the past few years, we intend to continue to explore acquisition and partnership opportunities that are a strategic fit for our business, including in support of our Autonomous Pharmacy vision described above. We have also developed relationships with major providers of hospital information management systems with the goal of enhancing the interoperability of our products with their systems. 

Industry Background and Market
We believe our solutions and our vision for the future of medication management automation are strongly aligned with trends in the healthcare market and well positioned to address the evolving needs of healthcare institutions.
The healthcare industry continues to experience a significant degree of consolidation, with healthcare providers combining to create larger healthcare delivery organizations in order to achieve greater market power. We believe this trend has increased the market need for more integrated medication management automation solutions on a single platform to help improve patient and financial outcomes for both inpatient and outpatient settings. Our portfolio of products and strategic roadmap are designed with this objective in mind.
In addition, healthcare providers and facilities are affected by significant economic pressures. Annual cost of medicines in the United States reached approximately $450 billion in 2017, according to a report published by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science in 2018. In addition, based on a 2016 report by National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, pharmaceutical costs have substantially outpaced general inflation in recent years. Rising costs of labor, prescription drugs, and new medical technology all contribute to increased spending. Governmental pressures surrounding healthcare reform have led to increased scrutiny of the cost and efficiency with which healthcare providers deliver their services. These factors, combined with continuing consolidation in the healthcare industry, have increased the need for the efficient delivery of healthcare in order to control costs, and have elevated the strategic importance of medication management across the continuum of care.
Furthermore, substantial increases in healthcare administration highlight the need for more complete medication management solutions to help drive efficiency and improve patient safety. The number of healthcare administrators grew approximately 3,000% from 1970 to 2016, substantially outpacing the growth in physicians over the same period, according to a statistic derived by the Physicians for a National Health Program using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Health Statistics, and the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. Over time, complexities in medication management have increased along with the volume of patients and medications, but many manual processes are still used, resulting in inefficient tracking and delivery of medication supplies despite the substantial growth in administration staff. Even with the vast increase in administrative positions, many clinical staff are burdened with administrative tasks themselves. According to a survey conducted by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in 2015, approximately 76% of pharmacist activities are non-clinical in nature. In addition, many existing healthcare information systems are unable to support the modernization of healthcare delivery processes or address mandated patient safety initiatives. These factors contribute to medical errors and unnecessary process costs across the healthcare sector.
Legislation and industry guidelines, such as those produced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, The Joint Commission, the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices in the areas of medication management - including storage, security and labeling - have created an environment of increased patient safety awareness and regulatory control. Against this backdrop, healthcare organizations, desiring to improve quality and avoid liability, have been driven to prioritize investment in capital equipment, including pharmacy automation, which is a standard of care, to improve patient safety. While the overall storage and security of medications in hospitals has improved, recent years show increased 
7

focus on controlled substance management, particularly in light of the opioid crisis in the United States. According to a research report published by the Butler Center for Research in 2015, studies in the United States have shown that 10% to 15% of healthcare professionals will misuse substances during their lifetime, with significantly higher levels of opioid abuse in particular. Joint Commission surveyors are seeking more documentation from hospitals demonstrating that their medication policies and procedures are adequate.
Medication non-adherence is extremely common. Poor adherence results in increased hospital readmissions, deteriorated treatment outcomes and avoidable healthcare costs. Medication non-adherence is estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system up to $300 billion a year, according to research published in the Risk Management and Healthcare Policy Journal in 2014. In addition, a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association found that medication issues are responsible for 26% of hospital readmissions. With more than 38 million Americans taking five or more maintenance medications routinely (based on statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2017), pharmacists need ways to support the arduous task of keeping patients compliant. According to a 2011 article by the World Health Organization, “although these medications are effective in combating disease, their full benefits are often not realized because approximately 50% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed.” Medication adherence can be improved through attitudinal and behavioral changes, which pharmacists can encourage and help facilitate by providing interventional support, including adherence tools such as blister cards, reminders, prescription synchronization, and patient engagement tools. We believe our Medication Adherence solutions have the potential to reduce hospital readmissions and improve patient health by increasing medication adherence.
Healthcare Reform
In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Obama. The PPACA mandated a broad range of programs to improve access to care, slow the growth of healthcare spending and improve the quality of healthcare. Even though the future of PPACA continues to be unclear under the current administration, the need for increased efficiency in order to provide high-quality healthcare at a lower cost remains a key objective of healthcare systems. Accordingly, in our annual tracking of pharmacy and nursing leadership mindshare, operational efficiency in medication distribution and administration continues to be a top priority.
We believe our products help healthcare organizations leverage and enhance their investments in electronic health record (“EHR”) implementation and integration by allowing them to reduce process steps, eliminate manual tracking and waste, enable population-level performance insights, track quality levels and reduce errors that result in unnecessary cost. By harnessing data provided by our automation systems via our cloud platform and translating them into actionable insights via solutions such as the Omnicell Performance Center, we help enable our customers to optimize the pharmacy supply chain and lower costs.
Products and Services
As we execute on our vision of the Autonomous Pharmacy, we plan to integrate our current offerings and technologies on cloud infrastructure, and invest in broadening our solutions across three key areas:

• | Automation - We provide a range of advanced automation, including robotics, designed to digitize and streamline workflows and reduce human error in central pharmacy and clinical areas, and to support medication adherence initiatives in retail pharmacies.


• | Intelligence - Through data analytics and predictive intelligence, we provide actionable insights to help customers better understand their medication usage and improve pharmacy supply chain management.


• | Work - We provide expert services that serve as an extension of pharmacy operations to support improved efficiency, regulatory compliance and patient outcomes.

Automation and Analytics Products and Services
Our Automation and Analytics products and services include central pharmacy automation solutions, IV compounding systems, and medication and supply dispensing systems, as well as analytics solutions and services.
Central Pharmacy Automation
An efficient central pharmacy operation is vital to delivering exceptional patient care. With pharmacist and technician labor requirements increasing over the years, it is critical for pharmacies to find new ways of increasing productivity. Our broad medication management platform offers a range of automated hardware and software solutions. Our central pharmacy automation is designed to empower healthcare providers to increase staff efficiency, reduce inventory costs, prevent medication 
8

errors, improve compliance and tighten security of controlled substances. By automating manual, error-prone processes, our technology helps enable pharmacy staff to work more efficiently and directly contribute to clinical care.
Our central pharmacy automation solutions include: automated storage and retrieval systems, including our XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System - an important building block of our Autonomous Pharmacy vision; IV compounding robots and workflow management systems; inventory management software; and controlled substance management systems.
Clinician Workflow
Omnicell automation is designed to improve clinician workflow in patient care areas of the healthcare systems, such as nursing units, operating rooms, and emergency departments. Automated dispensing systems are an essential part of medication management because they safeguard medications - including controlled substances - and automatically track inventory. We strive to continually develop new innovations for our automated dispensing cabinet system to close gaps in safety and help enable clinicians to spend less time managing medications and more time caring for patients.
Our automated dispensing cabinets (including our XT Series, G4, and AcuDose-RxTM) for medications and supplies used in nursing units and other clinical areas of the hospital can be customized with various software and hardware options. Our interoperability solutions integrate our automated dispensing system with key EHR systems to streamline workflow and increase accuracy. We also offer specialized automated dispensing cabinets for the operating room. 
Intelligence Solutions
We offer specialized services and analytics software designed to help healthcare facilities improve their bottom line and patient care by harnessing data from automation and other systems. Our analytics solutions include analytics software that provides a more efficient and effective way to monitor potential drug diversion and address inventory management issues. In addition, the Omnicell Performance Center combines a cloud-based predictive intelligence platform with expert services designed to monitor pharmacy operations and recommend opportunities to help improve efficiency, regulatory compliance and patient outcomes.

Retail Pharmacy and Hospital Automation Outside the United States
Additional products sold outside the United States include robotic dispensing systems used in hospitals and retail pharmacies for handling the stocking and retrieval of boxed medications. For managing medical supplies, a specialized cabinet that uses radio frequency identification is also available.
Medication Adherence Products and Services
Our Medication Adherence solutions are used by retail, community and outpatient pharmacies as well as by institutional pharmacies serving long-term care and other sites outside the acute care hospital. Products in this segment include consumable adherence packaging, packaging equipment, software-based patient engagement and communication tools and ancillary products and services, each designed to improve patient engagement and adherence to prescriptions.
Adherence Packaging
We offer a wide range of medication blister card packaging and packaging supplies designed to enhance medication adherence in a variety of non-acute care settings. These products include multimed blister cards (adherence packaging) distributed by retail, community, and outpatient pharmacies to help patients manage their medication regimens at home. These cards organize multiple drugs into a single blister cavity for each dosing time, helping to make it easier for patients on complex regimens to comply with their therapy. 
For environments where a caregiver is present, institutional and retail pharmacies use our single dose blister cards, which provide up to 90-day doses of a specific single medication.
9

Multimed Automation
We offer automated systems (including our VBM 200F Multimed Automation solution) to aid pharmacies in more accurately and efficiently filling our multimed adherence packaging based on individual patient medication orders. These machines interface with pharmacy information systems to obtain prescription information for each patient receiving the blister cards. Automating the fulfillment process enables pharmacies to more easily expand adherence packaging to more patients, which can help increase their revenue.
In addition to robotic automation, we offer software that guides the user through the manual filling process to streamline workflow and increase packing accuracy.
Single Dose Automation
Single dose automation fills and labels a variety of patient-specific, single-dose blister packaging based on incoming prescriptions. Our semi-automated filling equipment is designed specifically for the long-term care institutional pharmacy with enough order volume to warrant pre-packaging frequently-used medications. Our automated solutions interface with pharmacy information systems to obtain prescription information.
Population Health Solutions
Omnicell Patient Engagement - part of our broader population health portfolio - supports improving patient adherence through a single, web-based platform that hosts functionality to guide and track patient notes, interventions and appointments. The platform provides the pharmacy with a holistic view of patients, not only by organizing prescriptions, but by identifying, preparing and documenting ongoing patient engagement. It uses predictive analytics to prioritize patient interventions. Omnicell Patient Engagement is a subscription-based software system that includes services such as Omnicell Medication Synchronization, Omnicell Medication Therapy Management, and a number of tools used by clinicians to manage patient engagement workflows.
We also offer patient communication tools such as interactive voice response to further help pharmacies drive revenue growth through increased patient engagement.
In the United Kingdom, we offer electronic Medication Administration Record software for use in nursing homes.
Acquisitions
In addition to our own development, we have, from time to time acquired products that extend patient safety controls to a wider range of applications and departments in and out of the hospital setting. 
In April 2017, we completed the acquisition of InPharmics, a provider of advanced pharmacy informatics solutions to hospital pharmacies. The InPharmics solutions add clinical and compliance analytics to Omnicell’s Performance Center offering, positioning us as a leading partner for health systems seeking to improve all facets of medication management.
In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of Ateb, a leading provider of pharmacy-based patient care solutions and medication synchronization to independent and chain retail pharmacies, an area where we had no prior market penetration. Ateb’s integrated medication synchronization program, combined with Omnicell’s SureMed medication adherence packaging and related automation solutions, uniquely positions us to support pharmacists as they implement and scale their medication adherence programs.    
In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of Aesynt, a leader in central pharmacy robotics and IV compounding automation. We added these two solution sets to the Omnicell portfolio to give us one of the most comprehensive medication management platform offerings in the industry. With the addition of central pharmacy robotics and IV compounding, we are now able to support customers who desire a centralized cartfill or nurse server medication distribution model all the way to fully decentralized dispensing and hybrid combinations along that continuum. We are also able to offer solutions for preparing IV compounds, including oncology drugs, which is an area where our combined customers have expressed significant interest.    
Sales and Distribution
We sell our Automation and Analytics and Medication Adherence solutions primarily in the United States. Approximately 87% of our revenue was generated in this market for the year ended December 31, 2018. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. Our sales force is organized by geographic region in the United States and Canada where our sales are primarily made direct to end-user customers with the exception of some distribution of Medication Adherence consumables. Outside the United States and Canada, we field direct sales employees in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Belgium, and Australia. For other geographies, we generally sell through distributors and resellers. Our foreign 
10

operations are discussed in Note 14, Segment and Geographical Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this annual report. Our combined direct, corporate, and international distribution sales teams consisted of approximately 285 staff members as of December 31, 2018. Nearly all of our direct sales team members have hospital capital equipment or clinical systems experience. 
The sales cycle for our automation systems, from the initial sales meeting to completion of installation, is long and can take in excess of 12 to 22 months. This is due in part to the relative cost of our systems and the number of people within each healthcare facility involved in the purchasing decision and installation process. To initiate the selling process, the sales representative generally targets the director of pharmacy, the director of nursing, the director of materials management or other decision makers and is responsible for educating each group within the healthcare facility about the economic, safety, and compliance benefits of our solutions relative to competing methods of managing medications or medical and surgical supplies.
We contract with Group Purchasing Organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. Pursuant to the terms of GPO agreements, each member contracts directly with us and can purchase our product at pre-negotiated contract terms and pricing. These GPO contracts are typically for multiple years with options to renew or extend for up to two years and some of which can be terminated by either party at any time. Our significant current GPO contracts include HealthTrust Purchasing Group, Intalere (f.k.a. Amerinet, Inc.), Premier Inc., The Resource Group, Resource Optimization & Innovation, LLC, and Vizient, Inc. We have also contracted with the U.S. General Services Administration, allowing the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense and other Federal government customers to purchase or lease our products. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, sales to members of the ten largest GPOs accounted for approximately 59% of total consolidated revenue. 
We offer multi-year, non-cancelable lease payment terms to assist healthcare organizations in purchasing our systems by reducing their cash flow requirements. We sell the majority of our multi-year lease receivables to third‑party leasing finance companies.
Our field operations representatives support our sales force by providing operational and clinical expertise prior to the close of a sale and during installation of our automation systems. This group assists the customer with the technical implementation of our automation systems, including configuring our systems to address the specific needs of each individual customer. After the systems are installed, on-site support is provided by our field service team and technical support group.
We offer telephone technical support through our technical support centers in Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Our support centers are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We have found that a majority of our customers’ service issues can be addressed either over the phone or by our support center personnel using their remote diagnostics tools. In addition, we use remote dial-in software that monitors customer conditions on a daily basis. We offer a suite of remote monitoring features, which proactively monitors system status and alerts service personnel to potential problems before they lead to system failure.
In addition, our international team handles direct sales, installation and service to healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and to non-acute customers in Australia. Sales, installation and service to healthcare facilities is handled through distribution partners in other parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. Our products are available in a variety of languages including Mandarin, French, Swedish, Dutch, Spanish, Turkish, and German.
We have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State, or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls.
Manufacturing and Inventory
The manufacturing process for our Automation and Analytics products allows us to configure hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer needs. The Automation and Analytics product manufacturing process primarily consists of the final assembly of components and testing of the completed product. Many of the subassemblies and components we use are provided by third-party contract manufacturers or other suppliers. We and our partners test these subassemblies and perform inspections to assure the quality and reliability of our products. While many components of our systems are standardized and available from multiple sources, certain components or subsystems are fabricated by a sole supplier according to our specifications and schedule requirements. Our Medication Adherence product manufacturing process consists of fabrication and assembly of equipment and mechanized process manufacturing of consumables. 
11

Our arrangements with our contract manufacturers generally set forth quality, cost and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply, inventory management, capacity flexibility, quality and cost management, oversight of manufacturing and conditions for the use of our intellectual property.
Our manufacturing organization procures components and schedules production based on the backlog of customer orders. Installation of equipment and software typically occurs between two weeks and twelve months after the initial order is received, depending upon the customer’s particular needs. We deploy a key operational strategy of operating with backlog levels that approximate the average installation cycle of our customers, which allows us to more efficiently manage our installation teams, improve production efficiencies, reduce inventory scrap and lower shipping costs. Shipment of consumables typically occurs between one and fourteen days after an order is received.
Competition 
The medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of companies and are affected by evolving and new technologies, changes in industry standards and dynamic customer requirements.
Our current direct competitors in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include Becton, Dickinson and Company (through its acquisition of CareFusion Corporation); ARxIUM; Cerner Corporation; Swisslog Healthcare as a division of KUKA; TouchPoint Medical, Inc.; Cardinal Health, Inc.; PAR Excellence Systems, Inc.; TECSYS Inc.; Kit Check, Inc.; Infor, Inc.; Baxter Healthcare Corporation; Grifols, S.A. (through its acquisition of MedKeeper); Willach Pharmacy Solutions; DIH Technologies Corporation; Yuyama Co., Ltd; RoboPharma B.V.; Meditech-Pharma; Knapp AG; KLS Steuerungstechnik GmbH; and Gollmann Kommissioniersysteme GmbH. Our current direct competitors in the medication adherence solutions market include Drug Package, Inc.; ARxIUM; Manchac Technologies, LLC; RX Systems, Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Digital Pharmacist Inc.; PrescribeWellness; Synergy Medical Systems; and TCGRx in the United States, and Jones Packaging Ltd.; Synergy Medical Systems; Medicine-on-Time, LLC; Global Factories B.V.; and WebsterCare outside the United States. 
We believe our products and services compare favorably with the offerings of our competitors, particularly with respect to proprietary technological advancements, system performance, system reliability, installation, applications training, service response time, and service repair quality.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual restrictions, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights.
We pursue patent protection in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary and that offers a potential competitive advantage for our products. Our issued patents expire at various dates between 2019 and 2036. We intend to seek and obtain additional United States and foreign patents on our technology. 
All of our product software is subject to copyright protection under applicable United States and foreign copyright laws. 
We intend to seek and obtain registration of our trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We have obtained United States and, for certain marks, foreign registrations of, among others, the following marks Omnicell, the Omnicell logo, OmniCenter, SafetyStock, SinglePointe, OnDemand, SureMed, AccuFlex, Ateb, Detect-Rx, Time My Meds, Pharmacy Line, InPharmics, Aesynt, Connect-Rx, MedCarousel, ROBOT-Rx, and Health Robotics. 
Trade secrets and other confidential information are also important to our business. We protect our trade secrets through a combination of contractual restrictions and confidentiality and licensing agreements.
Research and Development 
We use industry standard operating systems and databases, but generally develop our own application and interface software in our research and development facilities. New product development projects are prioritized based on customer input. Research and development takes place in Mountain View, California; Cranberry Woods, Pennsylvania; St. Petersburg, Florida; Bochum, Germany; Beijing, China; Lancing, UK; and Trieste, Italy. Research and development expenses were $64.8 million, $66.0 million, and $57.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.
12

Employees 
We had approximately 2,480 employees as of December 31, 2018. We have rebalanced our staff as needed, at times eliminating some functional positions and at other times adding new functional-specific positions to meet the evolving needs of the business. To our knowledge, none of our domestic employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Business under Government Contracts
A number of our U.S. government‑owned or government-run hospital customers sign five-year leases, with payment terms that are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. Failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers, or to collect payments on our existing unsold leases. For additional information regarding these leases, see the section titled “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item 1A below.
Financing Practices Relating to Working Capital
We assist healthcare facilities in financing their cash outlay requirements for the purchase of our systems by offering multi-year, non-cancelable sales contracts. For additional information regarding these financing activities, see Note 1, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.
Product Backlog
Product backlog is the dollar amount of medication and supply dispensing systems for which we have purchase orders from our customers and for which we believe we generally will install, bill and gain customer acceptance generally within one year. Due to industry practice that allows customers to change order configurations with limited advance notice prior to shipment and occasional customer changes in installation schedules, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of future sales. However, we do believe that backlog is an indication of a customer’s willingness to install our solutions. Our product backlog was $478 million and $345 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
