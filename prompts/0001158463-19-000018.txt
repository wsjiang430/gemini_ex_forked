ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
General
JetBlue Airways Corporation, or JetBlue, is New York's Hometown Airline®. In 2018, JetBlue carried over 42 million Customers with an average of 1,000 daily flights and served 105 destinations in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America.
JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 and commenced service on February 11, 2000. As of the end of 2018, we were the sixth largest passenger carrier in the U.S. based on available seat miles, or ASMs. We believe our differentiated product and culture combined with our competitive cost structure enables us to compete effectively in the high-value geographies we serve. Looking to the future, we plan to continue to grow in our high-value geographies, invest in industry leading products and provide award winning service by our more than 22,000 dedicated employees, whom we refer to as Crewmembers. Going forward, we believe we will continue to differentiate ourselves from other airlines, enabling us to continue to attract a greater mix of Customers, and to drive further profitable growth. We are focused on delivering solid results for our Shareholders, our Customers, and our Crewmembers. 
 As used in this Report, the terms “JetBlue,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to JetBlue Airways Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal executive offices are located at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, Long Island City, New York 11101 and our telephone number is (718) 286-7900. 
Our Industry and Competition
The U.S. airline industry is extremely competitive, challenging and results are often volatile. It is uniquely susceptible to external factors such as fuel costs, downturns in domestic and international economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, the impact of airline restructurings or consolidations, and military actions or acts of terrorism. We operate in a capital and energy intensive industry that has high fixed costs, as well as heavy taxation and fees. Airline returns are sensitive to slight changes in fuel prices, average fare levels, and passenger demand. The industry's principal competitive factors include fares, brand and customer service, route networks, flight schedules, aircraft types, safety records, code-sharing and interline relationships, in-flight entertainment and connectivity systems, and frequent flyer programs. 
Price competition is intense in our industry. Our ability to operate successfully and grow in this environment depends on, among other things, our ability to operate at costs equal to or lower than our competitors.
Since 2001, the majority of traditional network airlines have undergone significant financial restructuring including bankruptcies, mergers and consolidations. These types of restructurings typically result in a lower cost structure through a reduction of labor costs, restructuring of commitments including debt terms, leases and aircraft, modification or termination of pension plans, increased workforce flexibility, and innovative offerings. These actions also have provided the restructured airlines significant opportunities for realignment of route networks, alliances, and frequent flyer programs. Each factor has had a significant influence on the industry's improved profitability. 
 2018 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
We believe our differentiated product and culture, competitive costs, and high-value geography relative to other airlines contributed to our continued success in 2018. Our 2018 operational highlights include:
•Product enhancements - Throughout 2018, we continued to invest in industry-leading products which we believe will continue to differentiate our offerings from the other airlines. 
◦During 2018, we continued to expand Mint® service, our premium product which includes 16 fully lie-flat seats, four of which are in suites with a privacy door, a first in the U.S. domestic market, by adding seasonal service from John F. Kennedy International Airport, or JFK, to Liberia, Costa Rica, and from Boston to St. Lucia. Liberia is our first city in Latin America with Mint® service and we are the only airline to operate regularly scheduled flights with a lie-flat premium seat between Costa Rica and the U.S. 
◦In April 2018, we unveiled our first Airbus A320 aircraft with a restyled cabin which includes 162 new seats, larger TV screens with over 100 channels of free DIRECTV®, and free gate-to-gate Fly-Fi®. As of December 31, 2018, we had nine restyled Airbus A320 aircraft in service. We expect the restyling of the entire Airbus A320 fleet to be completed by late 2020 and believe this multi-year restyling program will allow us to increase capacity in a capital-efficient and customer-focused way.

◦In June 2018, we announced the next step in our ongoing digital transformation with the launch of a redesigned jetblue.com. Our new website features a fresh look, homepage global navigation, and performance that is optimized to the screen size of a user's device. A new navigation interface allows Customers to more easily find the information they need and a focus on the booking experience highlights the breadth of travel options available when booking through jetblue.com. 
◦As part of our ongoing digital transformation, we revealed a new Points Pooling™ program for our TrueBlue® members. Points Pooling™ allows designated groups to conveniently earn and redeem points together, providing more flexibility to our Customers. 
◦In partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), we rolled out our first fully-integrated biometric self-boarding gate at JFK. Customers flying to select international destinations from Terminal 5 can now board with a dual-lane biometric self-boarding gate, which uses facial recognition technology to verify travelers with a quick photo capture.
•Fleet - During 2018, we took delivery of ten Airbus A321 aircraft, three of which were equipped with our Mint® cabin layout. 
We anticipate that we will take delivery of a minimum of six Airbus A321new engine option (neo) aircraft in 2019.
In July 2018, we announced an order for 60 Airbus A220-300 aircraft, previously called the Bombardier CS300, for expected deliveries beginning in 2020 through 2025, with the option for 60 additional aircraft though 2028. The order followed our intensive review aimed at ensuring the best financial performance of the airline's fleet while providing maximum flexibility to execute our network strategy and enhance the customer experience. In conjunction with the new order, we also reshaped our Airbus order book, which included converting our order for 25 A320 neo aircraft to the A321neo and adjusting our delivery schedule. We have the option to take certain A321neo deliveries with the long range configuration, the A321-LR.
We plan to phase in the A220-300 as a replacement for our existing fleet of 60 Embraer E190 aircraft. We believe the A220-300 range and seating capacity will add flexibility to our network as we target growth in our focus cities, including options to schedule it for transcontinental flying. We expect to incur incremental one-time costs as we work to transition the Embraer E190 aircraft out of our fleet.
While the Embraer E190 has played an important role in our network since 2005, we determined during our fleet review that the A220-300's economics would allow us to lower costs in the coming years. The A220-300 was designed by the previous manufacturer, Bombardier, to seat between 130 and 160 passengers, enabling financial and network advantages over the current 100-seat Embraer E190 configuration.
We expect to begin reducing flying with our existing fleet of Embraer E190 aircraft beginning in 2020. The phase out is expected to continue gradually through approximately 2025.
Options for 60 additional A220-300 aircraft deliveries are anticipated to begin in 2025 and we would retain the flexibility to convert certain aircraft to the smaller A220-100 model. Both members of the A220 family share commonality in more than 99 percent of their replaceable parts and utilize the same family of engines.
•Network - We continued to expand and grow in our high-value geography. In 2018, we expanded our network with four new BlueCities, bringing our total as of the end of December 2018 to 105 BlueCities, and added several connect-the-dot routes. 
We began service in May 2018 from Boston to Minneapolis, our 102nd BlueCity. Minneapolis became the 65th nonstop destination from Boston. 
As part of our broader series of network enhancements designed to better meet the needs of coast-to-coast travelers, we expanded our metropolitan Los Angeles service with nonstop flights between Ontario and JFK in September 2018. Ontario is our tenth city served in California and the 73rd nonstop destination from JFK.
In December 2018, we launched seasonal service to Steamboat Springs, Colorado with three nonstop routes connecting the internationally-known resort destination with three of our focus cities: Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, and Long Beach. JetBlue is the only airline to fly nonstop from Steamboat Springs to both Boston and South Florida.
We also launched our first-ever scheduled service to Montana in December 2018 with seasonal flights between Bozeman and Long Beach. Our service to Bozeman allows us to grow further in the western United States. 
In February 2019, we plan to begin daily roundtrip services from Fort Lauderdale to Guayaquil, Ecuador. Guayaquil will become our sixth destination in South America, second in Ecuador and expands our broader reach into Latin America and the Caribbean.
4

In October 2018, we announced a series of network changes that will advance our strategy in multiple focus cities, making us even more relevant in key markets and ensuring our network is optimized to meet customer demand. During the winter, we introduced four new routes to our network, connecting more Customers with destinations across the route map. In addition to the new nonstop markets being introduced, we also increased flights on nearly two dozen of our most popular and profitable existing nonstop routes in the Northeast, Florida, and the Caribbean. Approximately two-thirds of the added flights will originate in Boston or Fort Lauderdale. To support new city and multi-route expansions, we will reduce flights in some existing markets. Effective January 8, 2019, we will eliminate service in Daytona Beach International Airport, St. Croix's Henry E. Rohlsen Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. We are also scaling back flying on a number of other routes, including certain flights serving Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Santiago, Dominican Republic.
•Customer Service - JetBlue and our Crewmembers were recognized in 2018 for industry leading customer service. Airline Ratings awarded us 7 out of 7 stars for safety, and 5 out of 5 stars for our product offerings. Additionally, we were recognized by The Points Guy with awards for Best Domestic Economy Class and Best Domestic Business Class. We were the only airline, domestically and globally, to win awards for both economy and business class.
•Our Crewmembers - During 2018, our Crewmembers recognized JetBlue as one of America's "Best Employers" by Forbes. JetBlue ranked #33 through a survey that asked individuals how likely they would be to recommend their employer to someone else. We are proud that for a seventh year, we have achieved a top score of 100 on the Corporate Equality Index, which rates major U.S. companies and their policies and practices related to the LGBT community, earning us the designation of one of the "Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality."
JETBLUE EXPERIENCE
 We offer our Customers a distinctive flying experience which we refer to as the "JetBlue Experience''. We believe we deliver award winning service that focuses on the entire Customer experience, from booking an itinerary to arrival at the final destination. Typically, our Customers are neither high-traffic business travelers nor ultra-price sensitive travelers. Rather, we believe we are the carrier of choice for the majority of travelers who have been underserved by other airlines as we offer a differentiated product and award winning customer service. 
Differentiated Product and Culture
Delivering the JetBlue Experience to our Customers through our differentiated product and culture is core to our mission to inspire humanity. We look to attract new Customers to our brand and provide current Customers with a reason to come back by continuing to innovate and evolve the JetBlue Experience. We believe we can adapt to the changing needs of our Customers and a key element of our success is the belief that competitive fares and quality air travel need not be mutually exclusive. 
Our award winning service begins from the moment our Customers purchase a ticket through one of our distribution channels such as www.jetblue.com, our mobile applications, or our reservations centers. Customers can purchase tickets under our Fare Options pricing model, at one of three branded fares: Blue, Blue Plus, and Blue Flex. Each fare includes different offerings such as free checked bags, reduced change fees, and additional TrueBlue® points, with all fares including our core offering of free in-flight entertainment, free brand name snacks, and free non-alcoholic beverages. Customers can choose to “buy up” to an option with additional offerings. These different fares allow Customers to select the products or services they need or value when they travel, without having to pay for the things they do not need or value. 
Upon arrival at the airport, our Customers are welcomed by our dedicated Crewmembers and can choose to purchase one or more of our ancillary options such as Even More® Speed, allowing them to enjoy an expedited security experience in most domestic JetBlue locations. Customers who select our Blue Flex option or purchase a Mint® seat receive Even More® Speed as part of their fare. We additionally have mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices which have robust features including real-time flight information updates and mobile check-in for certain routes. Our applications are designed to enhance our Customers' travel experience and are in keeping with the JetBlue Experience. 
Our self-service initiative in select BlueCities redesigned the physical layout of the airport lobby and the way our Customers travel through it. Our new user-friendly kiosks are the first point of contact for each Customer traveling through the airport lobby. While all Customers are encouraged to use the kiosks, our new lobby layout allows them to choose the check-in experience they prefer. Customers who choose to use our kiosk receive a virtually queue-less experience. For Customers who prefer a more traditional experience, our Help Desk offers full-service check-in. The self-service model allows Crewmembers to get out from behind the ticket counter and move through the lobby to guide our Customers through the check-in process. The self-service lobby opens up the opportunity for our Crewmembers to make personal connections with our Customers, to assist with bag tagging, to answer Customer questions and direct them to their next step in the travel experience.

Once onboard our aircraft, Customers enjoy seats in a comfortable layout with the most legroom in the main cabin of all U.S. airlines, based on average fleet-wide seat pitch. Our Even More® Space seats are available for purchase across our fleet, giving Customers the opportunity to enjoy additional legroom. Customers on certain transcontinental or Caribbean flights have the option to purchase our premium service, Mint®, which has 16 fully lie-flat seats, including four suites with privacy doors. 
Our in-flight entertainment system onboard the majority of our Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 aircraft includes 36 channels of free DIRECTV®, 100+ channels of free SiriusXM Radio® and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Customers on our Airbus A321 aircraft and certain restyled Airbus A320 aircraft have access to 100+ channels of DIRECTV®, 100+ channels of SiriusXM Radio® and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Our Mint® Customers enjoy 15-inch flat screen televisions to experience our in-flight entertainment offerings. Our entire fleet is equipped with Fly-Fi®, a broadband product, with connectivity that we believe is significantly faster than airlines featuring KU-band satellites and older ground to air technology. Customers also have access to the Fly-Fi® Hub, a content portal where Customers can access a wide range of movies, television shows, and additional content from their own personal devices. In 2017, we became the first in the U.S. to offer gate-to-gate internet connectivity on every aircraft. Gate-to-gate Fly-Fi® eliminates the need to wait until reaching cruising altitude to get connected. Instead, Customers can email, surf, stream, tweet, and shop from the moment they board until they reach the arrival gate. 
All Customers may enjoy an assortment of free and unlimited brand name snacks and non-alcoholic beverages and have the option to purchase additional products such as blankets, pillows, headphones, premium beverages and premium food selections. Our Mint® Customers have access to an assortment of complimentary food, beverages and products including a small-plates menu, artisanal snacks, alcoholic beverages, a blanket, pillows, and headphones. 
Our Airbus A321 aircraft in a single cabin layout have 200 seats and those with our Mint® offering have 159 seats. Our Airbus A320 aircraft generally have 150 seats while our Embraer E190 aircraft have 100 seats. As part of our cabin restyling program we are increasing the seat density on our Airbus A320 fleet to 162 seats. We believe this multi-year restyling program will allow us to increase capacity in a capital-efficient and customer-focused way. Our first restyled Airbus A320 aircraft entered into revenue service in April 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had nine restyled Airbus A320 aircraft in service. 
 Because of our network strength in leisure destinations, we also sell vacation packages through JetBlue Vacations®, a one-stop, value-priced vacation service for self-directed packaged travel planning. These packages offer competitive fares for air travel on JetBlue along with a selection of JetBlue-recommended hotels and resorts, car rentals, and local attractions. In 2018, we created a standalone wholly-owned subsidiary, JetBlue Travel Products, LLC that absorbed our JetBlue Vacations® business. 
We work to provide a superior air travel experience, including communicating openly and honestly with Customers about delays and service disruptions. We are the only major U.S. airline to have a Customer Bill of Rights. This program was introduced in 2007 to provide compensation to Customers who experience inconveniences. This Customer Bill of Rights commits us to high service standards and holds us accountable if we fall short. 
In 2018, we completed 98.1% of our scheduled flights. Unlike most other airlines, we have a policy of not overbooking flights.
Our Customers have repeatedly indicated the distinctive JetBlue Experience is an important reason why they select us over other carriers. We measure and monitor customer feedback regularly which helps us to continuously improve customer satisfaction. One way we do so is by measuring our net promoter score, or NPS. This metric is used by companies in a broad range of industries to measure and monitor the customer experience. Many of the leading consumer brands that are recognized for great customer service receive high NPS scores. We believe a higher NPS score has positive effects on customer loyalty and ultimately leads to increased revenue.
Network/ High-Value Geography
We are a predominately point-to-point system carrier, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities: New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Orlando, Long Beach, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. During 2018, over 85% of our Customers flew on nonstop itineraries. 
Leisure traveler focused airlines are often faced with high seasonality. As a result, we continually work to manage our mix of Customers to include both business travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives, or VFR. VFR travelers tend to be slightly less seasonal and less susceptible to economic downturns than traditional leisure destination travelers. Understanding the purpose of our Customers' travel helps us optimize destinations, strengthen our network, and increase unit revenues. All six of our focus cities are in regions with a diverse mix of traffic. 
As of December 31, 2018, our network served 105 BlueCities in 31 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 21 countries in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
6

We also made changes across our network by announcing new routes between existing BlueCities. We group our capacity distribution based upon geographical regions rather than on a mileage or a length-of-haul basis. The historic distribution of ASMs, or capacity, by region for the years ending December 31 was:

Capacity Distribution | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Transcontinental | 31.3 | % | | 28.6 | % | 28.8 | %
Caribbean & Latin America (1) | 28.7 | | | 28.3 | | 30.1 | 
Florida | 27.3 | | | 30.1 | | 29.1 | 
East | 6.5 | | | 6.4 | | 5.4 | 
Central | 4.0 | | | 3.8 | | 4.1 | 
West | 2.2 | | | 2.8 | | 2.5 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1) Domestic operations as defined by the U.S. Department of Transport, or DOT, include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but for the purposes of the capacity distribution table above, we have included these locations in the Caribbean and Latin America region.
During the past decade we invested in our network, which had been dominated by the New York metropolitan area with approximately half of our ASMs. Our network growth over the past few years has been focused on the business traveler in Boston as well as travelers to the Caribbean and Latin America region. We expect to continue increasing our presence in Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood where we believe there is an opportunity to increase our operations to destinations throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Our plan is supported by significant investment from the Broward County Aviation Department in the airport and surrounding facilities. We believe our increased focus on Boston and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood makes our ASMs more balanced and the overall network is stronger.
In 2019, we anticipate further expanding our network and have previously announced service to the following new destination:

Destination | Service Scheduled to Commence
Guayaquil, Ecuador | February 28, 2019 

Airline Commercial Partnerships
Airlines frequently participate in commercial partnerships with other carriers in order to increase Customer convenience by providing interline-connectivity, code-sharing, coordinated flight schedules, frequent flyer program reciprocity, and other joint marketing activities. As of December 31, 2018, we had 49 airline commercial partnerships. Our commercial partnerships typically begin as an interline agreement allowing a Customer to book one itinerary with tickets on multiple airlines. During 2018, we entered into a code-sharing agreement with JetSuiteX, marking the first code-share between a semi-private public charter operator and a major U.S. carrier. This code sharing agreement provides our Customers access to flights on a variety of West Coast routes. Code-sharing is a practice by which one airline places its name and flight number on flights operated by another airline. In 2019, we expect to continue to seek additional strategic opportunities through new commercial partners as well as assess ways to deepen existing airline partnerships. We plan to do this by expanding code-share relationships and other areas of cooperation such as frequent flyer programs. We believe these commercial partnerships allow us to better leverage our strong network and drive incremental traffic and revenue while improving off-peak travel.
Marketing 
JetBlue is a widely recognized and respected global brand. JetBlue created a new category in air travel and our brand stands for high service quality at a reasonable cost. We believe this brand has evolved into an important and valuable asset which identifies us as a safe, reliable, high value airline. Similarly, we believe customer awareness of our brand has contributed to the success of our marketing efforts. It enables us to promote ourselves as a preferred marketing partner with companies across many different industries. 
We market our services through advertising and promotions in various media forms including popular social media outlets. We engage in large multi-market programs, local events and sponsorships across our route network as well as mobile marketing programs. Our targeted public and community relations efforts reflect our commitment to the communities we serve, as well as promoting brand awareness and complementing our strong reputation.

Distribution
Our primary and preferred distribution channel to Customers is through our website, www.jetblue.com, our lowest cost channel. Our website allows us to more closely control and deliver the JetBlue Experience while also offering the full suite of JetBlue Fare Options, Even More® Space and Speed, and other ancillary services. 
Our participation in global distribution systems, or GDS, supports our profitable growth, particularly in the business market. We find business Customers are more likely to book through a travel agency or a booking product which relies on a GDS platform. Although the cost of sales through this channel is higher than through our website, the average fare purchased through a GDS is generally higher and often covers the increased distribution costs. We currently participate in several major GDS and online travel agents, or OTA. Due to the majority of our Customers booking travel on our website, we maintain relatively low distribution costs despite our increased participation in GDS and OTA in recent years.
Customer Loyalty Program
TrueBlue® is our customer loyalty program designed to reward and recognize loyal Customers. Members earn points based upon the amount paid for JetBlue flights and services from certain commercial partners. Our points do not expire, the program has no black-out dates or seat restrictions, and any JetBlue destination can be booked if the TrueBlue® member has enough points to exchange for the value of an open seat. Mosaic® is an additional level for our most loyal Customers who either (1) fly a minimum of 30 times with JetBlue and acquire at least 12,000 base flight points within a calendar year or (2) accumulate 15,000 base flight points within a calendar year. Over 2 million TrueBlue® one-way redemption awards were flown during 2018, representing approximately 5% of our total revenue passenger miles. 
We currently have co-branded loyalty credit cards available to eligible U.S. residents, as well as co-brand agreements in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to allow cardholders to earn TrueBlue® points. Our current co-branded credit card partnership with Barclaycard® on the MasterCard® network exceeded expectations for conversion rates and has exceeded our expectations for new member enrollments. We also have co-branded loyalty credit cards issued by Banco Santander Puerto Rico and MasterCard® in Puerto Rico as well as Banco Popular Dominicano and MasterCard® in the Dominican Republic. These credit cards allow Customers in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to take full advantage of our TrueBlue® loyalty program. 
We have a separate agreement with American Express® that allows any American Express® cardholder to convert Membership Rewards® points into TrueBlue® points. In 2016, we added a partnership agreement with Citibank® to convert Citi ThankYou® Rewards points into TrueBlue® points. We became a Chase Ultimate Rewards® point transfer partner in 2018, allowing eligible Chase cardmembers to transfer Ultimate Rewards points to TrueBlue® points. We have various agreements with other loyalty partners, including hotels and car rental companies, that allow their customers to earn TrueBlue® points through participation in our partners’ programs. Customers can link their TrueBlue® account with Lyft, to take advantage of unique discounts, travel perks, and earn TrueBlue® loyalty points on any Lyft ride to and from any airport nationwide. We intend to continue to develop the footprint of our co-branded credit cards and pursue other loyalty partnerships in the future.
OPERATIONS AND COST STRUCTURE
Historically, our cost structure has allowed us to price fares lower than many of our competitors and is a principal reason for our profitable growth. Our current cost advantage relative to some of our competitors is due to, among other factors, high aircraft utilization, new and efficient aircraft, relatively low distribution costs, and a productive workforce. Because our network initiatives and growth plans require a low cost platform, we strive to stay focused on our competitive costs, operational excellence, efficiency improvements, and enhancing critical elements of the JetBlue Experience.
During 2016, we introduced an initiative to reduce our structural cost with the goal of saving $250 to $300 million by 2020. The program aims to cover all cost categories including our technical operations, corporate services, airports, and our distribution network. Through a combination of strategic sourcing, planning, automation, and a review of our distribution channel strategy, we anticipate delivering structural cost savings which will continue to allow us to deliver the JetBlue Experience to our Customers while maintaining a competitive cost structure. In the past two years, we made significant progress towards achieving this target and have secured approximately $199 million of the goal through renegotiated contracts, process optimization, and other structural cost initiatives. 
Route Structure
Our point-to-point system is the foundation of our operational structure, with the majority of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities. This structure allows us to optimize costs as well as accommodate Customers' preference for nonstop itineraries. A vast majority of our operations are centered in and around the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. This airspace is some of the world's most congested and drives certain operational constraints.
8

Our peak levels of traffic over the course of the year vary by route; the East Coast to Florida/Caribbean routes peak from October through April and the West Coast routes peak in the summer months. Many of our areas of operations in the Northeast experience poor winter weather conditions, resulting in increased costs associated with de-icing aircraft, canceled flights, and accommodating displaced Customers. Many of our Florida and Caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes. As we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses by other airlines.
•New York metropolitan area - We are New York's Hometown Airline®. Approximately one-half of our flights originate from or are destined to the New York metropolitan area, the nation's largest travel market. JFK is New York's largest airport, and we are the second largest airline at JFK as measured by domestic seats. Our 2018 operations accounted for 37% of seats offered on domestic routes from JFK. As JFK is a slot controlled airport, we have been able to continue to grow our operations by adding more seats per departure with the delivery of the Airbus A321 aircraft, restyling of the Airbus A320 aircraft, as well as continuing to optimize routes based upon load factor and costs. We operate from Terminal 5, or T5, which includes an international arrivals facility within our current T5 footprint. We believe T5 enables us to increase operational efficiencies, provide savings, streamline our operations and improve the overall travel experience for our Customers arriving from international destinations. We also serve New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, or Newark, New York City's LaGuardia Airport, or LaGuardia, New York's Stewart International Airport, or Newburgh, and New York's Westchester County Airport, or White Plains. We are the leading carrier in the average number of flights flown per day between the New York metropolitan area and Florida. In December 2017, we moved our operation at LaGuardia from the Central Terminal to the historic Marine Air Terminal, also known as Terminal A, bringing our Customers greater convenience and an improved ground experience while the Central Terminal undergoes reconstruction. We also added year-round Mint® service this year from New York to Seattle, as well as seasonal service to Liberia, our first Mint® city in Latin America.
•Boston - We are the largest carrier in terms of flights and capacity at Boston's Logan International Airport. At the end of 2018 we flew to 67 nonstop destinations from Boston and our operations accounted for more than 27% of all seats offered in Boston. We continue to capitalize on opportunities in the changing competitive landscape by adding routes, frequencies and increasing our relevance to local travelers. Our plan is to grow Boston with a general target of 200 flights per day. In September 2018, we announced nonstop service to Palm Springs beginning in February 2019. In October 2018, we announced nonstop service to Rochester, NY, beginning in January 2019. In November 2018, we launched nonstop service from Boston to Havana, becoming the only airline to fly nonstop between these two cities. To support our growing footprint in Boston, we have also executed an agreement with Massport that will bring our total number of gates to 30 gates by 2021, up from 27 gates at the end of 2018. 
•Caribbean and Latin America - At the end of 2018, we had 38 BlueCities in the Caribbean and Latin America and we expect our presence to continue to grow. San Juan, Puerto Rico is our only focus city outside of the Continental U.S. We are the largest airline in Puerto Rico serving more nonstop destinations than any other carrier. We are also the largest airline in the Dominican Republic, serving five airports. While the Caribbean and Latin American region is a growing part of our network, operating in this region can present challenges, including working with less developed airport infrastructure, political instability, and vulnerability to corruption. The second half of 2017 brought extraordinary weather conditions due to several strong hurricanes. In the days after Hurricane Maria, we introduced the 100x35JetBlue initiative, with 35 ways and 100 days, and beyond, of caring for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. The initiatives provided immediate first needs for the community, while also focusing on long-term productive partnerships to encourage the return of tourism, contribute to the local economy, and invest in the island's future. In June 2018, we marked the return of our full flight schedule on the island after the hurricanes in 2017.
•Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood - We are the largest carrier at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, or Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, with approximately 24% of all seats offered in 2018. We expect Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood to continue to be our fastest growing focus city. Flying out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood instead of nearby Miami International Airport helps preserve our competitive cost advantage through lower enplanement costs. In 2012, Broward County authorities commenced a multi-year refurbishment effort at the airport and surrounding facilities including the construction of a new south runway. We operate primarily out of Terminal 3 which is now connected to the upgraded and expanded international terminal. Terminal 3 allows for easy access to the expanded and enhanced airfield and the connection of these terminals has streamlined operations for both Crewmembers and Customers. Due to these factors, we believe Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood is an ideal location between the U.S. and Latin America as well as South Florida's high-value geography. During 2018, we launched nonstop services from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta, Santiago, Dominican Republic, and Grand Cayman. These new routes allow us to continually grow our presence in Fort Lauderdale.  We expect to add new service to Guayaquil, Ecuador beginning in February of 2019.

•Orlando - We are the third largest carrier in terms of capacity at Orlando International Airport, or Orlando, with 13% of all seats offered in 2018. Orlando is JetBlue's fourth largest focus city with 31 nonstop destinations and a growing mix of traffic including leisure, VFR, and business travelers. Our centralized training center, known as JetBlue University, is based in Orlando. In 2015, we opened the Lodge at OSC which is adjacent to our training center and is used for lodging our Crewmembers when they attend training. In May 2018, the Board of the Greater Orlando Airport Authority (GOAA) approved a non-binding memorandum of understand (MOU) for us to be the leading airline to operate out of the new South Terminal that is set to open in 2021. With the move to the South Terminal in 2021, we will have priority use of 14 gates that are capable of both domestic and international operations, compared to 10 domestic gates today. Under the terms of the MOU, we would also have priority rights to access more gates as we grow in the years to come. 
•Los Angeles area - We are the sixth largest carrier in the Los Angeles area measured by seats, operating from Long Beach Airport, or Long Beach, Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, Burbank's Bob Hope Airport, or Burbank, and Ontario International Airport, or Ontario. We are the largest carrier in Long Beach, with 72% of all seats offered in 2018 operated by JetBlue.
In June 2014, we started operating our premium service, Mint®, from LAX. We currently offer up to eleven daily round trips between JFK and LAX, up to four daily round trips between Boston and LAX, and up to three daily round trips between Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood and LAX. 
As part of our West Coast strategy, we made a series of network enhancements in 2018 that are designed to better meet the needs of coast-to-coast travelers. We launched new nonstop services in Ontario, California, Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and Bozeman, Montana, further growing our presence in the western U.S. We refined our schedule in Long Beach to better meet the needs of the market by reducing intra-west flying. We also increased frequencies on several popular transcontinental routes with the addition of a second daily nonstop service between Burbank and JFK. Similarly, we also added a second daily flight between Boston and Long Beach. 
Fleet Structure
We currently operate Airbus A321, Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 aircraft types. In 2018, our fleet had an average age of 9.8 years and operated an average of 11.8 hours per day. By scheduling and operating our aircraft more efficiently we are able to spread related fixed costs over a greater number of ASMs. 
The reliability of our fleet is essential to ensuring our operations run efficiently and we are continually working with our aircraft and engine manufacturers to enhance our performance.
We are working with the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, in efforts towards implementing the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen, by 2020. NextGen technology is expected to improve operational efficiency in the congested airspaces in which we operate. In 2012, we equipped 35 of our Airbus A320 aircraft to test ADS-B Out, a satellite based technology aimed to facilitate the communication between pilots and air traffic controllers. In accordance with FAA mandate, all of our aircraft are expected to be equipped with ADS-B Out by the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2012, we also became the first FAA certified Airbus A320 carrier in the U.S. to use satellite-based Special Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required, or RNP AR, approaches at two of JFK's prime and most used runways, 13L and 13R. As part of NextGen, our aircraft will also be outfitted with the following: 
•Satellite-based Communications: We are putting satellite-based voice and data communications (SATCOM) on our Airbus fleet. Every aircraft will be assigned a unique phone number, similar to a cell network. This will give us positive contact with our aircraft anywhere in the world.
•Data Comm: Data Comm makes departures more efficient by dramatically speeding up the process of aircraft pilots obtaining clearance from air traffic controllers. With Data Comm, controllers can simply push clearance details to the aircraft and dispatcher, which the pilot can confirm and automatically input into the flight computer with the push of a button. We recently received approval to equip our entire Airbus fleet with Data Comm. Data Comm is currently installed on 52 of our Airbus A321 aircraft and will be equipped on all of our Airbus A320 aircraft and future deliveries. 
In addition, we have also upgraded our entire fleet to the latest version of the Traffic Collision & Avoidance System (TCAS), a critical safety system that reduces the chance of a mid-air collision.
Fleet Maintenance
Consistent with our core value of safety, our FAA-approved maintenance programs are administered by our technical operations department. We use qualified maintenance personnel and ensure they have comprehensive training. We maintain our aircraft and associated maintenance records in accordance with, if not exceeding, FAA regulations. Fleet maintenance work is divided into three categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component maintenance.
10

The bulk of our line maintenance is handled by JetBlue technicians and inspectors. It consists of daily checks, overnight and weekly checks, or "A" checks, diagnostics, and routine repairs. 
Heavy maintenance checks, or "C" checks, consist of a series of more complex tasks taking from one to four weeks to complete and are typically performed once every 15 months. All of our aircraft heavy maintenance work is performed by third party FAA-approved facilities such as AAR, HAECO, Aeromantenimiento S.A., and Lufthansa Technik AG, and are subject to direct oversight by JetBlue personnel. We outsource heavy maintenance as the costs are lower than if we performed the tasks internally. 
Component maintenance on equipment such as engines, auxiliary power units, landing gears, pumps, and avionic computers are all performed by a number of different FAA-approved third party repair stations. We have time and materials agreements with Lufthansa Technik AG and IAE for the repair, overhaul, modification, and logistics of our Airbus aircraft engines. We also have a maintenance agreement with GE Engine Services, LLC for our Embraer aircraft engines. Many of our maintenance service agreements are based on a fixed cost per flight hour. These fixed costs vary based upon the age of the aircraft and other operating factors impacting the related component. Required maintenance not otherwise covered by these agreements is performed on a time and materials basis. All other maintenance activities are sub-contracted to qualified maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities. 
Aircraft Fuel
Aircraft fuel continues to be one of our largest expenses. Its price and availability has been extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We use a third party to assist with fuel management service and to procure most of our fuel. Our historical fuel consumption and costs for the years ended December 31 were:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Gallons consumed (millions) | 849 | | | 792 | | | 760 | 
Total cost (millions)(1) | $ | 1,899 | | | $ | 1,363 | | | $ | 1,074
Average price per gallon(1) | $ | 2.24 | | | $ | 1.72 | | | $ | 1.41 
Percent of operating expenses | 25.8 | % | | 22.6 | % | | 20.2 | %

(1) Total cost and average price per gallon each include related fuel taxes as well as effective fuel hedging gains and losses.
We attempt to protect ourselves against the volatility of fuel prices by entering into a variety of derivative instruments. These include swaps, caps, collars, and basis swaps with underlyings of jet fuel, crude and heating oil. 
Financial Health
We strive to maintain financial strength and a cost structure that enables us to grow profitably and sustainably. In the first years of our history, we relied on financing activities to fund much of our growth. Starting in 2007, our growth has largely been funded through internally generated cash from operations. Since 2014, while we have invested approximately $5.2 billion in capital assets, we have also generated approximately $6.8 billion in cash from operations, resulting in approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow. Our improved financial results have resulted in better credit ratings, which in turn allows for more attractive financing terms. Since 2014, we have also reduced our total debt balance by $0.9 billion.

JetBlue Travel Products
In 2018, we launched JBTP, LLC, or JetBlue Travel Products, which includes our JetBlue Vacations® brand and other non-air travel products including travel insurance, cruises, and car rental. With its Inspiration Center headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, we believe JetBlue Travel Products will play an important role in delivering our vision of becoming the most caring travel provider in the world, extending our reach further across the travel ribbon to offer Customers an even more seamless travel experience. 
TWA Flight Center Hotel Development
In 2015, the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, or the PANYNJ approved a construction plan to redevelop the TWA Flight Center at JFK on its nearly six-acre site into a hotel with over 500 rooms, meeting spaces, restaurants, a spa and an observation deck. The complex is planned to feature two six-story hotel towers. As part of the plan, a 75-year lease agreement involves Flight Center Hotel LLC, a partnership of MCR Development, LLC and JetBlue. We estimate our ultimate ownership in the hotel to be approximately 5% to 10% of the final total investment. During December 2016, the TWA Flight Center Hotel officially broke ground. The hotel is scheduled to open in 2019. It will be the first hotel on airport property at JFK since 2009. The only other hotels near the airport are budget accommodations a short drive away by shuttle bus or taxi. 
CULTURE
Our People
Our success depends on our Crewmembers delivering a terrific Customer experience in the sky and on the ground. One of our competitive strengths is a service oriented culture grounded in our five key values: safety, caring, integrity, passion and fun. We believe a highly productive and engaged workforce enhances customer loyalty. Our goal is to hire, train, and retain a diverse workforce of caring, passionate, fun and friendly people who share our mission to inspire humanity.
Our culture is first introduced to new Crewmembers during the screening process and then at an extensive new hire orientation program at JetBlue University, our training center in Orlando. Orientation focuses on the JetBlue strategy and emphasizes the importance of customer service, productivity, and cost control. We provide continuous training for our Crewmembers including technical training, a specialized captain leadership training program unique in the industry, a leadership program for current company managers, an emerging managers program, regular training focused on the safety value and front line training for our customer service teams. 
Our growth plans necessitate and facilitate opportunities for talent development. In 2008, we launched the University Gateway Program, one of our many pilot recruitment initiatives, which made us the first airline to provide a training program for undergraduate students interested in becoming JetBlue First Officers. In 2016, we launched Gateway Select, a program for prospective pilots to join us for a rigorous, approximately four-year training program that incorporates classroom learning, extensive real-world flying experience and instruction in full flight simulators.
We believe a direct relationship between Crewmembers and our leadership is in the best interests of our Crewmembers, our Customers, and our Shareholders. Except for our pilots and inflight Crewmembers, our Crewmembers do not have third-party representation. In April 2014, the Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA, was certified by the National Mediation Board, or NMB, as the representative body for JetBlue pilots after winning a representation election. We reached a final agreement for our first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by the pilots in July 2018. The agreement is a four-year renewable contract effective August 1, 2018 which included changes to compensation, benefits, work rules, and other policies. In April 2018, JetBlue inflight Crewmembers elected to be solely represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU. The NMB certified the TWU as the representative body for JetBlue inflight Crewmembers and we are working with the TWU to reach a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 44 percent of our full-time equivalent Crewmembers were represented by unions. The following table sets forth our Crewmember groups and the status of their respective collective bargaining agreements. 

Crewmember Group | Representative | Crewmembers(1) | Amendable Date(2)
Pilots | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 3,409 | August 1, 2022 
Inflight | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 4,480 | In negotiations 

(1) Approximate number of active full-time equivalent Crewmembers as of December 31, 2018.
12

(2) Our relations with our labor organizations are governed by Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, pursuant to which the collective bargaining agreements between us and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a certain date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
We have individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA licensed Crewmembers which consist of dispatchers, technicians, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and renews for an additional five-year term, unless the Crewmember is terminated for cause or the Crewmember elects not to renew. Pursuant to these employment agreements, Crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business, resulting in a reduction of flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these Crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. We believe that through these agreements we provide what we believe to be industry-leading job protection. We believe these agreements provide JetBlue and Crewmembers flexibility and allow us to react to Crewmember needs more efficiently than collective bargaining agreements.
A key feature of the direct relationship with our Crewmembers is our Values Committees which are made up of peer-elected frontline Crewmembers from each of our major work groups, other than pilots and inflight Crewmembers. They represent the interests of our workgroups and help us run our business in a productive and efficient manner. We believe this direct relationship with Crewmembers drives higher levels of engagement and alignment with JetBlue’s strategy, culture, and overall goals.
We believe the efficiency and engagement of our Crewmembers is a result of our flexible and productive work rules. We are cognizant of the competition for productive labor in key industry positions and new government rules requiring higher qualifications as well as more restricted hours that may result in potential labor shortages in the upcoming years. 
Our leadership team communicates on a regular basis with all Crewmembers in order to maintain a direct relationship and to keep them informed about news, strategy updates, and challenges affecting the airline and the industry. Effective and frequent communication throughout the organization is fostered through various means including email messages from our CEO and other senior leaders at least weekly, weekday news updates to all Crewmembers, Crewmember engagement surveys, a quarterly Crewmember magazine, and active leadership participation in new hire orientations. Leadership is also heavily involved in periodic open forum meetings across our network, called “pocket sessions” which are often videotaped and posted on our intranet. By soliciting feedback for ways to improve our service, teamwork and work environment, our leadership team works to keep Crewmembers engaged and makes our business decisions transparent. Additionally, we believe cost and revenue improvements are best recognized by Crewmembers on the job.
Our average number of full-time equivalent Crewmembers for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of 3,372 pilots, 4,452 inflight (whom other airlines may refer to as flight attendants), 4,651 airport operations personnel, 650 technicians (whom other airlines may refer to as mechanics), 1,319 reservation agents, and 3,322 management and other personnel. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we employed an average of 15,643 full-time and 5,249 part-time Crewmembers.
Crewmember Programs
We are committed to supporting our Crewmembers through a number of programs including: 
•Crewmember Resource Groups (CRGs) - These are groups formed by and consisting of Crewmembers to act as a resource for both the group members as well as JetBlue. The groups serve as an avenue to embrace and encourage different perspectives, thoughts and ideas. At the end of 2018, we had five CRGs in place: JetPride, Women in Flight, Vets in Blue, Blue Conexión, and the JetBlue African Diaspora Experience (JADE). All CRGs are committed to supporting the following pillars: professional development, JetBlue success, and recruitment and retention.
•JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund (JCCF) - This organization, originally formed in 2002, is a non-profit corporation independent from JetBlue and recognized by the IRS as of that date as a tax-exempt entity. JCCF was created to assist JetBlue Crewmembers and their immediate family members (IRS Dependents) in times of crisis. Funds for JCCF grants come directly from Crewmember donations via a tax-deductible payroll deduction. During 2017 we witnessed several unprecedented weather challenges including various hurricanes. JCCF helped provide over $2 million in relief to Crewmembers impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The assistance process is confidential with only the fund administrator and coordinator knowing the identity of the Crewmembers in need.
13

•JetBlue Scholars - Developed in 2015, this program offers a new and innovative model to our Crewmembers wishing to further their education. Crewmembers enrolled in the program can earn a bachelor's degree through self-directed online college courses facilitated by JetBlue. Since its inception, more than 1,000 Crewmembers have participated in the program with nearly 700 currently enrolled. Now in its third year, JetBlue Scholars keeps on growing. In the first year, Crewmembers earned 40 degrees and last year, 60 degrees. In November 2018 we celebrated the graduation of 60 of our Crewmembers who took the initiative and successfully completed their undergraduate college degrees. This reemphasizes our continuous effort to help provide assistance to our most valued asset, our people. In 2018, the JetBlue Scholars program was named a winner of the US. Department of Education's "2018 Reimagining the Higher Education Ecosystem Challenge," as well as a recipient of a "People's Choice" award after receiving the highest score during public voting. This challenge called upon educators, students, policymakers, industry leaders, technology developers, and the public to develop bold ideas to reimagine what the higher education ecosystem will look like in 2030. 
• Lift Recognition Program - Formed in 2012, this Crewmember recognition program encourages Crewmembers to celebrate their peers for living JetBlue's values by sending e-thanks through an on-line platform. Our senior leadership team periodically hosts an event for the Crewmembers who receive the highest number of Lift award recognitions in each quarter of the year. In 2018, we saw more than 200,000 Lift awards.
Community Programs
JetBlue is strongly committed to supporting the communities and BlueCities we serve through a variety of community programs including:
•100x35JetBlue - As the airline with more service than any other carrier in Puerto Rico and nearly 500 local Crewmembers, we take our commitment to the community very seriously. With 100x35JetBlue, an initiative JetBlue launched following Hurricane Maria making landfall in the Caribbean, we supported our Crewmembers, Customers, and communities to meet urgent needs and ongoing rebuilding efforts. JetBlue's support included helping replenish vegetation and the ecosystem, hosting free meal events, donating school supplies, partnering with community leaders and influencers to raise awareness and funds, and offering advertising space to promote Puerto Rican tourism.
•Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - The CSR team supports not-for-profit organizations focusing on youth and education, environment, and community in the BlueCities we serve. The team organizes and supports community service projects, charitable giving and non-profit partnerships such as KaBOOM!, which builds, opens and improves playgrounds to benefit millions of young children, and Soar with Reading, which works to get books into the hands of children who need them most including free book vending machines.
•JetBlue Foundation - Organized in 2013 as a non-profit corporation, the JetBlue Foundation is a JetBlue-sponsored organization to advance aviation-related education and to continue our efforts to promote aviation as a career choice for students. The foundation intends to do this by igniting interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The foundation is legally independent from JetBlue and has a Board of Directors as well as an Advisory Committee, both of which are made up of Crewmembers. The foundation is recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt entity.
•USO Center T5/JFK - Continuing our tradition of proudly supporting the men, women and families of the U.S. military, in September 2014 we opened a USO Center in T5 at JFK. The USO Center is open seven days a week, 365 days per year for military members and their families traveling on any airline at JFK, not just JetBlue. This USO Center is fully stocked with computers, televisions, gaming devices/stations, furniture, iPads, food, beverages and much more. In conjunction with leading airport design firm Gensler, Turner Construction Company, the PANYNJ and more than 28 contractors and individual donors, 100% of the space, services, labor and materials were donated to ensure the USO Center would be free of any financial burden. Crewmembers donate time throughout the year to help run the USO Center. 
•T5 Farm - Creating a healthier airport environment is a core pillar of JetBlue's sustainability philosophy. Through a partnership with TERRA brand and support from GrowNYC and the PANYNJ, we created the T5 Farm, a blue potato farm and produce garden on the roof of T5. The T5 Farm aims to serve as an agricultural and educational resource for the community, as well as a mechanism to absorb rainwater and runoff, reducing the possibility of flooding in the adjacent areas. Produce from the T5 Farm is donated to local food pantries.

REGULATION
Airlines are heavily regulated, with rules and regulations set by various federal, state and local agencies. We also operate under specific regulations due to our operations within the high density airspace of the northeast U.S. Most of our airline operations are regulated by U.S. governmental agencies including:
DOT - The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service including, but not limited to, certification and fitness, insurance, consumer protection and competitive practices. They set the requirement that carriers cannot permit domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours. The DOT also requires that the advertised price for an airfare or a tour package including airfare (such as a hotel/air vacation package) has to be the total price to be paid by the Customer, including all government taxes and fees. It has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions. 
FAA - The FAA primarily regulates flight operations, in particular, matters affecting air safety. This includes but is not limited to airworthiness requirements for aircraft, the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers, and the certification of flight attendants. It requires each airline to obtain an operating certificate authorizing the airline to operate at specific airports using specified equipment. Like all U.S. certified carriers, JetBlue cannot fly to new destinations without the prior authorization of the FAA. After providing notice and a hearing, the FAA has the authority to modify, suspend temporarily or revoke permanently our authority to provide air transportation or that of our licensed personnel for failure to comply with FAA regulations. It can additionally assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations. When significant safety issues are involved, it can revoke a U.S. carrier's authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing. It monitors our compliance with maintenance as well as flight operations and safety regulations. It maintains on-site representatives and performs frequent spot inspections of our aircraft, Crewmembers and records. The FAA also has the authority to issue airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders. This includes the inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, collision and windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement, and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. We have and maintain FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft and have the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the destinations we currently serve. 
Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection - The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, and the U.S. Customs and Boarder Protection, or CBP, operate under the Department of Homeland Security and are responsible for all civil aviation security. This includes passenger and baggage screening; cargo security measures; airport security; assessment and distribution of intelligence; security research and development; international passenger screening; customs; and agriculture. It also has law enforcement powers and the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of national emergency, without a notice or comment period. It can also assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain regulations. 
Taxes & Fees - The airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the U.S., with taxes and fees accounting for approximately 17% of the total fare charged to a Customer. Airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the Customer. The September 11 Security Fee which is set by the TSA and is passed through to the Customer, is currently $5.60 per enplanement, regardless of the number of connecting flights and a round trip fee is limited to a maximum of $11.20. Effective December 28, 2015, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Aircraft Inspection fee increased from $70.75 to $225 per international aircraft arriving in the U.S.
State and Local - We are subject to state and local laws and regulations in a number of states in which we operate and the regulations of various local authorities operating the airports we serve.
Airport Access - JFK, LaGuardia, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, or Reagan National, are slot-controlled airports subject to the "High Density Rule" and successor rules issued by the FAA, or Slots. These rules were implemented due to the high volume of traffic at these popular airports located in the northeast corridor airspace. The rules limit the air traffic in and out of these airports during specific times; however, even with the rules in place, delays remain among the highest in the nation due to continuing airspace congestion. Additionally, we have Slots at other Slot-controlled airports governed by unique local ordinances not subject to the High Density Rule, including Westchester County Airport in White Plains, NY and Long Beach (California) Municipal Airport. Gate access is another common issue at certain airports. As an example, we started flying to Atlanta in the first half of 2017 and were not granted the agreed upon number of gates.
15

Airport Infrastructure - The northeast corridor of the U.S. contains some of the most congested airspaces in the world. The airports in this region are some of the busiest in the country, the majority of which are more than 60 years old. Due to high usage and aging infrastructure, issues arise at these airports that are not necessarily seen in other parts of the country. At LaGuardia, in late 2017 we moved from Central Terminal B to the historic Marine Air Terminal A. The Marine Air Terminal has a beautiful historic design which we plan to honor while adding our own modern touches to create an airport experience in line with the award-winning service our Customers receive onboard. Our makeover of the Terminal included updated and additional concessions post-security, more seating, and technology upgrades. The Terminal features an expanded check-in area with self-bag-tagging kiosks and a dedicated TSA Pre-Check lane with JetBlue as the sole tenant, occupying four gates.
Foreign Operations - International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The availability of international routes to U.S. airlines is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments. We currently operate international service to Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Saint Lucia, St. Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. To the extent we seek to provide air transportation to additional international markets in the future, we would be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government. 
We believe we are operating in material compliance with DOT, FAA, TSA, CBP and applicable international regulations as well as hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations and certificates. Should any of these authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended or revoked, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Other
Environmental - We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. This includes the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals as well as the regulation of aircraft noise administered by numerous state and federal agencies.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures as long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with the interstate and foreign commerce of the national air transportation system. Certain airports, including San Diego and Long Beach airports in California, have established restrictions to limit noise which can include limits on the number of hourly or daily operations and the time of such operations. These limitations are intended to protect the local noise-sensitive communities surrounding the airport. Our scheduled flights at Long Beach and San Diego are in compliance with the noise curfew limits, but on occasion when we experience irregular operations, we may violate these curfews. In 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Long Beach City Prosecutor which requires us to pay a $6,000 fine per violation. The payments resulting from curfew violations go to support the Long Beach Public Library Foundation. This local ordinance has not had, and we believe it will not have, a negative effect on our operations.
We report annually on environmental, social, governance (ESG) issues and our response to them uses the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework. The report can be found on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.jetblue.com.
As part of our sustainability and environmental strategy, we are embracing new technologies and making changes that will ultimately benefit our Crewmembers, Customers and the environment. In 2018, we began replacing our gas-powered Ground Service Equipment (GSE) at JFK with electric-powered versions, known as eGSE, which will help the environment by reducing fuel consumption and noise. We also partnered with Airbus to use a renewable jet fuel blend on selected A321 aircraft acceptance and delivery flights in 2018. 
In 2017, JetBlue focused our sustainability efforts on three areas: Climate Leadership, Sustainable Operations, and Sustainable Tourism. Climate Leadership encompasses climate change related risk and greenhouse gases associated with the burning of jet fuel, our biggest environmental impact and regulatory exposure. Sustainable Operations encompasses implementation of operational change and new technologies to reduce our cost of natural resources associated with the operations. Sustainable Tourism encompasses commercial and environmental research to forecast future demand for tourism. Additional information can be found on www.jetblue.com/green/.
During 2016, we entered into a partnership to buy renewable jet fuel produced from plant derived oils. This marked the largest, long-term, commitment globally by any airline for a jet fuel based on fatty acids. Early engagement with a renewable jet fuel supply positions JetBlue to reduce costs associated with CO2 emissions. 
Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and diesel engine emissions. In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage 
16

carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. CORSIA is scheduled to take effect by 2021. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but we believe compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
Foreign Ownership - Under federal law and DOT regulations, JetBlue must be controlled by U.S. citizens. In this regard, our president and at least two-thirds of our board of directors must be U.S. citizens. Further, no more than 24.99% of our outstanding common stock may be voted by non-U.S. citizens. We believe we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions.
Other Regulations - All airlines are subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 due to their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. They are also required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we take all necessary steps to comply with those requirements.
