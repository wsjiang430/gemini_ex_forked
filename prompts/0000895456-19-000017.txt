 ﻿
 We are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear and apparel marketed under a portfolio of well recognized brand names including Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh, and the licensed brand Michelin.  Our brands have a long history of representing high quality, comfortable, functional and durable footwear and our products are organized around seven target markets: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, military, western, and lifestyle.  Our footwear products incorporate varying features and are positioned across a range of suggested retail price points from $34.99 for our value priced products to $309.99 for our premium products.  In addition, as part of our strategy of outfitting consumers from head-to-toe, we market complementary branded apparel and accessories that we believe leverage the strength and positioning of each of our brands.
 ﻿
 Our products are distributed through three distinct business segments: wholesale, retail and military.  In our wholesale business, we distribute our products through a wide range of distribution channels representing over 10,000 retail store locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as in several international markets.  Our wholesale channels vary by product line and include sporting goods stores, outdoor retailers, independent shoe retailers, hardware stores, catalogs, mass merchants, uniform stores, farm store chains, specialty safety stores, specialty retailers and online retailers.  Our retail business includes direct sales of our products to consumers through our business to business web platform, e-commerce websites, third party marketplaces and our Rocky outlet store. We also sell footwear under the Rocky label to the U.S. military.

 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 Our competitive strengths include: 
 ﻿

· | Strong portfolio of brands. We believe the Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, Lehigh, and Michelin brands are well recognized and established names that have a reputation for performance, quality and comfort in the markets they serve: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, western and lifestyle. We plan to continue strengthening these brands through product innovation in existing footwear markets, by extending certain of these brands into our other target markets and by introducing complementary apparel and accessories under our own brands. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Commitment to product innovation. We believe a critical component of our success in the marketplace has been a result of our continued commitment to product innovation. Our consumers demand high quality, durable products that incorporate the highest level of comfort and the most advanced technical features and designs. We have a dedicated group of product design and development professionals, including well recognized experts in the footwear and apparel industries, who continually interact with consumers to better understand their needs and are committed to ensuring our products reflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Long-term retailer relationships. We believe that our long history of designing, manufacturing and marketing premium quality, branded footwear has enabled us to develop strong relationships with our retailers in each of our distribution channels. We reinforce these relationships by continuing to offer innovative footwear products, by continuing to meet the individual needs of each of our retailers and by working with our retailers to improve the visual merchandising of our products in their stores. We believe that strengthening our relationships with retailers will allow us to increase our presence through additional store locations and expanded shelf space, improve our market position in a consolidating retail environment and enable us to better understand and meet the evolving needs of both our retailers and consumers.

· | Diverse product sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. We believe our strategy of utilizing both company operated and third-party facilities for the sourcing of our products, offers several advantages. Operating our own facilities significantly improves our knowledge of the entire production process, which allows us to more efficiently source product from third parties that is of the highest quality and at the lowest cost available. We intend to continue to source a higher proportion of our products from third-party manufacturers, which we believe will enable us to obtain high quality products at lower costs per unit. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Growth Strategy
 ﻿
 We intend to increase our sales through the following strategies: 
 ﻿

· | Expand into new target markets under existing brands. We believe there is significant opportunity to extend certain of our brands into our other target markets. We intend to continue to introduce products across varying feature sets and price points in order to meet the needs of our customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Cross-sell our brands to our retailers. We believe that many retailers of our existing and acquired brands target consumers with similar characteristics and, as a result, we believe there is significant opportunity to offer each of our retailers a broader assortment of footwear and apparel that target multiple markets and span a range of feature sets and price points.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Expand business internationally. We intend to extend certain of our brands into international markets. We believe this is a significant opportunity because of the long history and authentic heritage of these brands. We intend on growing our business internationally through a network of distributors. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Increases in our Lehigh business. We believe that our business to business CustomFit platform has ample opportunity to grow as we continue to pursue large manufacturers, distributors, and other companies who are reliant on safety footwear programs. We feel that diversifying our product lines and continuing to provide an easy, no hassle approach to purchasing, will allow us to expand within the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Acquire or develop new brands. We intend to continue to acquire or develop new brands that are complementary to our portfolio and could leverage our operational infrastructure and distribution network. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Product Lines    ﻿
 Our product lines consist of high-quality products that target the following markets:
 ﻿

· | Outdoor. Our outdoor product lines consist of footwear, apparel and accessory items marketed to outdoor enthusiasts who spend time actively engaged in activities such as hunting, fishing, camping and hiking. Our consumers demand high quality, durable products that incorporate the highest level of comfort and the most advanced technical features, and we are committed to ensuring our products reflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace. Our outdoor product lines consist of all-season sport/hunting footwear, apparel and accessories that are typically waterproof and insulated and are designed to keep outdoor enthusiasts comfortable on rugged terrain or in extreme weather conditions.

The U.S. military products are marketed under the Rocky Brand name. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our products are marketed under four well-recognized, proprietary brands, Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, and Lehigh, in addition to the licensed brand Michelin.
 ﻿
 Rocky
 ﻿
 Rocky, established in 1979, is our premium priced line of branded footwear, apparel and accessories.  We currently design Rocky products for each of our seven target markets and offer our products at a range of suggested retail price points: $49.99 to $309.99 for our footwear products, $19.99 to $239.99 for tops and bottoms in our apparel lines and $5.99 to $59.99 for our basic and technical outerwear.
 ﻿
 The Rocky brand originally targeted outdoor enthusiasts, particularly hunters, and has since become a market leader in the hunting boot category.  In 2002, we also extended into hunting apparel, including jackets, pants, gloves and caps. Our Rocky products for hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts are designed for specific weather conditions and the diverse terrains of North America.  These products incorporate a range of technical features and designs such as Gore-Tex waterproof breathable fabric, 3M Thinsulate insulation, nylon Cordura fabric and camouflaged uppers featuring either Mossy Oak or Realtree patterns.  We use rugged outsoles made by industry leaders like Vibram as well as our own proprietary design features like the “Rocky Ride Comfort System” to make the products durable and easy to wear.
 ﻿
 We also produce Rocky duty and commercial military footwear targeting law enforcement professionals, military, security workers and postal service employees, and we believe we have established a leading market share position in this category.  
 ﻿
 In 2002, we introduced Rocky work footwear designed for varying weather conditions or difficult terrain, particularly for people who make their living outdoors such as those in lumber, forestry, and oil & gas occupations.  These products typically include many of the proprietary features and technologies that we incorporate in our hunting and outdoor products.  
 ﻿
 We have also introduced western influenced work boots for farmers and ranchers.  Most of these products are waterproof, insulated and utilize our proprietary comfort systems.  We have also introduced men’s and women’s casual western footwear for consumers enamored with western influenced fashion.
 ﻿
 Georgia Boot
 ﻿
 Georgia Boot was launched in 1937 and is our moderately priced, high quality line of work footwear.  Georgia Boot footwear is sold at suggested retail price points ranging from $65.99 to $269.99.  This line of products primarily targets construction workers and those who work in industrial plants where special safety features are required for hazardous work environments.  Many of our boots incorporate steel toes or metatarsal guards to protect wearers’ feet from heavy objects and non-slip outsoles to prevent slip related injuries in the work place.  All of our boots are designed to help prevent injury and subsequent work loss and are designed according to standards determined by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration or other standards required by employers.
 ﻿
 In addition, we market a line of Georgia Boot footwear to brand loyal consumers for hunting and other outdoor activities.  These products are primarily all leather boots distributed in the western and southwestern states where hunters do not require camouflaged boots or other technical features incorporated in our Rocky footwear.
 ﻿

     Durango
 ﻿
 Durango is our moderately priced, high quality line of western footwear.  Launched in 1965, the brand has developed broad appeal and earned a reputation for authenticity and quality in the western footwear and apparel market.  Our current line of products is offered at suggested retail price points ranging from $54.99 to $219.99, and we market products designed for both work and casual wear.  Our Durango line of products primarily targets farm and ranch workers who live in the heartland where western influenced footwear and apparel is worn for work and casual wear and, to a lesser extent, this line appeals to urban consumers enamored with western influenced fashion.  Many of our western boots marketed to farm and ranch workers are designed to be durable, including special “barn yard acid resistant” leathers to maintain integrity of the uppers, and incorporate our proprietary “Comfort Core” system to increase ease of wear and reduce foot fatigue.  Other products in the Durango line that target casual and fashion-oriented consumers have colorful leather uppers and shafts with ornate stitch patterns and are offered for men, women and children.
 ﻿
 Lehigh
 ﻿
 The Lehigh brand was launched in 1922 and is our moderately priced, high quality line of safety shoes sold at suggested retail price points ranging from $78.99 to $243.99.  Our current line of products is designed to meet occupational safety footwear needs.  Most of this footwear incorporates steel toes to protect workers and often incorporates other safety features such as metatarsal guards or non-slip outsoles.  Additionally, certain models incorporate durability features to combat abrasive surfaces or caustic substances often found in some work places.
 ﻿
 With the shift in manufacturing jobs to service jobs in the U.S., Lehigh began marketing products for the hospitality industry.  These products have non-slip outsoles designed to reduce slips, trips and falls in hospitality environments where floors are often tiled and greasy.  Price points for this kind of footwear range from $39.99 to $105.99.
 ﻿
 Michelin
 ﻿
 Michelin is a premier price point line of work footwear targeting specific industrial professions, primarily indoor professions.  The license to design, develop and manufacture footwear under the Michelin name was secured in 2006.  Suggested retail prices for the Michelin brand are from $34.99 to $249.99.  The license agreement for the Michelin brand expires on December 31, 2020, with the option to renew. 
 ﻿
 Sales and Distribution
 ﻿
 Our products are distributed through three distinct business segments: wholesale, retail and military. See Note 16 of our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding our three business segments.
 ﻿
 Wholesale
 ﻿
 In the U.S., we distribute Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, and Michelin products through a wide range of wholesale distribution channels. As of December 31, 2018, our products were offered for sale at over 10,000 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada.
 ﻿
 We sell our products to wholesale accounts in the U.S. primarily through a dedicated in-house sales team who carry our branded products exclusively, as well as independent sales representatives who carry our branded products and other non-competing products.  Our sales force is organized around major accounts, including Bass Pro Shops, Cabela’s, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Tractor Supply Company, Amazon and Kohl’s, and around our target markets: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, lifestyle and western.  For our Rocky, Georgia Boot and Durango brands, our sales employees are organized around each brand and target a broad range of distribution channels.  All of our sales people actively call on their retail customer base to educate them on the quality, comfort, technical features and breadth of our product lines and to ensure that our products are displayed effectively at retail locations.
 ﻿
 Our wholesale distribution channels vary by market: 
 ﻿

· | Our outdoor products are sold primarily through sporting goods stores, outdoor specialty stores, online retailers, catalogs, and mass merchants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Our work-related products are sold primarily through retail uniform stores, catalogs, farm store chains, specialty safety stores, independent shoe stores, hardware stores and online retailers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Our duty products are sold primarily through uniform stores, catalog specialists and online retailers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Our commercial military products are sold primarily through base exchanges such as AAFES and consumer e-commerce websites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Our western products are sold through western stores, work specialty stores, specialty farm and ranch stores, online retailers and more recently, fashion-oriented footwear retailers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Retail
 ﻿
 We market products directly to consumers through three retail strategies under the Lehigh retail brand: Lehigh business-to-business including direct sales and through our Custom Fit websites, consumer e-commerce websites and third-party marketplaces,  and our stores, which include our outlet store and retail stores.
 ﻿
 Websites
 ﻿
 We sell our product lines on our websites at www.rockyboots.com, www.georgiaboot.com, www.durangoboot.com, www.lehighoutfitters.com, www.lehighsafetyshoes.com, www.slipgrips.com, and 4eursole.com.  We believe that our internet presence allows us to showcase the breadth and depth of our product lines in each of our target markets and enables us to educate our consumers about the unique technical features of our products.  We also sell to our business customers directly through our Custom Fit websites that are tailored to the specific needs of our customers.  Our customers’ employees order directly through their employers’ established Custom Fit website and the footwear is delivered directly to the consumer via a common freight carrier. Our customers include large, national companies such as Carnival Cruise Lines, Pepsi, Schneider, Whirlpool, Holland America Cruise Lines, and Waste Management.
 ﻿
 Outlet Store
 ﻿
 We operate the Rocky outlet store in Nelsonville, Ohio.  Our outlet store primarily sells first quality or discontinued products in addition to a limited amount of factory damaged goods.  Related products from other manufacturers are also sold in the store.  Our outlet store allows us to showcase the breadth of our product lines as well as to cost-effectively sell slow-moving inventory.  Our outlet store also provides an opportunity to interact with consumers to better understand their needs.
 ﻿
 Retail Stores
 ﻿
 Lehigh’s successful continued focus on converting our customers from delivery via our mobile and retail stores to purchasing via our Custom Fit sites and delivery direct has led to the continued reduction of the mobile and retail stores in the past several years. In 2018, we stopped serving the New York Transit Authority with mobile stores. As of December 31, 2018, our only remaining retail store is located at The Puget Sound Naval Base.
 ﻿
 Military
 ﻿
 While we are focused on continuing to build our wholesale and retail business, we also actively bid, from time to time, on footwear contracts with the U.S. military.  Our sales under such contracts are dependent on us winning the bids for these contracts.  
 ﻿
 We are currently fulfilling several multiyear contracts for the U.S. military. 
 ﻿
 Marketing and Advertising
 ﻿
 We believe that our brands have a reputation for high quality, comfort, functionality and durability built through their long history in the markets they serve.  To further increase the strength and awareness of our brands, we have developed comprehensive marketing and advertising programs to gain national exposure and expand brand awareness for each of our brands in their target markets.
 ﻿
 We have focused the majority of our advertising efforts on both digital advertising and consumer advertising in support of our retail partners. Digital advertising includes online brand level marketing, search engine pay-per-click, retargeting and social media targeting. A key component to supporting our retail partners includes in-store point of purchase materials that add a dramatic focus to our brands and the products our retail partners carry.  We also advertise through targeted national and local cable programs and print publications aimed at audiences that share the demographic profile of our typical customers.  In addition, we promote through event sponsorships which provide significant national exposure for all of our brands as well as a direct connection to our target consumer.  Our print advertisements and television commercials emphasize the technical features of our products as well as their high quality, comfort, functionality and durability. 
 ﻿

     We also support independent dealers by listing their locations in our national print advertisements.  In addition to our national advertising campaigns, we have developed attractive merchandising displays and store-in-store concept fixturing that are available to our retailers who purchase the breadth of our product lines.  We also attend numerous tradeshows which allow us to showcase our entire product line to retail buyers and have historically been an important source of new accounts. 
 ﻿
 Product Design and Development
 ﻿
 We believe that product innovation is a key competitive advantage for us in each of our markets.  Our goal in product design and development is to continue to create and introduce new and innovative footwear and apparel products that combine our standards of quality, functionality and comfort and that meet the changing needs of our retailers and consumers.  Our product design and development process is highly collaborative and is typically initiated both internally by our development staff and externally by our retailers and suppliers, whose employees are generally active users of our products and understand the needs of our consumers.  Our product design and development personnel, marketing personnel and sales representatives work closely together to identify opportunities for new styles, camouflage patterns, design improvements and newer, more advanced materials.  We have a dedicated group of product design and development professionals, some of whom are well recognized experts in the footwear and apparel industries, who continually interact with consumers to better understand their needs and are committed to ensuring our products reflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing and Sourcing
 ﻿
 We manufacture footwear in facilities that we operate in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and source footwear, apparel and accessories from third-party facilities, primarily in China.  We do not have long-term contracts with any of our third-party manufacturers. We believe that operating our own facilities significantly improves our knowledge of the entire raw material sourcing and manufacturing process enabling us to more efficiently source finished goods from third parties that are of the highest quality and at the lowest cost available as well as reduce our lead times.  In addition, our Puerto Rican facilities allow us to produce footwear for the U.S. military and other commercial businesses that require production by a U.S. manufacturer.  Sourcing products from offshore third-party facilities generally enables us to lower our costs per unit while maintaining high product quality and it limits the capital investment required to establish and maintain company operated manufacturing facilities.  Because quality is an important part of our value proposition to our retailers and consumers, we source products from manufacturers who have demonstrated the intent and ability to maintain the high quality that has become associated with our brands.
 ﻿
 Quality control is stressed at every stage of the manufacturing process and is monitored by trained quality assurance personnel at each of our manufacturing facilities, including our third-party factories.  In addition, we utilize a team of procurement, quality control and logistics employees in our China office to visit factories to conduct quality control reviews of raw materials, work in process inventory and finished goods.  We also utilize quality control personnel at our finished goods distribution facilities to conduct quality control testing on incoming sourced finished goods and raw materials and inspect random samples from our finished goods inventory from each of our manufacturing facilities to ensure that all items meet our high-quality standards.
 ﻿
 Foreign Operations and Sales Outside of the United States
 ﻿

Our products are primarily distributed in the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  We ship our products from our finished goods distribution facility located in Logan, Ohio and third-party logistics operations in Sumner, Washington and Ontario, Canada.  In early 2018, the Washington and Canada logistics operations were wound down and closed. Certain of our retailers receive shipments directly from our manufacturing sources, including all of our U.S. military sales, which are shipped directly from our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico.  Net sales to foreign countries represented approximately 1.9% of net sales in 2018 and 3.0% of net sales in 2017.
 ﻿
 As previously mentioned, we maintain manufacturing facilities that we operate in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.  In addition, we utilize an office in China to support our contract manufacturers. 
 ﻿
 The net book value of fixed assets located outside of the U.S. totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2018 and $3.2 million at December 31, 2017.
 ﻿
 Suppliers
 ﻿
 We purchase raw materials from sources worldwide.  We do not have any long-term supply contracts for the purchase of our raw materials, except for limited blanket purchase orders on leather to protect wholesale selling prices for an extended period of time.  The principal raw materials used in the production of our products, in terms of dollar value, are leather, Gore-Tex waterproof breathable fabric, Cordura nylon fabric and soling materials.  We believe these materials will continue to be available from our current suppliers.  However, in the event these materials are not available from our current suppliers, we believe these products, or similar products, would be available from alternative sources.

     Seasonality and Weather
 ﻿
 Historically, we have experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our business as many of our footwear products are used by consumers in adverse weather conditions. In order to meet these demands, we must manufacture and source footwear year-round to be in a position to ship advance and at once orders for these products during the last two quarters of each year.  Accordingly, average inventory levels have been highest during the second and third quarters of each year and sales have been highest in the last two quarters of the year.  In addition, mild or dry weather conditions historically have had a material adverse effect on sales of our outdoor products, particularly if they occurred in broad geographical areas during late fall or early winter. 
 ﻿
 Backlog

﻿ | | | | 
------------------+---+--------------------------+---+-----
﻿ | | Years Ended December 31,
($ in millions) | | 2018 | | 2017
Wholesale Backlog | $ | 15.5 | $ | 16.3
Military Backlog | | 13.0 | | 26.2
Total Backlog | $ | 28.5 | $ | 42.5

  ﻿
 Our backlog consists of all open orders as of December 31st of the corresponding year to be shipped at any point in the future. Additionally, factors other than seasonality could have a significant impact on our backlog and, therefore, our backlog at any one point in time may not be indicative of future results.  
 ﻿
 Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names 
 ﻿
 We own numerous design and utility patents for footwear, footwear components (such as insoles and outsoles) and outdoor apparel in the U.S. and in foreign countries including Canada, Mexico, China and Taiwan.  We own U.S. and certain foreign registrations for the trademarks used in our business, including our trademarks Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango, and Lehigh.  In addition, we license trademarks, including Gore-Tex and Michelin, in order to market our products.
 ﻿
 Our license with W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. permits us to use the Gore-Tex and related marks on products and styles that have been approved in advance by Gore.  The license agreement has a one-year term that automatically renews each year, unless either party elects to terminate by giving advance written notice to the other party by October 1 for termination effective December 31 of that same year.
 ﻿
 Our license with Michelin Lifestyle Limited permits us to use the Michelin brand and related marks on our products.  Our license agreement with Michelin Lifestyle Limited to use the Michelin name expires on December 31, 2020, with the option to renew.
 ﻿
 In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 15 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. Our trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to become generic. Trademarks registered outside of the U.S. generally have a duration of 10 years depending on the jurisdiction and are also generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon appropriate application. 
 ﻿
 While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents and trademarks, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.  We are not aware of any material infringement of our intellectual property rights or that we are infringing any intellectual property rights owned by third parties.  Moreover, we are not aware of any material conflicts concerning our trademarks or our use of trademarks owned by others.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 We operate in a very competitive environment.  Product function, design, comfort, quality, technological and material improvements, brand awareness, timeliness of product delivery and pricing are all important elements of competition in the markets for our products.  We believe that the strength of our brands, the quality of our products and our long-term relationships with a broad range of retailers allows us to compete effectively in the footwear and apparel markets that we serve.  However, we compete with footwear and apparel companies that have greater financial, marketing, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do.  In addition, many of these competitors have strong brand name recognition in the markets they serve.
 ﻿
 The footwear and apparel industry is also subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences.  Some of our product lines are susceptible to changes in both technical innovation and fashion trends.  Therefore, the success of these products and styles are more dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing product, material and design innovations as well as fashion trends and consumer demands in a timely manner.  Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect consumer acceptance of these product lines and styles and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     Employees 
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,087 employees of which approximately 2,070 are full time employees.  Approximately 1,728 of our employees work in our manufacturing facilities in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.  None of our employees are represented by a union.  We believe our relations with our employees are in good standing.
