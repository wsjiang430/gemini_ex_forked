ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Historical Company Information
 We were initially incorporated in 1968 as GolfRounds, Inc., a Florida corporation.  During July 1999, GolfRounds, Inc. was re-domesticated to Delaware through a merger into its wholly-owned subsidiary GolfRounds.com, Inc. Effective May 28, 2014, GolfRounds.com, Inc. amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to Fuse Medical, Inc. (“Fuse” or our “Company”) and merged with and into Fuse Medical, LLC, with Fuse Medical, LLC surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fuse.  The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger. Fuse was the legal acquirer, and Fuse Medical, LLC was deemed the accounting acquirer.  During 2015, certificates of termination were filed for Fuse Medical, LLC and its two subsidiaries.
 On December 19, 2016 (the “Change-in-Control Date”), we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between NC 143 Family Holdings, LP, a Texas limited partnership (“NC 143”) which is controlled by Mark W. Brooks (“Mr. Brooks”), our Chairman of our Board of Directors (“Board”) and President; and Reeg Medical Industries, Inc., a Texas corporation, (“RMI”, and together with NC 143, the “Investors”), which is owned and controlled by Christopher C. Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary (“Mr. Reeg”). The closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement resulted in a change-in-control of our Company whereby the Investors beneficially acquired approximately 61.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), immediately after the Change-in-Control Date. 
 On December 31, 2017 we completed the acquisition of CPM Medical Consultants, LLC (“CPM”) in which we purchased all outstanding membership units of CPM pursuant to the securities purchase agreement (“CPM Acquisition Agreement” and such transaction the “CPM Acquisition”). In the CPM Acquisition, Fuse was the legal acquirer, and for accounting purposes, CPM was deemed to have acquired Fuse. As a result, this 2018 Annual Report reflects CPM as the reporting entity for 2017 and 2016 and is consolidated with Fuse effective on the Change-in-Control Date.
 Maxim Acquisition
 On July 30, 2018, we, entered into that certain securities purchase agreement (the “Maxim Purchase Agreement”), by and between , Palm Springs Partners, LLC d/b/a Maxim Surgical, a Texas limited liability company (“Maxim”), RMI, Mr. Amir David Tahernia, an individual (“Tahernia”, together with RMI, the “Sellers”), and Tahernia in his capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the “Sellers’ Representative”) dated July 30, 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity securities of Maxim (“Maxim Interests”) from the Sellers (such transaction, the “Maxim Acquisition”) for aggregate consideration of approximately $3,400,000, as reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 3, 2018, and amended by Current Report on Form 8-K/A, filed with the SEC on October 15, 2018, and herein incorporated by reference. Before the Maxim Acquisition, Mr. Reeg served as Maxim’s President and was a beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of our Common Stock as contained in this 2018 Annual Report.
 On August 1, 2018 (“Maxim Closing Date”), we completed the Maxim Acquisition pursuant to the Maxim Purchase Agreement, as more fully described in “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence” contained in this 2018 Annual Report. 
Overview
 We are a national distributor of medical devices providing a broad portfolio of orthopedic implants including: (i) internal and external fixation products; (ii) upper and lower extremity plating and total joint reconstruction implants; (iii) soft tissue fixation and augmentation for sports medicine procedures; (iv) full spinal implants for trauma, degenerative disc disease, and deformity indications (collectively, “Orthopedic Implants”); and (v) a wide array of osteo-biologics, regenerative tissues and amniotic tissue, which include human allografts, substitute bone materials, and tendons and regenerative tissues and fluids (“Biologics”). All of our medical devices are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for sale in the United States, and all of our Biologics suppliers are licensed tissue banks accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks. Additionally, we are seeking to grow our manufacturing operations, both by internal product development and by acquiring existing FDA approved devices through various transactions. For example, we acquired the Maxim X-Treme Interbody Fusion System (“Maxim X-Treme System”) through the Maxim Acquisition, which represented a significant step toward expanding our Company from a medical device distributor into an integrated medical device distributor that also operates as the FDA’s manufacturer of record (the “Manufacturer”) and as an FDA-registered medical device specification developer and repackager/relabeler.

Distribution
 We believe our broad portfolio of Orthopedic Implants and Biologics provide high-quality products to assist surgeons with positive patient outcomes and cost-effective solutions for our customers, which include hospitals, medical facilities, and sub-distributors. We operate under exclusive and non-exclusive agreements with our vendors, contract manufacturers and supply partners in the geographic territories that we serve. 
 We pride ourselves on developing collaborative supplier relationships resulting in a strong and diverse supplier network. Currently we maintain distribution agreements with approximately 55 different suppliers, with our top five suppliers representing approximately 39% of our consolidated cost of revenue and our top ten suppliers representing more than 50% of our consolidated cost of revenues.
 One of our significant Bio
logics suppliers is Vivex Biomedical, Inc., a biomedical company, focused on cellular therapies that treat orthopedic, spine, wound, and soft tissue indications. OrthoSolutions Group Ltd., Inc. is one of our largest suppliers of Orthopedic Implants for low
er extremities as well as FH Orthopedics, Inc. for shoulder replacement systems. Another supplier we have is Spinal USA for medical devices used in spine surgeries. During 2016, we contracted with Tyber Medical, LLC, a manufacturer of Orthopedic Implants, to develop and expand our private label initiatives, including for foot, ankle, and spinal implant related products.
 During 2018, we successfully entered into new stocking distribution agreements with two (2) manufacturers for non-exclusive distribution rights in the United States for their total knee and total hip replacement systems, as our replacement suppliers for UOC USA, Inc., which terminated February 28, 2018. For more information on the termination of our contract with UOC USA, Inc., please see “Item 9B. 
Other Information
” on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. We are also evaluating the opportunity to license those manufacturers’ technology for our own branding opportunities and would allow us the right to expand the product portfolio offerings.
 To further our business objectives, we use our knowledge of the healthcare industry and leverage our relationships with key suppliers, manufacturers, facility materials management, and distribution channels. In 2018, we estab
lished Scientific Advisory Boards (“SABs”) to assist with our product development and design input. Members of our SABs include the heads of teaching hospitals and universities, clinical residency programs, and clinical fellowship programs at some of the most respected institutions in the nation. Our SABs have provided valuable insight for both our products coming to market as well as the design and development of new products in our pipeline. We continuously review our product lines, both internally and with our SABs, by proactively evaluating product trends to ensure we offer a comprehensive, high-quality, and cost-effective selection of Orthopedic Implants and Biologics. We believe these efforts enable us to become leaders in our industry and to expand our existing customer base.
 Manufacturing
 Due to the Maxim Acquisition, we are now an FDA-registered medical device specification developer and repackager/relabeler and the Manufacturer of the Maxim X-Treme System. The FDA has granted 510(k) clearance (“510(k) Approval”) to our Maxim X-Treme System, authorizing us to commercially distribute the Maxim X-Treme System. The 510(k) Approval process, also known as pre-market notification, requires demonstrating that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally U.S. marketed medical device. Once a device receives a 510(k) Approval, maintaining that status is based on compliance with annual requirements set by the FDA.
 To produce our Maxim X-Treme System, we purchase raw materials, primarily consisting of Solvay Zeniva® PEEK polymers, from our domestic supplier, Solvay, and contract directly with AR Fabricating, our contract manufacturer for the Maxim X-Treme System. We do not believe there are material risks associated with contracting with only one (1) supplier for our raw materials, as we typically obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products, and believe it is unlikely there would be a shortage of these raw materials in the future. As of the date of this 2018 Annual Report, we have not experienced any adverse sourcing, delays, or issues regarding our raw materials. 
 During 2018, we also began building on our private label products through key relationships and suppliers. Our private label portfolio consists of (i) our amniotic membrane product line that includes AmBioChoice and AmBioChoice Plus; (ii) our internal fixation product line for foot and ankle procedures, which includes small bone screws and the FuseFix Hammertoe implant; and (iii) our cervical and lumbar interbody spacer product line that features titanium-coated surfaces to promote bone in-growth during spinal fusion surgeries.
 Public Recognition
 Our acquisition of CPM significantly expanded our product lines, operations, and competitive reach. Fuse was named and ranked fifty-sixth (56th) on th
e Deloitte’s 2018 Technology Fast 500TM, an annual ranking of the fastest growing North American
 companies in the technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy technology sectors. We were also named and ranked the one

hundred forty-third (143rd) largest public company by revenue in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, by the Dallas Morning News in August 2018.
 Customer Base and Product Distribution Channels
 We primarily resell products that we acquire either directly from medical device manufacturers or from authorized distributors. We use two (2) retail distribution models to distribute our products to hospitals and surgical facilities including (i) direct employed and contracted sales representatives, and (ii) commission-paid sub-distributors (the “Retail Model”). Further, we use a wholesale distribution model with independent sub-distributors (the “Wholesale Model”). Under our Retail Model, our representatives and commission-paid sub-distributors use their business contacts to expand and establish relationships to build our target medical facility customer base. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our Retail Model generated, in aggregate, approximately eighty-two percent (82%) and sixty-four percent (64%), respectively, of our revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our Wholesale Model generated, in aggregate, approximately eighteen percent (18%) and thirty-six percent (36%), respectively, of our revenues. 
 Our largest customers are hospitals and surgical facilities, and our largest customer represents approximately twenty percent (20%) of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We continue to develop and expand our customer portfolio through building relationships with key medical professionals in the geographic areas we serve. We provide on-going product training and support to our sales representatives and independent contractors along with product manufacturer marketing materials to ensure customer satisfaction with the products we offer. We believe focusing on these key areas is essential to growing our customer base and revenues.
 Competition
 As a national distributor, we primarily compete with other distributors, as well as large, vertically-integrated medical device manufacturers that enjoy well-established distribution channels, national sales networks, direct sales models, and participation in large group purchasing organizations contracted with major hospitals and surgery centers.
 We believe that our status as the Manufacturer and distributor of FDA-approved Maxim X-Treme System, sets us apart from other distributors and gives us a competitive advantage against distributors who are not able to manufacture their own products. 
 Generally, we view Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew, and Orthofix International, N.V., as examples of our vertically-integrated competitors. We believe those competitors, and companies like them, only distribute products they manufacture and have significant costs related to research and development and organizational support. Conversely, we sell a broad portfolio of specialized third-party manufacturers’ products and have no costs related to research and development for such third-party products, nor do we have similar costs for organizational support since we are not vertically-integrated. Thus, we believe our competitive advantage lies primarily with our single-source fulfillment sales model, allowing us to offer a broader assortment of several manufacturers’ products. Furthermore, as a manufacturer for some medical devices, we do not have significant costs associated with research and development or organizational support. Thus, we generally see immediate increases in revenues because of the increased gross margins afforded by the lower costs associated with being a manufacturer. Accordingly, the compensation packages we offer to our employed sales team have higher-earning potentials than the compensation packages our competitors offer, allowing us to attract and retain talented and experienced employees.
 We contract primarily with small- and medium-sized manufacturers of Orthopedic Implants that are subject to FDA compliance and approval standards. These manufacturers are highly innovative and cost effective because of their streamlined sales infrastructures. Because of our organizational structure, large distribution footprint, and our sales model, we tend to align well with our specialized suppliers’ competitive strategies, which we believe results in more partnerships with such suppliers than our competitors, because we can purchase large quantities of their product as a wholesale customer.
 We believe the competition in our industry is primarily caused by continued mergers and acquisitions of smaller distributors by larger, vertically-integrated companies that produce, market and distribute medical devices, Orthopedic Implants, and Biologics. Our vertically-integrated competitors benefit from their ability to control costs for the devices they manufacture and distribute. Moreover, the market in which we operate is sensitive to changes in third-party and government reimbursements and, to a lesser degree, competitive discount pricing. We believe that our industry will continue to see increased mergers and acquisitions because the market is significantly fragmented with numerous medical device distributors and specialized suppliers offering similar product portfolios throughout the United States.

Intellectual Property
 We pursue strategic alliances and partnerships through intellectual property (“IP”) license agreements, and secure key purchase agreements from suppliers to build upon our portfolio of IP.
 We also maintain stocking distribution agreements providing for exclusive distribution rights in certain geographic areas and use of associated trademarks, service marks, and tradenames for the sale and promotion of the products we offer, which generally have durations of one (1) to three (3) years, subject to renewal terms. Furthermore, we require leased employees, independent contractors, consultants, and advisors to execute agreements, with varying terms of one (1) to three (3) years, that assign to us the IP existing and generated from their work. We believe our IP and exclusive distribution agreements provide us with important competitive advantages by (i) increasing our brand awareness and the brand awareness of the products we distribute; and (ii) ensuring that we use the latest design and manufacturing technology for our products that are perceived to be important to our customers.
Regulatory Issues
 Our business is subject to highly complex United States federal and state regulations that may impact our ability to fully implement our strategic plans and initiatives. We are required to obtain and hold licenses and permits and to comply with the regulatory requirements of various governmental agencies. If we fail to comply with such regulatory requirements or if allegations are made that we fail to comply with such regulations, the economic viability of our Company may be adversely affected.
 FDA Regulations
 The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, other federal governmental agencies, and state authorities. These laws and regulations govern the approval of, clearance of, or license to commercialize medical devices (such as Orthopedic Implants), and Biologics. This includes compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, and sales of the products, record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections, and recalls and other matters. As a distributor, marketer, and now, an FDA-registered medical device specification developer and repackager/relabeler of such FDA-regulated products, we are subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products. We may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with requirements that apply to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with those applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as fines, civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecutions. To support our Biologics product lines, we are a registered establishment with the FDA for the storage and distribution of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps).
 Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 We are required to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. Such healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to the relationships that we and our distributors have with healthcare professionals and entities, such as physicians and hospitals. U.S. federal health care laws including laws related to false claims, health care fraud and abuse, physician self-referrals, and anti-kickbacks apply when we or are customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded health care programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid). In comparable fashion, state health care laws of a similar nature apply to state-funded health care programs and may also apply with private third-party payors. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations, substantial fines, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal sanctions. Such sanctions and damages could adversely affect the economic viability of our Company. 
 We instituted a company-wide compliance program for all employees, vendors, and contractors. During 2018, we hired a compliance officer who is responsible for developing compliance programs, reviewing our policies, overseeing adherence to those policies, and advising management on possible risks. Our policies related to this realm include general ethical business practices as well as specific operating policies and training to ensure compliance with relevant and applicable healthcare laws and regulations that include the laws referenced above in addition to other applicable laws
, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended
 (“HIPPA”)
 and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
