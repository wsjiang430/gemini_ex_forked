ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Business Overview 
 
With respect to this discussion, the terms, the “Company” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Nocera, Inc. (“Nocera”), and its 100%-owned subsidiary Grand Smooth Inc Limited. (“GSI”), GSI’s wholly-owned subsidiary Guizhou Grand Smooth Technology Ltd. (“GZ GST”) and its Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), Guizhou Wan Feng Hu Intelligent Aquatic Technology Co. Limited. (“GZ WFH”). 

 
Our History
 
Nocera, Inc. was organized on February 1, 2002 under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
On February 12, 2002, we acquired Felice Conserve, an Italian corporation, as a wholly- owned subsidiary in exchange for 20 million shares of our common stock. The principal business of Felice Conserve was the production and processing of agricultural products in Italy. The principal product was canned tomatoes. 
 
In 2003, we established two subsidiaries in Uruguay; Sontemar, SA (“Sontemar”), and Noldicor, SA (“Noldicor”). The principal business of Noldicor was the production of tomatoes. The principal business of Sontemar was the processing and sale of packaged tomatoes. On April 23, 2004, we paid a 4 for 1 stock dividend to our shareholders.
 
The Company abandoned operations in 2005. In 2006, due to financial difficulties, Noldicor and Sontemar ceased operations. As a result of this, our operations in Uruguay ceased. Additionally, during 2006, Felice Conserve was divested back to its original shareholders. This resulted in our returning to development stage status.
 
On approximately November 3, 2017, we effected a reverse-split of our common stock as follows:
 

· | A 1 for 40,000 reverse-split of the Company’s common stock, followed immediately by;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All fractional shares shall be rounded upwards to the nearest whole share, followed immediately by;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A 200 for 1 forward stock split.
--+---------------------------------

 
The net effect of these actions was a 1 for 200 reverse-split of the Company’s common stock, with no shareholder being reduced below 200 shares. All shareholders who prior to the reverse-split had 40,000 or less of the pre-split shares received 200 of the new, post-split shares. 
 
Effective December 31, 2018, we completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), with (i) Grand Smooth Inc Limited, a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong, China (“GSI”), (ii) GSI’s shareholders, Yin-Chieh Cheng and Bi Zhang, who together owned shares constituting 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of GSI (the “GSI Shares”) and (iii) GSI Acquisition Corp. Under the terms of the Agreement, the GSI Shareholders transferred to us all of the GSI Shares in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, we are a public company holding a subsidiary in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) engaged in aquaculture consulting and management business. We did not cancel or retire any shares of our issued and outstanding common stock and as a result, we have 12,349,200 shares of common stock issued and outstanding following the Share Exchange.
 
As of the Effective Date of December 31, 2018 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we are deemed to have consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired all of the GSI Shares in exchange for the issuance of the shares to the GSI Shareholders. As a result of the Share Exchange, we emerged from shell status with our subsidiary, GSI, in Hong Kong engaged in the aquaculture consulting and management business through VIE in PRC under legal and accounting principles.

Corporate Structure
 
Our current corporate structure is set forth below:



Until we consummated on the Agreement and Plan of Merger effective December 31, 2018, we were a shell company that had no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets. Our wholly owned subsidiary, GSI, was incorporated in Hong Kong, China on August 1, 2014. GSI is the parent holding company of GZ GST, which was established on November 13, 2018 as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (“WFOE”) established in the People’s Republic of China. GZ WFH, the VIE, was established on October 25, 2017, which was contractually controlled by the WFOE through VIE agreements. We will operate our business in China through both the WFOE and its VIE.
 
The WFOE is the primary beneficiary of the VIE – namely has the majority interest in the VIE and through execution of VIE contracts, the WFOE has contract commitments that the financial information of the VIE should be consolidated based on the Variable Interest Ownership percentage owned by the WFOE. The VIE structure was adopted mainly because the China operating company may in the future engage in business that may require special licenses in China and which can be an industry that prohibits foreign investment. The VIE structure will bypass the licensing and prohibition requirements in China.
 
VIE contracts are as follows:
 

1. | Voting Rights Proxy Agreement
---+------------------------------


2. | Equity Pledge Agreement
---+------------------------


3. | Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement
---+-----------------------------------------


4. | Exclusive Call Option Agreement

We believe that our offerings of Services provide the following:
 

i. | Design, install, build and manage aquaculture investment and projects for qualified investors or part of an investment group who is interested in the great potential of the aquaculture industry and whom want to develop or take part of a new commercial fish farming or shrimp farming project but lack the experience.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | A full range of pilot and management services to aquaculture companies and new aquaculture projects throughout China and potentially international. From the fish farm to the table, we intend to encourage and support clean water and clean fish products.

We believe our experience and innovation from working closely with our clients in the aquaculture industry in China gives us the competitive advantages to provide innovative aquaculture management solutions that will generate positive results for our future client companies, however, there can be no assurances we will be successful.
 
Market Overview
 
The fish farming industry in China was predominately regulated by state and local government allowing local fish farmers to set up fish nests in public water including water dams, rivers, lakes and etc. It is the dominant source of freshwater fish for both domestic demands and exports. Since the clean water policy was implemented in China in 2017 by the central government, the state and local governments are tasked with cleaning up local water sources and banning all fish nets and fish nests in public waters. The City of Xing Yi, for example, used to produce 15,000 tons of freshwater fish a year, however, that has been all banned and the government subsidy terminated so that now the 300 million pounds of freshwater fish are no longer produced.
 
This is a countrywide effort where some ponds or lakes are removed immediately and some will phase out gradually in 2 to 3 years. Nevertheless, under China’s government clean water policy of “retreating from lakes to lands” for fish farming, we believe that this presents to us a great opportunity for introducing fish farming in containers (both rectangular and cylinder) on lands. It was introduced in 2015 as a new and extremely simple way for local farmers to breed fish in China. It is also known as “container fish-farming for dummies”. Generating up to 35 times of fish harvest per square meter compared to traditional fish farms in the pond, it also conserves the ecosystem of lakes, reduces local poverty, and protects the species from natural disasters.
 
Domestic demand in China is increasing the number of aquaculture projects and investment, therein. Our Aquaculture solution is innovative and environmentally friendly using a state-of-the-art water recycling and filtration system. We estimate the domestic demand in China could be over 10,000 containers, both cylinder and rectangular, in the next 5 years and globally. We believe that there could be a demand for 15,000 containers.
 
Today, China is faced with the growing challenge of reducing and controlling water pollution that presents serious health risks to its population and damages the environment. We believe that our Aquaculture container fish farm represents a large-scale, environmentally friendly and economically feasible form for bringing clean fish to the table and bringing clean water back to the people. In our opinion, our service is cost competitive, reduces water pollution and recycles fish waste and will help make for a greener China and better world in the years to come.
 
Strategy
 We aim to become a global leader, starting from China, in the field of land-based aquaculture business. We believe following strategies are the critical to achieve this goal:

Continue to cooperate with China International Marine Container Corporation (“CIMC”)
 On October 25, 2017, Guizhou Wan Feng Hu Intelligent Aquatic Technology Co., Ltd. was established with 5% shares held by Dongguan China International Marine Container Corporation, a subsidiary of CIMC. This is a strategic alliance where CIMC subcontracted to us to design, manufacture and install our recirculating aquaculture systems (“RAS”).
 
Focus on the countries with growing population and growing demand for food
 By 2050 we’ll need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s growing population. There is a growing need for new ways to produce high-quality local fish without putting more pressure on our natural ecosystems. Like China, there are also many countries with growing population and growing demand for high-protein food. We plan to go global through building demo sites promoting our RAS and selling our price-competitive systems in these countries for their demand for food and greener environment.
 
Customers
 
Currently we have a firm order to build 800 sets of 2 meters high by 8 meters wide cylindrical fish farming containers that we received from Dong Guan CIMC Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd (“DG CIMC”), which holds 5% non-controlling interest of GZ WFH, and Shen Zhen CIMC Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd (“SZ CIMC”) in 2018. Both DG CIMC and SZ CIMC are subsidiaries of China International Marine Container Corporation (“CIMC”). We estimate this order to be valued at approximately $8.2 million and we have already delivered 473 sets during the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to deliver these sets throughout 2019.
 
In 2019, we intend to target customers in a variety of markets, such as individual investors, government supported or funded companies and international customers. We have received interest from areas like Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. In addition, an increasing amount of Chinese state and local offices are faced with environmental challenges in public waters and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce water pollution, so our potential target customers are significant. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the net sales were $4.8 million and nil, respectively.
 
Suppliers
 
We intend to purchase raw materials and electrical parts and equipment from third parties in the PRC and resell and install to customers. We are not directly involved in the production or manufacturing of this equipment and we do not take a risk in the repair and maintenance of this equipment because of the manufacturer’s maintenance policy but may provide maintenance personnel. Three suppliers accounted for 49.0% in total, and no supplier accounted for over 10% of our total purchase amount during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Presently, our relationships with suppliers are generally good and we expect that our suppliers will be able to meet the anticipated demand for our products in the future.
Competition
 
The market for aquaculture projects and services is highly competitive. Many of the producers and sellers are large entities that have significantly greater resources than we have. Therefore, we are partnering with CIMC to use their resources and hopefully gain a more competitive advantage. We also compete with small suppliers which provide smaller alternative aquaculture solutions regionally but due to the size of our projects, we believe that we should have a better price point.
Trademarks and Patents
 
None

Government Regulation
 
Our business depends in part on environmental regulations and programs in China that promote cleaner water sources to restore clean water back to people. Our customers may be encouraged with incentives by the local governments relating to aquaculture investment. The approvals of land, licenses or permits, are required from relevant central and local government authorities. In addition, from time to time, relevant government authorities may impose new regulations at a local level regulating fish farming. We believe that we have skills to help our customers obtain all necessary licenses, registrations, and permits to comply with all requirements necessary to allow our customers and investors to conduct aquaculture business in the PRC.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are currently not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings and are not aware of any pending or threatened legal or administrative proceedings against us in all material aspects. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business.
Property
 
We do not own any real property.
 
Seasonality
 
Since we have a strategic alliance with the China International Marine Container Corporation (“CIMC”) and our fish farming systems provide a controlled and traceable environment for species, our business rarely suffers a seasonal impact.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we have 13 full-time employees. We are compliant with local prevailing wage, contractor licensing and insurance regulations, and have good relations with our employees.
