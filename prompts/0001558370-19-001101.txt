     ITEM 1.              BUSINESS
 Janus Henderson Group plc (“JHG” or “the Group”), a company incorporated and registered in Jersey, Channel Islands, is an independent global asset manager, specializing in active investment across all major asset classes.
 On May 30, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), JHG (previously Henderson Group plc (“Henderson”)) completed a merger of equals with Janus Capital Group Inc. (“JCG”) (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, JCG and its consolidated subsidiaries became subsidiaries of JHG.
 JHG is a client‑focused global business with approximately 2,300 employees worldwide, and assets under management (“AUM”) of $328.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. JHG has operations in North America, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Continental Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia. JHG focuses on active fund management by investment managers with unique individual perspectives, who are free to implement their own investment views, within a strong risk management framework.
 JHG manages a broad range of actively managed investment products for institutional and retail investors across five capabilities: Equities, Quantitative Equities, Fixed Income, Multi‑Asset and Alternatives.

 Clients entrust money to JHG — either their own or money they manage or advise on for their clients — and expect the Group to deliver the benefits specified in their mandate or by the prospectus for the fund in which they invest. JHG measures the amount of these funds as AUM. Growth in AUM is a key objective of the Group. AUM increases or decreases primarily depending on its ability to attract and retain client investments, on investment performance, and as a function of market and currency movements. To the extent that the Group invests in new asset management teams or businesses or divests from existing ones, this is also reflected in AUM.
 Clients pay a management fee, which is usually calculated as a percentage of AUM. Certain investment products are also subject to performance fees, which vary based on a product’s relative performance as compared to a benchmark index. The level of assets subject to such fees can positively or negatively affect JHG’s revenue. As of December 31, 2018, performance fees were generated from a diverse group of funds and accounts. Management and performance fees are the primary drivers of the Group’s revenue. JHG believes that the more diverse the range of investment strategies from which management and performance fees are derived, the more successful its business model will be.
 Investment Offerings
 Equities
 The Group offers a wide range of equity strategies encompassing different geographic focuses and investment styles. The equity teams include those with a global perspective, those with a regional focus — United States (“U.S.”), Europe and Asia — and those invested in specific sectors. These teams generally apply processes based on fundamental research and bottom‑up stock picking. Quantitative Equities
 The Intech Investment Management LLC (“Intech”) business applies advanced mathematics and systematic portfolio rebalancing intended to harness the volatility of movements in stock prices — a reliable source of excess returns and risk control. With more than 30 years of volatility expertise, the Intech team employs a distinctive quantitative approach based on observations of actual price movements, not on subjective forecasts of companies’ future performance. Fixed Income
 JHG’s Fixed Income teams provide coverage across the asset class, applying a wide range of innovative and differentiated techniques in support of a variety of investment objectives and risk criteria. These teams include those adopting global unconstrained approaches through to those with more focused mandates — based in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Australia. The capabilities of these teams can be accessed through individual strategies and are combined where appropriate to form multi‑strategy offerings.
 Multi‑Asset
 JHG Multi‑Asset includes teams in the U.S. and UK. Included are balanced, multi-asset income and strategic asset allocation, as well as multiple adaptive asset allocation strategies.  
 Alternatives
 JHG Alternatives includes teams with different areas of focus and approach. Diversified Alternatives brings together a cross‑asset class combination of alpha generation, risk management and efficient beta replication strategies. These include Diversified Alternatives, including Global Multi-Strategy, Managed Futures, Risk Premia and Global Commodities; Agriculture; and Long/Short Equity. Additionally, the management of the Group’s direct UK commercial property offering is sub advised by Nuveen Real Estate.

 Distribution
 Distribution Channels
 JHG distributes its products through three primary channels: intermediary, institutional and self‑directed. Each channel is discussed below.
 Intermediary Channel
 The intermediary channel distributes mutual funds, separately managed accounts (“SMAs”), exchange‑traded funds (“ETFs”), UK Open Ended Investment Companies (“OEICs”), Société d’Investissement À Capital Variable (“SICAV”) and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”), through financial intermediaries including banks, broker‑dealers, financial advisors, fund platforms and discretionary wealth managers. Significant investments have been made to grow the Company’s presence in the financial advisor subchannel, including increasing the number of external and internal wholesalers, enhancing the Company’s technology platform and recruiting highly seasoned client relationship managers. At December 31, 2018, AUM in the intermediary channel totaled $143.1 billion, or 44% of total Group AUM. Institutional Channel
 The institutional channel serves corporations, endowments, pension funds, foundations, Taft‑Hartley funds, public fund clients and sovereign entities, with distribution direct to the plan sponsor and through consultants. At December 31, 2018, AUM in the institutional channel totaled $129.0 billion, or 39% of total Group AUM.
 Self‑Directed Channel
 The self‑directed channel serves existing individual investors who invest in JHG products through a mutual fund supermarket or directly with JHG. Exchange‑traded notes (“ETNs”) associated with the VelocityShares brand are also part of the self‑directed channel, although they are targeted at sophisticated institutional and other investors. At December 31, 2018, AUM in the self‑directed channel totaled $56.4 billion, or 17% of total Group AUM.
 While JHG seeks to leverage its global model where possible, it also recognizes the importance of tailoring its services to the needs of clients in different regions. For this reason, JHG maintains a local presence in most of the markets in which it operates and provides investment material that takes into account local customs, preferences and language needs. JHG has a global distribution team of over 600 client‑facing staff.
 JHG’s brand proposition centers on the value that the firm offers through active management and the concept of Knowledge. Shared, which leverages the Group’s deep pool of intellectual capital to deliver investment thought leadership and transparency to clients, thereby building and strengthening trusted relationships.
 Products and Services
 The Group’s global product team maintains oversight of a broad range of products, including locally domiciled pooled funds in the U.S., the UK, Luxembourg, Japan, Singapore and Australia; hedge funds; segregated mandates and closed‑ended vehicles. The team provides governance for all funds and strategies, and gauges the suitability of new offerings as well as ensuring that existing products remain suited to the clients to which they are marketed. Intellectual Property
 JHG has used, registered and/or applied to register certain trademarks, service marks and trade names to distinguish the Group’s sponsored investment products and services from those of its competitors in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S., the UK, the European Union (“EU”), Australia, China, Japan and Singapore. These trademarks, service marks and trade names are important to JHG and, accordingly, the Company enforces its trademark, 

 
  5

 
service mark and trade name rights. The Group’s brand has been, and continues to be, extremely well received both in the asset management industry and with clients.
 Seasonality
 JHG’s revenue streams are not seasonal in nature, with management fees and other income generally accruing evenly through the year. Performance fees are recognized when the prescribed performance hurdles have been achieved and it is probable that the fee will be earned as a result. The hurdles generally coincide with the underlying fund year ends. Given the uncertain nature of performance fees, they tend to fluctuate from period to period. Finance income includes interest received and investment income. While interest received accrues over the year, investment income, which includes movements in seed capital investments, can fluctuate from period to period. This fluctuation depends upon how that particular investment performs each month. Competition
 The investment management industry is relatively mature and saturated with competitors that provide services similar to JHG. As such, JHG encounters significant competition in all areas of its business. JHG competes with other investment managers, mutual fund advisers, brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, hedge funds, venture capitalists, banks and other financial institutions, many of which are larger, have proprietary access to certain distribution channels, have a broader range of product choices and investment capabilities, and have greater capital resources. Additionally, the marketplace for investment products is rapidly changing, investors are becoming more sophisticated, the demand for and access to investment advice and information is becoming more widespread, passive investment strategies are becoming more prevalent, and more investors are demanding investment vehicles that are customized to their individual requirements.
 JHG believes its ability to successfully compete in the investment management industry significantly depends upon its ability to achieve consistently strong investment performance, provide exceptional client service and strategic partnerships, and develop and innovate products that will best serve its clients.
 Regulation
 The investment management industry is subject to extensive federal, state and international laws and regulations intended to benefit and protect investment advisory clients and investors in pooled investment vehicles, such as those managed, advised or subadvised by JHG. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations have significantly increased and may continue to contribute significantly to the costs of doing business as a global asset manager. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of businesses and to impose sanctions for failure to comply with laws and regulations. Possible consequences for failure to comply include, but are not limited to, voiding of investment advisory and subadvisory agreements, the suspension of individual employees (particularly investment management and sales personnel), limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of registrations, disgorgement of profits, and imposition of censures and fines. Further, failure to comply with such laws and regulations may provide the basis for civil litigation that may also result in significant costs and reputational harm to JHG.
 U.S. Regulation
 Certain of JHG’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations from a number of government agencies and self-regulatory bodies, including, but not limited to, the SEC, the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).
 Investment Advisory Laws and Regulations
 Certain subsidiaries of JHG are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and, as such, are regulated by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous and pervasive obligations, including, among others, 

 
  6

 
recordkeeping requirements, custodial obligations, operational procedures, registration and reporting requirements, and disclosure obligations. Certain employees of JHG are also registered with regulatory authorities in various states, and thus are subject to the oversight and regulation by such states’ regulatory agencies.
 Investment Company Laws and Regulations
 Certain of JHG’s subsidiaries act as the adviser or subadviser to mutual funds and ETFs, which are registered with the SEC pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Certain of JHG’s subsidiaries also serve as adviser or subadviser to investment products that are not required to be registered under the 1940 Act. As an adviser or subadviser to pooled investment vehicles that operate under exemptions to the 1940 Act and related regulations, including, among others, requirements relating to operations, fees charged, sales, accounting, recordkeeping, disclosure and governance. In addition, the adviser or subadviser to a registered investment company generally has obligations with respect to the qualification of the registered investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
 Broker‑Dealer Regulations
 JHG’s subsidiary Janus Distributors LLC dba Janus Henderson Distributors (“JHD”) is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act and is a member of FINRA, the U.S. securities industry’s self‑regulatory organization. JHD is a limited-purpose broker-dealer, which acts as the general distributor and agent for the sale and distribution of shares of U.S. mutual funds that are sponsored by certain of JHG’s subsidiaries, as well as the distribution of certain exchange‑traded products (“ETPs”) and other pooled investment vehicles. The SEC imposes various requirements on JHD’s operations, including disclosure, recordkeeping and accounting. FINRA has established conduct rules for all securities transactions among broker‑dealers and private investors, trading rules for the over‑the‑counter markets and operational rules for its member firms. The SEC and FINRA also impose net capital requirements on registered broker‑dealers.
 JHD is subject to regulation under state law. The federal securities laws prohibit states from imposing substantive requirements on broker‑dealers that exceed those under federal law. This does not preclude the states from imposing registration requirements on broker‑dealers that operate within their jurisdiction or from sanctioning broker‑dealers and their employees for engaging in misconduct.
 ERISA
 Certain JHG subsidiaries are also subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and related regulations to the extent they are considered “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to some of their investment advisory clients. ERISA‑related provisions of the Code and regulations issued by the DOL impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit some transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan that is a client of a JHG subsidiary as well as some transactions by the fiduciaries (and several other related parties) to such plans. CFTC
 Certain JHG subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisers (“CTAs”), and become a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”) in connection with the operation of certain of the Group’s products. The Commodity Exchange Act and related regulations generally impose certain registration, reporting and disclosure requirements on CPOs, CTAs and products that utilize the futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation. The CFTC or NFA may institute proceedings to enforce applicable rules and regulations, and violations may result in fines, censure or the termination of CPO and/or CTA registration and NFA membership.

 Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd‑Frank Act”) was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd‑Frank Act established enhanced regulatory requirements for non‑bank financial institutions designated as systemically important financial institutions (“SIFI”) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). In April 2012, the FSOC issued a final rule and interpretive guidance related to the process by which it will designate non‑bank financial companies, potentially including large asset managers, as SIFI. Since that time, the FSOC has considered and invited comments on the circumstances under which asset managers might present risks to financial stability. While the FSOC still retains discretion to designate asset managers as SIFI, it has not named any non-bank asset managers as SIFI to date. If JHG were designated a SIFI, it would be subject to enhanced prudential measures, which could include capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve, credit exposure and concentration limits, and supervisory and other requirements. These heightened regulatory requirements could adversely affect the Company’s business and operations.  International Regulation
 UK
 The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) regulates certain JHG subsidiaries, products and services offered and managed in the UK. FCA authorization is required to conduct any investment management business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules and guidance under that act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, systems and controls, conduct of business, and interaction with clients and the markets. The FCA also regulates the design and manufacture of investment funds intended for public distribution largely by adoption of European fund directives and, on a more limited basis, those that are for investment by professional investors. Europe
 In addition to the above, certain of the Group’s UK‑regulated entities must comply with a range of EU regulatory measures. Some of these apply directly to UK entities while others have been implemented through member states’ law. They include the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”). MiFID regulates the provision of investment services and conduct of investment activities throughout the European Economic Area. MiFID establishes detailed requirements for the governance, organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre‑ and post‑trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. These requirements were substantially revised and extended to non‑equities from January 3, 2018, as a result of the implementation of the revised MiFID. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (“MiFID II”) has and will have a substantial impact on the EU financial services sector, including on asset managers. The UK has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation, principally via the FSMA and the FCA rules. The other EU member states in which JHG has a presence have also implemented MiFID in their local legal and regulatory regimes.
 The EU’s Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) was required to be transposed into EU member state law by July 2013 with a transitional period until July 2014. AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) that are domiciled and offered in the EU and that are not authorized as retail funds under the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive. JHG has two subsidiaries regulated as Alternative Investment Fund Managers. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing within the EU of all AIFs, including those domiciled outside the EU. In general, AIFMD has a staged implementation up to 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements may restrict AIF marketing and imposes compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, reporting requirements, leverage oversight, valuation, stakes in EU companies, the domicile, duties and liability of custodians, and liquidity management.
 UCITS are investment funds regulated at the EU level under the UCITS Directive V (“UCITS V”). UCITS are capable of being freely marketed throughout the EU on the basis of a single authorization in a member state — so‑called 

 
  8

 
passporting. UCITS V covers a range of matters relating to UCITS, including the fund structure and domicile of UCITS, service providers to UCITS and marketing arrangements.
 Luxembourg
 A JHG subsidiary, Henderson Management S.A. (“HMSA”), is authorized and regulated in Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier as a UCITS management company. Two umbrella funds, Henderson Horizon Fund and Henderson Gartmore Fund, have appointed HMSA as their management company. Henderson Horizon Fund and Henderson Gartmore Fund are OEICs incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg in the form of a SICAV authorized as a UCITS. Singapore
 In Singapore, the Group’s subsidiary is subject to, among others, the Securities and Futures Act, the Financial Advisers Act and the subsidiary legislation promulgated pursuant to these acts, which are administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. JHG’s asset management subsidiary and its employees conducting regulated activities specified in the Securities and Futures Act and/or the Financial Advisers Act are required to be licensed with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Australia
 In Australia, JHG’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies, financial markets and financial services in Australia. ASIC imposes certain conditions on licensed financial services organizations that apply to the Group’s subsidiaries, including requirements relating to capital resources, operational capability and controls. As JHG’s chess depository interests (“CDIs”) are quoted and traded on the financial market operated by the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”), JHG is also required to comply with the ASX listing rules and the ASX Principles. Hong Kong
 In Hong Kong, JHG’s subsidiary is subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”) and its subsidiary legislation, which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among other things, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of dealing in securities and asset management activities and intermediaries. This legislation is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. JHG’s subsidiaries and its employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Japan
 In Japan, the Group’s subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency, which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules.
 These regulatory agencies have broad supervisory and disciplinary powers, including, among others, the power to temporarily or permanently revoke the authorization to conduct regulated business, suspend registered employees, and censure and fine both regulated businesses and their registered employees.
 Many of the non‑U.S. securities exchanges and regulatory authorities have imposed rules (and others may impose rules) relating to capital requirements applicable to JHG’s foreign subsidiaries. These rules, which specify minimum capital requirements, are designed to measure general financial integrity and liquidity, and require that a minimum amount of assets be kept in relatively liquid form.
