Item 1.    Business
Overview
Wayfair is one of the world's largest online destinations for the home. Through our e-commerce business model, we offer customers visually inspired browsing, compelling merchandising, easy product discovery and attractive prices for over fourteen million products from over 11,000 suppliers. 
We are focused on bringing our customers an experience that is at the forefront of shopping for the home online. Our primary target customer is a 35- to 65-year-old woman with an annual household income of $50,000 to $250,000, who we believe is underserved by traditional brick and mortar and other retailers of home goods. Because each of our customers has a different taste, style, purchasing goal, and budget when shopping for her home, we have built one of the largest online selections of furniture, décor, decorative accents, housewares, seasonal decor, and other home goods. We are able to offer this vast selection of products because we hold minimal inventory. We specialize in the home category and this has enabled us to build a shopping experience and logistics infrastructure that is tailored to the unique characteristics of our market.
The delivery experience and overall customer service we offer our shoppers are central to our business. The majority of our products are shipped to customers directly from our suppliers with an increasing proportion flowing through our own logistics network. We have invested considerably in our logistics network and increasingly leverage these capabilities to improve the experience for both customers and suppliers. This network is comprised of CastleGate and the Wayfair Delivery Network ("WDN"). Our CastleGate facilities enable suppliers to forward-position their inventory in our warehouses, allowing us to offer faster delivery. Through WDN, we can directly manage large parcel deliveries via consolidation centers, cross docks and last mile delivery facilities, which, alongside CastleGate, enables us to speed up deliveries, reduce damage and decrease our reliance on third parties. We believe these investments in logistics capabilities result in an enhanced experience for our customers and suppliers. We also believe providing superior customer service is key to delighting our customers. Our customer service locations are staffed with over 2,800 highly-trained sales and service employees located in the United States ("U.S.") and Europe. 
Our co-founders are lifetime tech innovators who have worked together in the commercial Internet sector since 1995. As engineers themselves, they have created a company culture deeply rooted in technology and data. Their significant equity ownership in Wayfair has informed their leadership and allowed them to take a long-term view when building our company. 
The U.S. is currently our largest market, and we continue to scale our international business in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany by building our supplier networks, logistics infrastructure and brand presence in those countries.
Segments 
Our operating and reportable segments are U.S. and International. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment and Geographic Information, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Net revenue of the U.S. segment represented 86% of consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our Industry
The home goods market is large and characterized by specific consumer trends, structural challenges and market dynamics that are shaping the future of our industry.
Addressable Market Size and Growth
We estimate today the annual U.S. market for home goods is approximately $285 billion, of which approximately 13% is sold online. According to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 69 million households in the U.S. with annual incomes between $50,000 and $250,000. Moreover, we believe there are approximately 80 million millennials (which we define as individuals currently between the ages of 19 and 36) in the U.S., many of whom are accustomed to purchasing goods online. As millennials age, start new families and move into new homes, we expect online sales of home goods to increase. In addition, we believe the online home goods market will further grow as older generations of consumers become increasingly comfortable purchasing online. With our presence in Canada and western Europe, we believe we have more than doubled the size of our total addressable market.

Why Home is Different
Home is shopped differently than other retail verticals. Homes are personal expressions of self and identity, which is why many consumers seek uniqueness, crave originality and enjoy the feeling created by home design, furniture and décor. Consumers shopping for home goods often cannot articulate exactly what they are looking for and they rarely know the names of the manufacturer brands they like, as the category is largely unbranded. We believe search-based websites have difficulty serving customers shopping for home products in this more emotional, visual and inspirational manner.
When shopping for the home, consumers desire uniqueness, which requires vast selection. In the market for home goods, consumers with different tastes, styles, purchasing goals and budgets require a broad selection of products and choices. Brick and mortar home goods retailers must balance scale of selection with the challenges of high inventory carrying costs and limited showroom and storage space. To browse a vast selection of products across highly-fragmented brick and mortar retailers, consumers must shop multiple stores. We believe the lack of an easy-to-browse, one-stop shopping experience with massive selection has led to dissatisfaction with brick and mortar home goods shopping. 
Logistics, fulfillment and customer service for home goods products are challenging given the variety of categories and price points and the mix of heavy and bulky items. Home goods often have a low dollar value to weight ratio compared to other categories of retail, therefore requiring a logistics network that is optimized for items with those characteristics. Many consumers also seek first-rate customer service so they are not burdened with managing delivery, shipping and return logistics on their own. However, we believe big box retailers that serve the mass market for home goods are often unable or unwilling to provide this level of service. 
Our Solution - Key Benefits for Our Customers
We offer broad selection and choice. We have one of the largest online selections of furniture, décor, decorative accents, housewares, seasonal décor and other home goods with over fourteen million products from over 11,000 suppliers. We have built a portfolio of over 80 house brands, which offer a curated brand experience, making it easier for customers to discover styles, products and price points that appeal to them.
Convenience and value are central to our offering. We are a one-stop shop for consumers in the home goods category, with pricing designed to be on par with big box retailers and a merchandising experience designed to be on par with specialty retailers. For items shipped from our CastleGate warehouses, we are able to deliver many products to a majority of the U.S. population in 2 days or less.
We give customers inspirational content and an engaging shopping experience. To inspire customers, we produce beautiful imagery and highly-tailored editorial content both in house and through third parties. We use personalization to create a more engaging consumer experience, and we allow customers to create looks they love with tools such as our Idea Boards. More than half of the traffic coming to Wayfair.com is from mobile devices and our investment in mobile allows us to deliver value, convenience and inspiration to consumers anytime and anywhere. Our mobile app also offers customers a powerful way to shop for their home from their home using our "View in Room 3D" augmented reality tool. 
Superior customer service is a core part of the experience we offer shoppers. Our customer service organization has over 2,800 employees who help consumers navigate our sites, answer questions and complete orders. This team helps us build trust with consumers, build our brand awareness, enhance our reputation and drive sales.
Our Solution - Key Benefits for Our Suppliers
We give suppliers cost-effective access to our large customer base. We sell products from over 11,000 suppliers, many of which are small, family-run operations without well-known product brands and without easy retail access to a large customer base. We provide our suppliers with access to our customer base of 15.2 million active customers, enabling them to increase their sales and access the growing e-commerce market.
Suppliers can leverage our technological expertise to drive sales. Our technology platform is designed to allow suppliers to easily provide us with their full product selection. We offer our suppliers a view of our demand and inventory needs via powerful data and analytics. Through our technology platform, we believe many of our suppliers have increased their sales, which has strengthened their loyalty to us. 
Our logistics infrastructure allows us to ship directly to our customers from our suppliers or from our CastleGate warehouses. This fulfillment network is a key component of our custom-built and seamlessly integrated technology and operational platform.

Sites and Brands 
Each of our customers has a different taste, style, purchasing goal and budget when shopping for her home. To help her find the right products for her home, we offer five distinct sites, each with a unique brand identity that offers a tailored shopping experience and rich product selection to a different target audience.
Wayfair: Everything home for every budget. 
Joss & Main: Stylish designs to discover daily. 
AllModern: The best of modern, priced for real life.
Birch Lane: Classic home. Comfortable cost.
Perigold: The widest-ever selection of luxury home furnishings.
Wayfair represents a significant majority of our revenue and is the only one of our sites that also operates internationally, operating as Wayfair.ca in Canada, Wayfair.co.uk in the United Kingdom and Wayfair.de in Germany.
On our sites, we also feature certain products under our house brands, such as Three Posts® and Mercury Row®. Through these house brands, we help our customers navigate our sites to find items quickly that match her particular style and price point. 
"Direct Retail" sales include net revenue generated through the five distinct sites described above. In additional to Direct Retail, we also generate "Other" net revenue through two sources, namely Retail Partners and Wayfair Media Solutions. Retail Partners net revenue is generated from sites operated by third parties. These relationships allow consumers to purchase Wayfair products through the retail partners' websites. We made the strategic decision starting in 2014 to deemphasize this part of our business. Wayfair Media Solutions is a smaller portion of our net revenue that is generated through third-party advertisers that pay for advertisements placed on our sites. Wayfair helps manufacturers, retailers and other advertisers market to our large consumer audience.
Technology
We have custom-built our proprietary technology and operational platform to deliver the best experience for both our customers and suppliers. Our success has been built on a culture of data-driven decision-making, operational discipline and an unwavering focus on the customer. We believe that control of our technology systems and the ability to update them often is a competitive advantage. 
Our team of over 2,300 engineers and data scientists has built a full set of technology solutions specific to the home goods market. Our storefront consists of a large set of tools and systems with which our customers directly interact, that are specifically tuned for shopping the home goods category by mixing lifestyle imagery with easy-to-use navigation tools and personalization features designed to increase customer conversion. We have designed operations software to deliver the reliable and consistent experience consumers desire, with proprietary software enhancing our performance in areas such as integration with our suppliers, our warehouse and logistics network and our customer service centers. Much of our advertising technology was internally developed, including campaign management and bidding algorithms for online advertising. This allows us to leverage our internal data and target customers efficiently across various channels. We also partner selectively with marketing partners where we find solutions that meet our marketing objectives and deliver strong return on investment. 
Much of the underlying infrastructure for storefront, operations and advertising technology is common across all of our sites and countries. Our systems are managed in geographically distributed, highly secure data centers that are engineered for high availability. These systems are monitored 24x7 by our network operations center for performance and security.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts bring new and repeat customers to our sites and help us acquire their email addresses through various paid and non-paid advertising methods. Our paid advertising efforts consist primarily of online channels, including search engine marketing, display advertising, and paid social media, and to a lesser extent direct mail and television advertisements. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media, mobile "push" notifications and email. Upon acquiring a customer or a potential customer's email address, we seek to increase their engagement with our sites and drive repeat purchases. This effort to increase engagement and repeat purchasing is driven by all of our marketing tools, including email marketing efforts and customer retargeting. We rigorously manage our paid marketing efforts towards the goal that each new spending initiative is cost-effective with a measurable return on investment within a short period of time.

Logistics
Our logistics network was built specifically for the home category, where items can be bulky, heavy and prone to damage. Historically, our primary method of fulfillment was a drop-ship network where integration into our suppliers' back-end technology infrastructure allowed us to process an order and send it directly to a supplier's warehouse. We would then arrange for shipment from the loading dock of the supplier's warehouse to the customer's home. Depending on the size of the package, the delivery would be made either through carriers such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, the U.S. Postal Service or third-party line haul trucking companies and third party last mile home delivery agents. An increasing proportion of customer orders are being shipped from our CastleGate warehouses and delivered through our WDN, which includes consolidation centers, cross docks, and last mile delivery facilities. We believe that our proprietary logistics network will help drive incremental sales by delighting our customers with faster delivery times and a better home delivery experience. Over time we believe this network will also lower our costs per order by reducing damage rates and leveraging economies of scale in transportation.
Customer Service
Our customer service team consists of approximately 2,800 Wayfair sales and service consultants and employees located across the U.S. and Europe who are available to help our customers with sales and service via phone, email or online chat. Because we view superior customer service as one of our key values, our sales and service employees receive extensive training as well as competitive compensation and benefit packages. The team consists of generalists as well as specialists who have deeper expertise and training in select areas of our catalog, such as lighting, flooring and upholstery.
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to further improve our leadership in the home goods market by pursuing the following key strategies:

• | continue building our brands by delighting our customers;


• | acquire new customers and increase repeat purchases from existing customers;


• | invest in technology to further improve our customer and supplier experiences;


• | grow certain categories where we under index the broader home goods market today, such as home improvement (e.g. plumbing, lighting and flooring), housewares, seasonal decor and decorative accents;


• | increase delivery speed and lower damage rates through the continued build-out of our proprietary logistics network;


• | continue to expand internationally; and


• | opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions.

Competition
The market for online home goods and furniture is highly competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. While we are primarily focused on the mass market, we compete across all segments of the home goods market. Our competition includes furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers and marketplaces in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, including:

• | Furniture Stores: Ashley Furniture, Bob's Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan, Rooms To Go;


• | Big Box Retailers: Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, IKEA, Lowe's, Target and Walmart;


• | Department Stores: JCPenney and Macy's;


• | Specialty Retailers: Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, TJX, At Home, Williams Sonoma, Restoration Hardware, Arhaus, Horchow, Room & Board, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams;


• | Online Retailers and Marketplaces: Amazon, Houzz and eBay; and


• | International: Leon's, Canadian Tire, John Lewis, Argos, Otto and Home24, in addition to several of the companies listed above who also compete with us internationally.

We believe that the primary competitive factors in the mass market are vast selection, visually inspiring browsing, compelling merchandising, ease of product discovery, price, convenience, reliability, speed of fulfillment and customer service. We believe our technological and operational expertise allows us to provide our customers with a vast selection of goods,

attractive price points, reliable and timely fulfillment, plus superior customer service, and that the combination of these capabilities is what provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 12,124 full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, we rely on independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily in our logistics network. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property, including any trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, patents, trade dress, trade secrets and proprietary technologies, is an important part of our business. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions. We pursue the registration of our trademarks, including "Wayfair" and certain variations thereon, copyrights and domain names in the U.S. and certain foreign locations. We also rely on the protection of laws regarding unregistered copyrights for our proprietary software and certain other content we create. We will continue to evaluate the merits of applying for copyright registrations in the future. We have an issued patent regarding our proprietary technology and a number of additional patent applications. We expect to consider filing patent applications for future technology inventions. We also rely on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. To further protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality and assignment of invention assignment agreements with employees and certain contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, such as suppliers.
Company Information
We began operating as Smart Tech Toys, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation, in May 2002 and changed our name to CSN Stores, Inc. in February 2003. From 2002 through 2011, the Company was bootstrapped by our co-founders and operated as hundreds of niche websites, such as bedroomfurniture.com and allbarstools.com. In March 2008, we formed, and contributed all of the assets and liabilities of CSN Stores, Inc. to a subsidiary, CSN Stores LLC, and we continued operating our business through this Delaware limited liability company. In late 2011, we made the strategic decision to close and permanently redirect over 240 of our niche websites into Wayfair.com. As part of that shift, we changed the name of CSN Stores, Inc. to SK Retail, Inc. and changed our name from CSN Stores LLC to Wayfair LLC. In connection with our initial public offering, we completed a corporate reorganization, as a result of which Wayfair Inc. was formed to be a holding company with no material assets other than 100% of the equity interests in Wayfair LLC and SK Retail, Inc. 
Our executive offices are located at 4 Copley Place, Boston, MA 02116, and our telephone number is (617) 532-6100. Our corporate website address is www.wayfair.com. The information contained in, or accessible through, our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
