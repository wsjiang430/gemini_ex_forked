ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History 
 
The principal activities of Sunrise Real Estate Group, Inc. (“SRRE”) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”) are real estate development and property brokerage services, including real estate marketing services, property leasing services; and property management services in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Our current ownership interests in our various subsidiaries and other entities are set forth in the below organizational chart below.
 
Sunrise Real Estate Development Group, Inc. (“CY-SRRE”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SRRE, was established in the Cayman Islands on April 30, 2004 as a limited liability company. Shanghai Xin Ji Yang Real Estate Consultation Company Limited (“SHXJY”) was established in the PRC on August 20, 2001 as a limited liability company. SHXJY was originally owned by a Taiwanese company, the principal and controlling shareholder of which was Lin Chi-Jung. On June 8, 2004, all the fully paid up capital of SHXJY was transferred to CY-SRRE. On June 25, 2004, SHXJY and two individuals established a subsidiary, namely, Suzhou Xin Ji Yang Real Estate Consultation Company Limited (“SZXJY”) in the PRC and SHXJY held a 90% equity interest in SZXJY at the time.
 
On August 9, 2005, SHXJY sold a 10% equity interest in SZXJY to a company owned by a director of SZXJY, and transferred a 5% equity interest in SZXJY to CY-SRRE. Following the sale and transfer, CY-SRRE effectively held an 80% equity interest in SZXJY. On November 24, 2006, CY-SRRE, SHXJY, a director of SZXJY and a third party established a subsidiary, namely, Suzhou Shang Yang Real Estate Consultation Company Limited (“SZSY”) in the PRC, with CY-SRRE holding a 12.5% equity interest, SHXJY holding a 26% equity interest and the director of SZXJY holding a 12.5% equity interest in SZSY. At the date of incorporation, SRRE and the director of SZXJY entered into a voting agreement that provided that SRRE is entitled to exercise the voting right in respect of his 12.5% equity interest in SZSY. As a result of the voting agreement, SRRE effectively holds 51% of the voting power of SZSY. On September 24, 2007, CY-SRRE sold a 5% equity interest in SZXJY to a company owned by a director of SZXJY. Following the sale, CY-SRRE held a 75% equity interest in SZXJY.
 
In October 2011, SHXJY purchased a 24% interest in Linyi Shang Yang Real Estate Consultation Company Limited (“LYSY”) and acquired approximately 103,385 square meters of land for the purpose of developing the land into villa-style residential housing. On March 6, 2012, SHXJY established a wholly-owned subsidiary, namely Linyi Rui Lin Construction and Design Company Limited (“LYRL”). SHXJY’s 24% equity interest in LYSY was then transferred to LYRL. In agreement with Zhang Shu Qin, who owns 51% of LYSY, we have the right to vote 51% interest and thus have 75% of the voting power of LYSY.
 
LIN RAY YANG Enterprise Ltd. (“LRY”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SRRE, was established in the British Virgin Islands on November 13, 2003 as a limited liability company. On February 5, 2004, LRY established a wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Shang Yang Investment Management and Consulting Company Limited (“SHSY”) in the PRC as a limited liability company. On January 10, 2005, LRY and a PRC third party established a subsidiary, Suzhou Gao Feng Hui Property Management Company Limited (“SZGFH”), in the PRC, with LRY holding 80% of the equity interest in SZGFH. On May 8, 2006, LRY acquired 20% of the equity interest in SZGFH from the third party. Following the acquisition, LRY effectively held 100% of the equity interest in SZGFH. The Company sold SZGFH in 2017.
 
In 2011, we acquired a 49% ownership interest in Wuhan Yuan Yu Long Property Development Company Limited (“WHYYL”). The purpose of this project company is for a development project in Wuhan.
 
SRRE was initially incorporated in Texas on October 10, 1996, under the name of Parallax Entertainment, Inc. (“Parallax”). On December 12, 2003, Parallax changed its name to Sunrise Real Estate Development Group, Inc.
 
On August 31, 2004, SRRE, CY-SRRE and Lin Chi-Jung, an individual and agent for the beneficial shareholder of CY-SRRE, i.e., Ace Develop, entered into an exchange agreement under which SRRE issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock to the beneficial shareholder or its designees, in exchange for all outstanding capital stock of CY-SRRE. The transaction closed on October 5, 2004. Lin Chi-Jung is Chairman of the Board of Directors of SRRE, the President of CY-SRRE and the principal and controlling shareholder of Ace Develop.
 
Also on August 31, 2004, SRRE, LRY and Lin Chi-Jung, an individual and agent for beneficial shareholders of LRY, i.e., Ace Develop, Planet Tech and Systems Tech, entered into an exchange agreement under which SRRE issued 10 million shares of common stock to the beneficial shareholders, or their designees, in exchange for all outstanding capital stock of LRY. The transaction was closed on October 5, 2004. Lin Chi-Jung is Chairman of the Board of Directors of SRRE, the President of LRY and the principal and controlling shareholder of Ace Develop. Regarding the 10 million shares of common stock of SRRE issued in this transaction, SRRE issued 8.5 million shares to Ace Develop, 750,000 shares to Planet Tech and 750,000 shares to Systems Tech.
 
As a result of the acquisition, the former owners of CY-SRRE and LRY hold a majority interest in the combined entity. Generally accepted accounting principles require in certain circumstances that a company whose shareholders retain the majority voting interest in the combined business be treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the acquisition was accounted for as a “reverse acquisition” arrangement whereby CY-SRRE and LRY are deemed to have purchased SRRE. However, SRRE remained the legal entity and the Registrant for Securities and Exchange Commission reporting purposes.

On May 23, 2006, Sunrise Estate Development Group, Inc. changed its name to Sunrise Real Estate Group, Inc.
 
General Business Description 
 
SRRE went through a series of transactions leading to the completion of a reverse merger on October 5, 2004. Prior to the closing of the exchange agreements described in “Corporate History” above, SRRE was an inactive "shell" company. Following the closing, SRRE, through its two wholly owned subsidiaries, CY-SRRE and LRY, has engaged in the property brokerage services, real estate marketing services, property leasing services and property management services in the PRC.
 
The Company recognizes that in order to differentiate itself from the market, it should avoid direct competition with large-scale property developers who have their own marketing departments. Our objective is to develop a niche position with marketing alliances with mid-sized and smaller developers and become their outsourcing marketing and sales agents. This strategic plan is designed to expand our activities beyond our existing revenue base, enabling us to assume higher investment risk and giving us flexibility in collaborating with partnering developers. The plan is aimed at improving our capital structure, diversifying our revenue base, and creating higher values and equity returns.
 
SRRE operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries, CY-SRRE and LRY. CY-SRRE and LRY do not have operations themselves but conduct operations in Mainland China through their respective subsidiaries that are based in the PRC. CY-SRRE operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, SHXJY. LRY operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries, SHSY. SHXJY and SHSY are property agency business earning commission revenue from marketing and sales services to developers. Our company organization chart is as follows:

Our major business is agency sales and real estate development. Additionally, we expand our business to the field of financial activities such as entity investment, fund management, financial services and so on.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, 9% of our net revenues of $763,622 was generated from our brokerage operations. For these services we earned a commission fee calculated as a percentage of the sales prices. We have focused our sales on the entire China market, with a particular focus on secondary cities. To expand our business agencies, we have established subsidiaries and branches in Shanghai, Suzhou and Wuhan.
 
Since we started our agency sales operations in 2001, we have established a reputation as a sales and marketing agency for new projects. With our accumulated expertise and experience, we intend to take a more aggressive role by participating in property investments. We plan to select property developers with outstanding qualifications as our strategic partners, and continue to build strength in design, planning, positioning and marketing services. Beginning in 2012, we commenced our first development project in Wuhan and Linyi and started the initial construction in the first quarter of 2012. In Wuhan, we commenced the construction of Phase 1 of the project in the third quarter of 2012.There are a total of eight buildings. The eight buildings that are open for sale currently have a 90% sales rate. As of May 31, 2019, the project has sold 726 apartment units with an area of 81,221 square meters. All apartment units have been sold and only store fronts on the first floor and parking lots remain on sale.
 
Since October 20, 2014, the Linyi project has constructed 123 units, which encompasses approximately 40% of the gross sales area. Proceeds from sales will be used to finance the construction of the subsequent phases of the project. We are applying for bank loans and other forms of funding. However, there are no assurances we will be able to obtain future financings. As of May 31, 2019, the Linyi project has sold 119 units with a sales area of 45,005 square meters and we have started phase two construction of about 17,000 square meters.
 
SHDEW was established in June 2013 as a skincare and cosmetic company. We own 20.63% of the common stock of SHDEW. The company has made progress in its operations. It has become an ecommerce business with its own app and a membership of over a million members as of December 31, 2018. SHDEW is developing its own skincare products as well as solidifying its position in the ecommerce platform.
 
Business Activities
 
Our main operating subsidiaries, SHXJY and SHSY, have engaged in sales and marketing agency work for newly built property units. We also have developed a network of landowners and developers, allowing us to explore opportunities in property investments.
 
Additionally, we expanded into real estate development in 2011 by establishing LYSY and investing in WHYYL, an unconsolidated affiliate. LYSY has a real estate development project located in Linyi City Economic Development Zone, Shandong Province, PRC, which covers a site area of approximately 103,385 square meters for development of villa-style residential housing buildings. WHYYL is developing a real estate project in Wuhan, with a site area of approximately 27,950 square meters for development of eight high-rise residential buildings.
 
We added a business line in 2015 as part of our service sales. The business line mainly provides business consulting services.
 
Commission Based Services
 
Commission based services refer to marketing and sales agency operations, which provide the following services:
 
a. Integrated Marketing Planning
 b. Advertising Planning & Execution
 c. Sales Planning and Execution
 
In this business, we sign a marketing and sales agency agreement with property developers to undertake the marketing and sales activities of a specific project. The scope of service varies according to clients' needs; it could be a full package of all the above services, a combination of any two of the above services or any single service.
 
9% of our revenue in 2018 was from commission-based services. We secure these projects via bidding or direct appointments. As a result of our relationships with existing clients and our sales track record, we have secured a number of cases from prior clients on subsequent phases of projects.

Normally, before a developer retains us, we evaluate and determine the Average Sales Value of a project. This value will be proposed to the developer, and the parties agree on an Average Sales Value as the basis of our agency agreement. The actual sales price of the project is generally priced higher than the Average Sales Value depending on market conditions. On average, we have been able to sell the property at a small premium over Average Sales Value.
 
Our normal commission structure is a combination of the following:
 a) Base Commission of 1.0% - 1.5% based on the Average sales value.
 b) Surplus Commission of 10% - 30% based on the difference between Average Sales Value and actual sales price.
 
Our wholly owned subsidiaries, SHXJY and SHSY, engage in this sales and marketing phase of our business.
 
Real Estate Development
 
In mid-2011, we established a project company in Wuhan of which we own 49%.

As of May 30, 2019, all residential units have been sold except for commercial shops and underground park units.
 
In October 2011, we established LYSY and own 24% of the company. During the first quarter of 2012, we acquired approximately 103,385 square meters for the purpose of developing villa-style residential housing. We began construction in mid-2012 and as of December 31, 2018 have constructed 123 units, which include all units in phase 1 which we completed construction in May 2015. The sales started in November 2013; we have made sales of 104 units by the end of May 2019. Proceeds from sales will be used to finance the construction of the subsequent phases of the project.

On March 13, 2014, the Company signed a joint development agreement with Zhongji Pufa Real Estate Co. According to this agreement, the Company obtained the right to develop the Guangxin Lu (“GXL”) project, which is located in the Putuo District, Shanghai, PRC. This project covers a site area of approximately 2,502 square meters for the development of one apartment building. Presale began on March 2016, and construction was completed on March of 2017. As of June 14, 2019, the project has sold 79 units with a sales area of 3,967 square meters. There are 18 units subject to presale contract termination out of a total of 97 presale units. The project is preparing for the final acceptance of construction by the government authorities. Regulations issued in 2017 require that all commercial and office buildings be used in accordance to what it was originally intended for when the project registered its plans. Our GXL project was inspected by the government and was found to be in accordance with our originally registered plan. However, as of June 14, 2019, we are waiting for the proper authority to allow continued sale of the units. 
 
On December 6, 2018, the Company established 60% ownership of an investment holding company, Huaian Zhanbao (“HAZB”), for the purpose of possible future real estate development project in Huaian.

Government Regulation
 
In 2017, the Shanghai Municipal Construction and Construction Commission issued the Opinions on the Clarification of Commercial and Office Project (Document 2017 No. 400). This regulation requires all commercial and office buildings be used in accordance to what it was originally intended for when the project registered its plans.

It requires developers to clear the land value-added tax, which have completed development projects and have finished sale, or have sold development projects under construction, to clear the land value-added tax..
 
In December 2009, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Supervision, the Central Government, and five other agencies required issued “Notice Regarding Improving Land Sales and Responsible Management” and required that the initial payment of land purchases be increased to 50% of the purchase price and that the entire purchase price be paid in full within the year. Prior to the announcement, the initial payment was around 20% to 30% of the purchase price.

On January 1, 2010, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation re-imposed the business tax on total proceeds from the resale of certain residential properties held for less than five years. The China Banking Regulatory Authority withdrew its earlier policy and re-imposed a minimum of 40% down payment requirement for mortgages for second housing units purchased by families. On March 8, 2010, the Ministry of Land and Resources issued a circular to further strengthen the supervision on land supply, requiring a real estate developer to pay at least 50% of the land premium within one month and 100% within one year after the land use right contract is executed. On April 17, 2010, the State Council issued the Circular on Firmly Restraining Soaring Housing Prices in Certain Cities. Pursuant to this circular,
 

• | A down payment must be no less than 30% of the purchase price for first self-use housing unit purchases by a family with a gross construction area of more than 90 square meters; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | The minimum down payment for the second housing unit purchased by a family is increased from 40% to 50% and the loan interest rate must be no less than 110% of benchmark lending interest rate; 
• | Down payment for the third or additional housing unit purchased by any family and the loan interest rate must be further increased significantly based on the rate for the first and second housing units, as determined by commercial banks based on their assessment of the risks; 
• | Commercial banks may suspend extending loans to families for their purchases of the third or additional housing units in regions where commercial housing unit prices are too high or have risen too fast or supply of housing units is insufficient. The banks may also suspend extending loans to individuals for their purchase of housing units outside of their registered residence if they cannot furnish evidence of their tax or social insurance premium payment for at least one year locally in the region where the subject housing units are located; and
• | Local governments are allowed to limit the total number of housing units one can purchase in certain period in light of the local situation. 

 
On January 10, 2010, the government established 11 measures to strengthen management of the real estate market to address rising real estate prices. The measures called for an increasing supply of low-cost houses for low-income families and common residential houses, encouraging reasonably priced house buying while limiting purchases for speculation and investment, strengthening real estate project loan risk management and market supervision, speeding up construction of residential housing projects for low-income households, and specifying responsibilities of local governments.
 
In January 2011, the State Council released an additional eight new measures to put downward pressure on property prices by:
 
1) | Requiring local governments to set housing price targets in proportion to local income levels for 2011; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Requiring a business tax for housing sales within 5 years of purchase must be levied on total sales value; 
3) | Strengthening the management of land supply for housing; 
4) | Imposing purchase restrictions in all large and medium-sized cities. Families already owning a residential property are allowed to buy only one more, while those already owning two or more properties are prohibited from purchasing additional properties;
5) | Accelerating the construction of social security residential housings; 
6) | Providing that the down payment ratio for second-home purchases must not be less than 60%, up from 50%, with an interest rate at least 1.1 times of the benchmark rate; 
7) | Improving guidance for the media's housing market coverage; 
8) | Providing for implementation & accountability for local governments over the housing price control targets. 

 
In May 2011, the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) began the “one house, one price” policy which requires developers to enhance its disclosure of the residential properties’ offering prices and available supply volume. This policy is designed to prevent developers from posting false supply volume and prices to fuel speculative price volatility.
 
In July 2011, China’s State Council declared that it will continue to implement tightening policies and expand the housing purchase restrictions to second and third-tier cities.
 
In late February and March 2013, the PRC government issued the “New Five Policies” for administration of the housing market and detailed implementation rules, which signified the PRC government’s strong determination to curb the increase in housing prices by requiring more stringent implementation of the housing price control measures. For example, in the cities where there are existing restrictions on housing sale, if the housing prices are rising fast due to insufficient local housing supply, the local governments are required to take more stringent measures to restrict housing units from being sold to those households that own more than one housing unit.  In these cities, the minimum down payment for the second housing unit purchased by a household may be further increased from 60% and the loan interest rate may be raised to be more than 110% of benchmark lending interest rate, as the local housing price control measures require. The New Five Policies also reiterated and emphasized the implementation of the 20% income tax on capital gain generated from housing unit sale. Following the request of the central government, Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities in China have announced detailed regulations to implement the New Five Policies in late March 2013 to further cool down the local real estate markets.

In July 2012, the Ministry of Land and Resources and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development jointly issued a notice to further tighten the land use administration and seek stricter enforcement of the existing real estate market regulations, which include, in particular, enhanced control over the floor area and plot ratio of land for housing purpose, closer scrutiny on the qualification of land bidders, and strengthened investigation and punishment on land bidding winners who leave land idle for more than one year.
 
Such measures and policies by the government have negatively affected the real estate market and caused a reduction in transactions in the real estate market. While these measures and policies remain in effect, they may continue to depress the real estate market, dissuade would-be buyers from making purchases, reduce transaction volume, cause a decline in average selling prices, and prevent developers from raising the capital they need and increase developers’ costs to start new projects.
