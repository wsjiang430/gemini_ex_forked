Item 1. | Business.

Throughout this report "Mattel" refers to Mattel, Inc. and/or one or more of its family of companies. Mattel is a leading global children’s entertainment company that specializes in the design and production of quality toys and consumer products. Mattel's products are among the most widely recognized toy products in the world. Mattel's mission is to "create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain, and develop children through play." In order to deliver on this mission, Mattel is focused on the following two-part strategy to transform Mattel from a toy manufacturing company into an intellectual property ("IP")-driven, high-performing toy company:

• | In the short- to mid-term, restore profitability by reshaping operations and regain topline growth by growing Mattel's Power Brands (Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends, and American Girl) and expanding Mattel's brand portfolio.


• | In the mid- to long-term, capture the full value of Mattel's IP through franchise management and the development of Mattel's online retail and e-commerce capabilities.

Mattel is the owner of a portfolio of global brands with vast intellectual property potential. Mattel's portfolio of brands and products are classified as Power Brands and Toy Box:
Power Brands include:
Barbie—Empowering girls since 1959, Barbie has inspired the limitless potential of every girl by showing them that they can be anything. With an extensive portfolio of dolls and accessories, content, gaming, and lifestyle products, Barbie is the premier fashion doll for children around the world.
Hot Wheels—In production for over 50 years, Hot Wheels continues to push the limits of performance and design and ignites the challenger spirit of kids, adults, and collectors. From diecast cars, to tracks, playsets, and advanced play products, the Hot Wheels portfolio has broad appeal that engages and excites kids. 
Fisher-Price and Thomas & Friends—An institution in learning and child development for over 85 years, Fisher-Price is driven to enrich children's lives from birth to school readiness, helping families provide their children with the best possible start. Thomas & Friends, a key property in the Fisher-Price portfolio, is an award-winning preschool train brand franchise that brings meaningful life lessons of friendship and teamwork to kids through content, toy, live events, and other lifestyle categories.
American Girl—A beloved brand since the first catalog debuted in 1986, American Girl is best known for imparting valuable life lessons through its inspiring dolls and books, featuring diverse characters from past and present. Its products are sold directly to consumers via its catalog, website, and proprietary retail stores.
Toy Box includes new and innovative products, as well as time-tested classics, from Mattel-owned and licensed entertainment properties: 
Owned Brands—Mattel has an engaging portfolio of owned brands such as MEGA, Polly Pocket, Uno, Enchantimals, Fireman Sam, and Matchbox.

Business Segments
Mattel’s operating segments are separately managed business units, consisting of: (i) North America, which consists of the U.S. and Canada, (ii) International, and (iii) American Girl.  The North America and International segments sell products in both the Power Brands, excluding American Girl, and Toy Box categories, although some are developed and adapted for particular international markets.
For additional information on Mattel’s worldwide revenues by brand category, see Part II, Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information."

North America Segment
The North America segment markets and sells toys in the U.S. and Canada from the Power Brands, excluding American Girl, and Toy Box categories.
In the Power Brands category, 2019 will be a milestone year for Barbie, as the brand celebrates its 60th anniversary by honoring global role models and celebrating firsts for girls and women. In 2019, new product lines will include travel and exploration, and the Fashionistas line will continue to celebrate diversity with even more additions to the line. Barbie products will also continue to be supported by new animated content, including new episodes of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures.
Hot Wheels will launch several core product and marketing initiatives in 2019, including an expansion of the Hot Wheels Legends Tour and the launch of the kid-favorite dinosaur theme for Hot Wheels City. The brand will also launch Hot Wheels Monster Trucks globally, backed by the full-year touring live event Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live in the U.S., and in the fall will launch an exciting partnership with Nintendo’s Mario Kart.
In 2019, Fisher-Price will return its focus to being a partner to parents with infants and children up to five years old through a combination of new product launches and a new brand platform with renewed relevance. Building off of its 89-year heritage of delivering early childhood development through play, Fisher-Price will launch three new categories that provide growth opportunities by leveraging classic play patterns with mixed materials. Thomas & Friends will continue its journey around the world with the fall 2019 release of the twenty-third season of Thomas & Friends: Big World! Big Adventures!, featuring new animated content in which Thomas and the Steam Team will meet new friends and learn about new cultures while traveling farther than ever before, visiting Italy, Brazil, China, Australia, India, and of course—Sodor.
In the Toy Box category, which consists of Owned Brands and Partner Brands, Mattel will continue to focus on developing its owned brands and being a partner of choice for leading entertainment properties by bringing products to the global marketplace with speed and innovation.
Toy Box Owned Brands includes brands such as MEGA, Polly Pocket, and Enchantimals, as well as games and other growth properties. MEGA will be launching a Detective Pikachu product line in spring 2019, based on the May 2019 theatrical release of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.'s Pokemon Detective Pikachu. Building off of its content distribution, Mattel will continue to revitalize its brands Polly Pocket and Enchantimals by streaming animated content on Netflix. Additionally, Polly Pocket animated content will continue streaming on Hulu, allowing for further exposure and connection points to the brand. In the games category, Mattel has a strong slate of new kids and preschool games that will launch in the spring of 2019.
Toy Box Partner Brands will continue to partner with Disney, Warner Bros. Consumer Products, Nickelodeon and NBCUniversal, bringing innovative products to the global marketplace. Key 2019 product lines based on entertainment franchises include Disney’s Toy Story 4 with a theatrical release in June 2019, continued franchise support of NBCUniversal’s Jurassic World, and the highly anticipated global launch of BTS products, modeled after the world's leading South Korean boy band, which has become a cultural sensation with global appeal. 
International Segment
Products marketed by the International segment are generally the same as those developed and marketed by the North America segment, although some are developed or adapted for particular international markets. Mattel’s products are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. No individual country within the International segment exceeded 7% of worldwide consolidated gross sales during 2018.
American Girl Segment
The American Girl segment is a direct marketer, children’s publisher, and retailer dedicated to its mission to help build girls of strong character. American Girl is best known for its line of historical and contemporary characters that feature books, dolls, and accessories that inspire girls with important lessons from America’s past to today. For girls who are ready to tell their own stories, Bitty Baby introduces girls to nurturing play until they are ready for WellieWishers, a sweet group of girls who teach about empathy and being a good friend. Truly Me allows girls to express what’s on their minds and in their hearts by choosing a doll—or creating their own—from more than 1.3 million possibilities. American Girl also publishes best-selling fiction and non-fiction titles that help girls navigate the changes and challenges of growing up. The American Girl segment sells products directly to consumers via its catalog, website, in its proprietary retail stores in the U.S., at select retailers nationwide, and at specialty boutiques and franchise stores in Canada, Dubai, and Bahrain. 
5

In January 2019, American Girl introduced its newest Girl of the Year character, Blaire Wilson, a young chef-in-training who is growing up on her family’s sustainable farm and finds that cultivating sustainable relationships is the key to true happiness. Throughout 2019, American Girl will continue to increase visibility of its exclusive content by continuing the Character Matters brand campaign, which focuses on creating girls of strong character through stories and experiences.
Manufacturing and Materials
Mattel manufactures toy products for all segments in both company-owned facilities and through third-party manufacturers. Products are also purchased from unrelated entities that design, develop, and manufacture those products. To provide greater flexibility in the manufacture and delivery of its products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, Mattel has concentrated production of most of its core products in company-owned facilities and generally uses third-party manufacturers for the production of non-core products.
Mattel’s principal manufacturing facilities are located in Canada, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Thailand. To help avoid disruption of its product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, economic instability, changes in government policies or regulations, and other risks, Mattel produces its products in multiple facilities across multiple countries. Mattel believes that the existing production capacity at its own and its third-party manufacturers’ facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume in the foreseeable future. Mattel continues to evaluate its manufacturing footprint in connection with its Structural Simplification cost savings program.
Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a particular product line. 
The majority of Mattel’s raw materials are available from numerous suppliers but may be subject to fluctuations in price. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Competition and Industry Background
Mattel is a worldwide leader in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of toys, games, and other products related to play, learning, and development. Competition in the toy industry is based primarily on quality, play value, brands, and price. Mattel offers a diverse range of products for children of all ages and families that include, among others, toys for infants and preschoolers, dolls, vehicles, action figures, construction toys, youth electronics, hand-held and other games, puzzles, educational toys, technology-related products, media-driven products, and fashion-related toys. The North America segment competes with several large toy companies, including Hasbro, JAKKS Pacific, Just Play Products, LEGO, MGA Entertainment, Moose Toys, Spin Master, and VTech, many smaller toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. The International segment competes with global toy companies including Famosa, Giochi Preziosi, Hasbro, LEGO, MGA Entertainment, Playmobil, Ravensburger, Simba, Spin Master, and VTech, other national and regional toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. Foreign regions may include competitors that are strong in a particular toy line or geographical area but do not compete with Mattel or other international toy companies worldwide. The American Girl segment competes with companies that manufacture dolls and accessories and with children’s book publishers and retailers. 
Competition among the above companies is intensifying due to trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products and an increasing use of high technology among consumers. As a result of children outgrowing toys at younger ages, Mattel competes with companies that sell non-toy products, such as electronic consumer products, video games, as well as content and other entertainment companies.  Competition continues to be heavily influenced by the fact that a small number of retailers account for a large portion of all toy sales, allocate the shelf space from which toys are viewed, and have direct contact with parents and children through in-store and online purchases. Such retailers can and do promote their own private-label toys, facilitate the sale of competitors’ toys, showcase toys online based on proprietary algorithms, and allocate shelf space to one type of toy over another. Online distributors are able to promote a wide variety of toys and represent a wide variety of toy manufacturers, and, with limited overhead, do so at a lower cost.

Seasonality
Mattel’s business is highly seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of all toy purchases during the traditional holiday season. A significant portion of Mattel’s customers’ purchasing occurs in the third and fourth quarters of Mattel’s fiscal year in anticipation of holiday buying. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattel’s business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of less popular toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers have also been attempting to manage their inventories more tightly in recent years, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase the risk that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that Mattel’s own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers manage their inventories, Mattel experiences cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause its sales to vary significantly from period to period.
In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Seasonal shipping patterns result in significant peaks in the third and fourth quarters in the respective levels of inventories and accounts receivable, which result in seasonal working capital financing requirements. See Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Seasonal Financing and Debt."
Advertising and Marketing
Mattel supports its product lines with extensive advertising and consumer promotions. Advertising takes place at varying levels throughout the year and peaks during the traditional holiday season. Advertising includes television and radio commercials, social media, and magazine, newspaper, and internet advertisements. Promotions include in-store displays, sweepstakes, merchandising materials, major events focusing on products, and tie-ins with various consumer products companies.
During 2018, 2017, and 2016, Mattel incurred expenses of $526.4 million (11.7% of net sales), $642.3 million (13.2% of net sales), and $634.9 million (11.6% of net sales), respectively, for advertising and promotion.
Sales
Mattel’s products are sold throughout the world. Products within the North America segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets, and, to a limited extent, wholesalers. Mattel also operates two small retail outlets at certain corporate offices as a service to its employees and as an outlet for its products. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. Mattel also has retail outlets in Latin America and Europe that serve as outlets for its products. American Girl products and its children's publications are sold directly to consumers and select retailers nationwide. Mattel has 20 American Girl retail stores: American Girl Place in Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, and New York, New York, and American Girl stores in Alpharetta, Georgia, Bloomington, Minnesota, Charlotte, North Carolina, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas, Lone Tree, Colorado, Lynnwood, Washington, McLean, Virginia, Miami, Florida, Nashville, Tennessee, Natick, Massachusetts, Orlando, Florida, Overland Park, Kansas, Palo Alto, California, Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Scottsdale, Arizona, each of which features children’s products from the American Girl segment. Additionally, Mattel sells certain of its products online through websites of one or more of its subsidiaries.
During 2018, Mattel’s two largest customers (Walmart at $1.07 billion and Target at $0.45 billion) accounted for approximately 34% of worldwide consolidated net sales. During 2017 and 2016, Toys "R" Us accounted for $0.40 billion and $0.64 billion, respectively, of worldwide consolidated net sales. Substantially all of Mattel's sales to its two largest customers were in North America. Within countries in the International segment, there is also a concentration of sales to certain large customers that do not operate in the U.S., none of which exceeded 10% of worldwide consolidated net sales. The customers and the degree of concentration vary depending upon the region or nation. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information."
Licenses and Distribution Agreements
Mattel has license agreements with third parties that permit Mattel to utilize the trademark, characters, or inventions of the licensor in products that Mattel sells. A number of these licenses relate to product lines that are significant to Mattel’s business and operations.
7

Mattel has entered into agreements to license entertainment properties from, among others, Disney Enterprises, Inc. (including Star Wars, Mickey Mouse, Jake and the Never Land Pirates, CARS 3 and Toy Story from Pixar, and certain Disney films and television properties), NBCUniversal (including Fast and Furious and Jurassic World), Viacom International, Inc. relating to its Nickelodeon properties (including Dora the Explorer, Blaze and the Monster Machines, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Sunny Day), Warner Bros. Consumer Products (including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Justice League, and DC Comics Superhero Girls), Microsoft (including Halo), Mojang (including Minecraft), and WWE Wrestling. 
Mattel's license with Warner Bros. Consumer Products for the global rights to produce and sell action figures based on DC Comics characters expires in March 2020 and will not be renewed.
Royalty expense for 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $224.0 million, $244.5 million, and $228.9 million, respectively. See "Commitments" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies."
Mattel also licenses a number of its trademarks and other property rights to others for use in connection with the sale of their products. Mattel distributes some third-party finished products that are independently designed and manufactured.
Trademarks, Copyrights, and Patents
Most of Mattel’s products are sold under trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, and some of these products incorporate devices or designs for which patent protection has been, or is being pursued. Trademarks, copyrights, and patents are significant assets of Mattel in that they provide product recognition and acceptance worldwide.
Mattel customarily seeks trademark, copyright, and/or patent protection covering its products, and it owns or has applications pending or registrations for U.S. and foreign trademarks, copyrights, and patents covering many of its products. Although a number of these trademarks, copyrights, and patents relate to product lines that are significant to Mattel’s business and operations, Mattel does not believe it is dependent on a single trademark, copyright, or patent. Mattel believes its rights to these properties are adequately protected, but there can be no assurance that its rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
Commitments
In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into contractual arrangements for future purchases of goods and services to ensure availability and timely delivery and to obtain and protect Mattel’s right to create and market certain products. Certain of these commitments routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the term of the contracts. Current and future commitments for guaranteed payments reflect Mattel’s focus on expanding its product lines through alliances with businesses in other industries. Additionally, Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for premises and equipment used in the normal course of business.
Agreements to purchase inventory, services, and other items with terms extending through 2023 contain future minimum payments totaling approximately $448 million. Licensing and similar agreements with terms extending through 2023 and beyond contain provisions for future guaranteed minimum payments totaling approximately $282 million. Operating lease commitments with terms extending through 2023 and beyond contain future minimum obligations totaling approximately $516 million. See Part II, Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Commitments" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies."
Backlog
Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, which usually request delivery within three months. In the toy industry, orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment. In recent years, a trend toward just-in-time inventory practices in the toy industry has resulted in fewer advance orders and therefore less backlog of orders. Mattel believes that the amount of backlog orders at any given time may not accurately indicate future sales.
8

Financial Instruments
Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact Mattel’s results of operations and cash flows. Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts generally have maturity dates of up to 18 months. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For additional information regarding foreign currency contracts, see "International Segment" above, Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Derivative Instruments."
Seasonal Financing
See Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Seasonal Financing and Debt."
Government Regulations and Environmental Quality
Mattel’s products sold in the U.S. are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and may also be subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these federal and state laws and regulations.
Mattel’s products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
Mattel maintains a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, Mattel has experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on Mattel’s results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect Mattel’s reputation and the sales of other Mattel products. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Mattel’s advertising is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, The Children’s Television Act of 1990, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as laws of certain countries that regulate advertising and advertising to children. In addition, Mattel’s web-based products and services and other online and digital communications activity are or may be subject to U.S. and foreign privacy-related regulations, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation and related national regulations. Privacy-related laws also exist in some U.S. states. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
Mattel’s worldwide operations are subject to the requirements of various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where those operations are located. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with those laws and regulations. Mattel’s operations are from time to time the subject of investigations, conferences, discussions, and negotiations with various federal, state, and local environmental agencies within and outside the U.S. with respect to the discharge or cleanup of hazardous waste. Mattel is not aware of any material cleanup liabilities.
Mattel is subject to various other federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations applicable to its business. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
Employees
The total number of persons employed by Mattel and its subsidiaries at any one time varies because of the seasonal nature of its manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2018, Mattel’s total number of employees was approximately 27,000.
