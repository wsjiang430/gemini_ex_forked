Item 1. Business
BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
HTA, a Maryland corporation, and HTALP, a Delaware limited partnership, were incorporated or formed, as applicable, on April 20, 2006.
HTA is a publicly-traded REIT and one of the leading owners and operators of medical office buildings (“MOBs”) in the United States (“U.S.”). We focus on owning and operating MOBs that serve the future of healthcare delivery and are located on health system campuses, near university medical centers, or in community core outpatient locations. We also focus on key markets that have attractive demographics and macro-economic trends and where we can utilize our institutional full-service operating platform to generate strong tenant and health system relationships and operating cost efficiencies. Our primary objective is to enhance the value of our real estate assets through our dedicated asset management and leasing platform, which generates consistent revenue streams and manageable expenses. As a result of our core business strategy, we seek to generate stockholder value through consistent and growing dividends, which are attainable through sustainable cash flows. 
We invest in MOBs that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare in a changing environment. Healthcare is one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. economy, with an expected average growth rate of approximately 6% annually through 2026. Overall U.S. spending is expected to increase by approximately 20% of gross domestic product (“GDP”) by 2026 according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In addition, healthcare is experiencing the fastest employment growth in the U.S., a trend that is expected to continue over the next decade. These high levels of demand are primarily driven by an aging U.S. population and the long-term impact of an increasing number of insured individuals nationwide. This increase in demand, combined with advances in less invasive medical procedures, is driving many healthcare services to lower costs and to more convenient outpatient settings that are less reliant on hospital campuses. As a result, HTA believes that well-located MOBs should provide stable cash flows with relatively low vacancy risk, resulting in consistent long-term growth.
 Since inception, the Company has invested $6.8 billion primarily in MOBs, development projects, land and other healthcare real estate assets that are primarily located in 20 to 25 high quality markets that possess above average economic and socioeconomic drivers. Our portfolio consists of approximately 23.2 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 68% of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. We believe these key locations and affiliations create significant demand from healthcare related tenants for our properties. Further, our portfolio is primarily concentrated within major U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) that we believe will provide above-average economic growth and socioeconomic benefits over the coming years. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets and approximately 93% of our portfolio, based on GLA, is located in the top 75 MSAs, with Dallas, Houston, Boston, Tampa and Atlanta being our largest markets by investment.
Our principal executive office is located at 16435 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 320, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, and our telephone number is (480) 998-3478.

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 
Corporate Strategies 
Invest in and Maintain a Portfolio of Properties that are Valuable for the Future of Healthcare Delivery 
The Company is focused on investing in and maintaining a real estate portfolio that consists of well-located MOBs that allow for the efficient delivery of healthcare over the long-term. To date, we have invested $6.8 billion to create one of the largest portfolios (based on GLA) of healthcare real estate that is focused on the MOB sector in the U.S. We look to allocate capital to properties that exhibit the following key attributes: 

• | Located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems in the U.S. We seek to invest in properties that have long-term value for healthcare providers, including those that benefit from their proximity to and/or affiliation with prominent healthcare systems. These healthcare systems typically possess high credit quality and are capable of investing capital into their campuses. We believe our affiliations with these health systems helps ensure long-term tenant demand. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 68% of our portfolio was located on the campuses of, or adjacent to, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems. 


• | Located in core community outpatient locations. We seek to invest in properties that will have long-term value for healthcare providers, including those that are located in key outpatient medical hubs. These properties benefit from their proximity to attractive patient populations, maintain a mix of physician practices and specialties, and are convenient for patients and physicians alike. In addition, these properties and medical hubs can be centers for healthcare away from hospital campuses while benefiting from the advancement of healthcare technology, which allow for lower cost settings, more services and procedures to be performed away from hospitals, and the growing requirement for convenient healthcare. We believe these factors ensure long-term tenant demand. At December 31, 2018, approximately 32% of our portfolio was located in core community outpatient locations. 


• | Attractive markets where we can maximize efficiencies through our asset management and leasing platform. We seek to own MOBs in markets with attractive demographics, economic growth and high barriers to entry which support growing tenant demand. We have developed a strong presence across 20 to 25 key markets since our inception, with approximately 93% of our total GLA located in top 75 MSAs as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we have developed scale in these key markets, reaching approximately 1 million square feet of GLA in nine of our top ten markets, and approximately 0.5 million square feet of GLA in our top 15 markets. Our scale in markets has allowed us to create the largest, institutionally owned asset management platform in the sector, which includes leasing, property management, building maintenance, construction, and development capabilities. In each of these markets, we have established a strong full-service operating platform that has allowed us to develop valuable relationships with health systems, physician practices, universities and regional development firms that have led to investment and leasing opportunities. Our asset management platform utilizes our scale to provide services to our properties at cost effective rates and with a focus on generating cost efficiencies and superior service for our tenants. 


• | Occupied with limited near term leasing risks. We seek to invest in and maintain well-occupied properties that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare within that specific market. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio was 92.0% leased. We believe this creates tenant demand that supports higher occupancy and drives strong, long-term tenant retention as hospitals and physicians are generally reluctant to move or relocate, as evidenced by our Same-Property portfolio tenant retention rate of 81% as of the year ended December 31, 2018. 


• | Diversified and synergistic mix of tenants. Our primary focus is placed on ensuring an appropriate and diversified mix of tenants from different practice types, as well as complimentary practices that provide synergies within both individual buildings and the broader health system campuses. We actively invest in both multi-tenant properties, which generally have shorter-term leases in smaller spaces, and single-tenant properties, which generally have longer-term leases in larger spaces. The multi-tenant buildings provide for lower lease rollover risks in any particular year and typically allow rents to reset to current market rates that may be higher than the in-place rental rates. We believe single-tenant buildings provide steady long-term cash flow, but generally provide for more limited long-term growth. 


• | Credit-worthy tenants. Our primary tenants are healthcare systems, academic medical centers and leading physician groups. These groups typically have strong and stable financial performance, which we believe helps ensure stability in our long-term rental income and tenant retention. As of December 31, 2018, 59% of our annual base rent was derived from credit-rated tenants, primarily health systems. A significant amount of our remaining rent comes from physician groups and medical healthcare system tenants that are credit-worthy based on our internal underwriting and due diligence, but do not have the size to benefit from a formal credit rating by a nationally recognized rating agency.

Internal Growth through Proactive In-House Property Management and Leasing 
Our asset management and leasing platform operated approximately 21.6 million square feet of GLA, or 93% of our total portfolio. This is a significant increase since our public listing on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in 2012 when we managed approximately 8.8 million square feet, or 70%, of our GLA. We believe this direct asset management approach allows us to maximize our internal growth by improving occupancy, achieving operating efficiencies and creating long-term tenant relationships at our properties, resulting in optimized rental rates. Specific components of our overall asset management strategy include:

• | Maintaining regional offices in markets where we have a significant presence. HTA has 29 local offices primarily located within our key markets across the U.S., including its corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona. 


• | Creating local relationships with local healthcare providers, including national and regional healthcare systems, physicians and other providers.


• | Maintaining or increasing our average rental rates, actively leasing vacant space and reducing leasing concessions. These leasing results contributed to an average of 2.5% of Same-Property Cash NOI growth each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2018. 


• | Improving the quality of service provided to our tenants by being attentive to their needs, managing expenses and strategically investing capital to remain competitive within our markets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we achieved tenant retention for the Same-Property portfolio of 81%. 


• | Maintaining a portfolio of high-quality MOBs that we believe are critical to the delivery of healthcare now and in the future, while enhancing our reputation as a dedicated leading MOB owner and operator.


• | Utilizing local and regional economies of scale to focus on operating cost efficiencies for our properties and utilizing our building service operations to generate profits for our stockholders while providing more efficient services.

Key Market Focused Strategy and Investments
We plan to grow externally through targeted investments and developments that improve the quality of our portfolio and are accretive to our cost of capital. To achieve this growth in competitive markets we seek:

• | Targeted property investments, generally located within our key markets. These transactions allow us to focus on the quality of individual properties and ensure they are accretive to our cost of capital. They also allow us to exhibit meaningful growth given our current size. 


• | Long-term relationships with key industry participants. We will continue our emphasis on long-term relationship building as we have since inception. These relationships are cultivated by our senior management team, with key industry participants, including health systems as well as local and regional developers, which have traditionally provided us with valuable investment opportunities. 


• | Local knowledge through our internal full-service operating platform. Our local personnel participate in local industry activities that can provide insightful information with respect to potential opportunities. 

Actively Maintain Conservative Capital Structure 
We have and continue to actively manage our balance sheet to maintain an attractive investment grade credit rating, to maintain conservative leverage and to preserve financing flexibility, which ultimately hedges against inherent risk and provides us with attractive capital sources that allow us to take advantage of strategic external growth opportunities. In addition, we may also strategically dispose of properties that we believe no longer align with our strategic growth objectives in order to redeploy the capital generated by these dispositions into higher yielding MOBs that we believe have better longer-term growth prospects. The strength of our balance sheet is demonstrated by our investment grade credit ratings. To maintain our strong and conservative balance sheet, we:

• | Maintain a low leverage ratio. Our leverage ratio, measured as debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization, was 31.3% as of December 31, 2018. 


• | Maintain a high level of liquidity. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity, primarily consisting of $1.0 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility and $126.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. 


• | Utilize multiple capital sources, including public debt and equity, unsecured bank loans and secured property level debt.


• | Maintain well-laddered debt maturities, which extend through 2027 with no significant exposure in any one year. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our debt portfolio was 5.0 years, including extension options.

HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY
Healthcare Sector Growth
We operate MOBs within the healthcare industry, which are benefiting from several significant macroeconomic drivers, such as an aging population, millennials beginning to form families, and an increase in the insured population. These trends are driving growth in healthcare spending at a rate significantly faster than the rate of growth in the broader U.S. economy. 
The U.S. population is experiencing significant aging of its population, as advancements in medical technology and changes in treatment methods enable people to live longer. This is expected to drive healthcare utilization higher as individuals consume more healthcare as they age. Between 2020 and 2030, the U.S. population over 65 years of age is projected to increase by almost 31% and total over 20% of the U.S. population. Individuals of this age spend the highest amounts on healthcare, averaging more than $6,500 per individual over the age of 65 according to a 2017 Consumer Expenditure Survey. This compares to healthcare expenditures of approximately $1,550 per year for individuals 25 and under. The older population group will increasingly require treatment and management of chronic and acute health ailments. We believe much of this increased care will take place in lower cost outpatient settings, which should continue to support MOB demand in the long term.
In addition, the large millennial generation is just now starting to reach their thirties and form families. During this age period, healthcare expenditures double on average. As this large generation utilizes additional healthcare services, it is expected they will do so in more convenient outpatient settings, typically in MOBs. 
8

The number of insured individuals in the U.S. continues to increase, as the population grows and as a result of the impact of U.S. government actions, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”). Since 1999, the number of individuals covered by healthcare insurance in the U.S. has increased over 23%. Although the current political administration has sought to unsuccessfully repeal the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion remains in place with some states seeking to expand coverage. Thus far, the removal of the individual mandate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) has seen limited impact.
As a result of these factors, the healthcare sector is one of the fastest growing sectors of the U.S. economy and is growing faster than GDP. According to the latest data from 2017, Americans spent nearly $3.5 trillion, or 17.9%, of total GDP, on healthcare expenditures in 2017, an increase of 3.9% over the previous year. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services project that total healthcare expenditures will reach approximately $5.7 trillion by 2026. Healthcare expenditures are projected to grow an average of 5.6% annually through 2026 and account for 19.7% of GDP by 2026. This growth in healthcare expenditures reflects the increasing demand for healthcare. It is also driving demand for cost effective healthcare which generally takes place in outpatient settings such as MOBs.
9

Employment in the healthcare industry has steadily increased for at least 20 years despite three recessions during that period. Healthcare-related jobs are among the fastest growing occupations, projected to increase by 18% between 2016 and 2026, significantly higher than the general U.S. employment growth projection of 7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects ten out of the top twenty occupations with the highest growth for workers will be in the healthcare sector. We expect the increased growth in the healthcare industry will correspond with a growth in demand for MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry.
Medical Office Building Supply and Demand 
MOBs are less susceptible to changes in the general economy than traditional commercial real estate due to secular drivers supporting the healthcare sector and the defensive nature of healthcare expenditures during economic downturns. For this reason, we believe MOB investments provide more consistent rental revenue streams, higher occupancies and tenant retention that could potentially translate into a more stable return to investors compared to other types of real estate investments. We also believe that demand for MOBs will increase due to a number of MOB specific factors, including:

• | The MOB sector is highly fragmented with approximately 11% of the MOBs owned by public REIT investors. There is significant opportunity to expand within the industry given the lack of institutional ownership compared to other real estate sectors. 

10


• | Healthcare delivery continues to shift to outpatient settings driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences and lower costs.


• | An increase in medical office visits due to the overall rise in healthcare utilization which in turn has driven hiring within the healthcare sector. Additionally, the rate of employment growth in physicians’ offices and outpatient care facilities has outpaced employment growth in hospitals during the past decade, further supporting the trend of increased utilization of healthcare services outside of the hospital. This trend is forecast to continue, with the number of healthcare providers, particularly nurses, physicians, and technical specialists, growing significantly faster than the U.S. average for the other occupations. 


• | High credit quality of physician tenants. In recent years, MOB tenants have increasingly consisted of larger hospital and physician groups. These groups utilize their size and expertise to obtain high rates of reimbursement and share overhead operating expenses which creates significant rent coverage, or an ability to pay rent. We believe these larger groups are generally credit-worthy and provide stability and long-term value for MOBs. 


• | Construction of new MOBs relative to the overall MOB supply continues to be constrained, with new market participants experiencing significant costly barriers to entry in markets in which we invest.


• | Creating strong demand for our MOBs. In addition, new development is primarily focused on off campus locations and in markets with growing populations.

PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of approximately 23.2 million square feet of GLA, with a leased rate of 92.0% (includes leases which have been executed, but which have not yet commenced).
Our properties were primarily located on the campuses of, or aligned with, nationally and regionally recognized healthcare systems in the U.S. These properties include leading health systems, such as Baylor Scott & White Health, Highmark-Allegheny Health Network, Hospital Corporation of America, Tenet Healthcare System and Community Health Systems. The Company is the largest owner of on-campus or adjacent MOBs in the country, with approximately 15.8 million square feet of GLA, or 68%, of our portfolio located in these locations. The remaining 32% are located in core community outpatient locations where healthcare is increasingly being delivered.

COMPETITION
We compete with many other real estate investment entities, including financial institutions, pension funds, real estate developers, other REITs, other public real estate companies, and private real estate investors for the acquisition of MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry. During the acquisition process, we compete with others who may have a competitive advantage over us at this time in terms of size, capitalization, local knowledge of the marketplace and extended contacts throughout the region. Any combination of these factors may result in an increased purchase price for properties or other real estate related assets of interest to us, which may reduce the number of opportunities available to us that meet our investment criteria. If the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria are limited, our ability to increase stockholder value may be adversely impacted.
We face competition in leasing available MOBs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry to prospective tenants. As a result, we may have to provide rent concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements, offer other inducements, or we may be unable to timely lease vacant space in our properties, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchase opportunities.
We believe our focus on MOBs, our experience and expertise, and our ongoing relationships with healthcare providers provide us with a competitive advantage. We have established an asset identification and acquisition network with healthcare providers and local developers which provides for the early identification of and access to acquisition opportunities. In addition, we believe this broad network allows us to effectively lease available space, retain our tenants, and maintain and improve our assets.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
Healthcare-Related Regulations
Overview.  The healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our tenants generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, fraud and abuse, relationships with physicians and other referral sources, and reimbursement. Changes in these laws and regulations could negatively affect the ability of our tenants to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making lease payments to us.
Healthcare Legislation.  In March 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The Affordable Care Act, along with other healthcare reform efforts, has resulted in comprehensive healthcare reform in the U.S. The laws are intended to reduce the number of individuals in the U.S. without health insurance and significantly change the means by which healthcare is organized, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act expanded reporting requirements and responsibilities related to facility ownership and management, patient safety, quality of care, and certain financial transactions, including payments by the pharmaceutical and medical industry to doctors and teaching hospitals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, our tenants may be regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. If they do not comply with the additional reporting requirements and responsibilities, our tenants’ ability to participate in federal healthcare programs may be adversely affected. Moreover, there may be other aspects of the comprehensive healthcare reform legislation for which regulations have not yet been adopted, which, depending on how they are implemented, could adversely affect our tenants and their ability to meet their lease obligations to us.
The Affordable Care Act has faced numerous judicial, legislative and executive challenges. Although there continue to be judicial challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court has thus far upheld the Affordable Care Act, including, most recently, in their June 25, 2015 ruling on King v. Burwell. However, President Trump and Congressional Republicans promised they would seek the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, newly-sworn-in President Trump issued an executive order aimed at seeking the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and directed the heads of all executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic and regulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. In addition, there have been and continue to be numerous Congressional attempts to amend and repeal the Affordable Care Act. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the TCJA, which amends certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act including the elimination of the individual insurance mandate. We cannot predict whether any future attempts to amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act will be successful. The future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain and any changes to existing laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act’s repeal, modification or replacement, could have a long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare. Both our tenants and us may be adversely affected by the law or its repeal, modification or replacement.
Reimbursement Programs.  Sources of revenue for our tenants may include the federal Medicare program, TRICARE, state Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider arrangements and self-insured employers, among others. Medicare, TRICARE and Medicaid programs, as well as numerous private insurance and managed care plans, generally require participating providers to accept government-determined reimbursement levels as payment in full for services rendered, without regard to facility charges. Changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could result in a substantial reduction in our tenants’ revenues.
In previous years, Medicare’s physician fee-for-service reimbursements were subject to a significant, automatic reduction in rates. Congress repeatedly enacted temporary legislation postponing the implementation of these physician rate cuts. In April 2015, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted rules that establishes physician reimbursement rates that allow for steady increases in rates over the near future. 
Despite this “doc-fix” legislation, we cannot predict whether future Congressional proposals will seek to reduce physician reimbursements. Efforts by other such payors to reduce healthcare costs will likely continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants. Further, revenue realizable under third-party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post-payment audits. Payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable, because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary. 
14

Amendments to or repeal of the Affordable Care Act and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. While the federal government agreed to pay the Medicaid expansion costs for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016, the federal government’s portion began declining in 2017. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court held in 2012 that states could not be required to expand their Medicaid programs, which has resulted in some states deciding not to expand their Medicaid programs. More recently, the Trump administration has enacted, or is considering enacting, measures designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures. In some other cases, states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Efforts to reduce costs will likely continue, which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our tenants. In addition, the failure of any of our tenants to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their ability to continue participating in Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid and other government sponsored payment programs. The financial impact on our tenants’ failure to comply with such laws and regulations could restrict their ability to make rent payments to us.
Various laws and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) initiatives and rules may also reduce or change medical provider compensation and reimbursement. 
These new laws, initiatives and CMS rules reflect an ongoing effort to reduce healthcare costs and reimburse medical providers based on criteria other than fee-for-service. Although their impact is difficult to predict, these laws, initiatives and CMS rules may adversely impact medical providers’ reimbursement and our tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws.  There are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from, or are in a position to make referrals in connection with, government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act includes program integrity provisions that both create new authorities and expand existing authorities for federal and state governments to address fraud, waste and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our lease arrangements with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. These laws include, among others:

• | the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral or recommendation for the ordering of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid;


• | the Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law,” which: (1) requires hospital landlords of facilities with financial relationships to charge a fair market value rent that does not take into account the volume or value of referrals and subject to specific exceptions; and (2) restricts physicians from making referrals for specifically designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare and Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a financial relationship;


• | the False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, including claims paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


• | the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to impose monetary penalties for certain fraudulent acts and regulatory violations and to exclude violators from participating in federal healthcare programs;


• | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which protects the privacy and security of personal health information; and


• | State laws which prohibit kickbacks, self-referrals and false claims, and are generally applicable to commercial and state payors.

In the ordinary course of their business, our tenants may be subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee applicable laws and regulations. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased, due in large part to amendments to the civil False Claims Act that were designed to encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits, known as qui tam suits, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former employees or patients. In addition to the False Claims Act, there may be civil litigation between private parties which seek damages for violations of federal and state laws. These types of actions may result in monetary penalties, punitive sanctions, damage assessments, imprisonment, increased governmental oversight, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Investigation by a federal or state governmental body for violation of fraud and abuse laws, imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants, and civil litigation could jeopardize that tenant’s ability to operate or to make rent payments to us.
15

Healthcare Licensure and Certification.  Some of our medical properties and our tenants may require a license, multiple licenses, a certificate of need (“CON”), or other certification to operate. Failure to obtain a license, CON, other certification, or loss of a required license, CON, or some other certification would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the tenant. This event could adversely affect our tenants’ ability to make rent payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate plant expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and the construction of healthcare-related facilities, by requiring a CON or other similar approval. State CON laws are not uniform throughout the U.S. and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of state CON laws on our facilities or the operations of our tenants.
Real Estate Ownership-Related Regulations
Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. For example:
Costs of Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “ADA”), all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with present requirements of the ADA, none of our properties have been audited and we have only conducted investigations of a limited number of our properties to determine compliance. We may incur additional costs in connection with compliance with the ADA. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. We may incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other legislation.
Costs of Government Environmental Regulation and Private Litigation.  Environmental laws and regulations hold us liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which may be on our properties. These laws could impose liability on us without regard to whether we caused the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may cause substantial costs and the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs. Various laws also impose liability on persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and such persons oftentimes must incur the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. As the owner and operator of our properties, we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances.
Use of Hazardous Substances by Some of Our Tenants.  Some of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes on our properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. Our leases require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. We are unaware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties.
Other Federal, State and Local Regulations.  Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these various requirements, we may incur governmental fines or private damage awards. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. We believe, based in part on engineering reports which are generally obtained by us at the time we acquire the properties, that all of our properties comply in all material respects with current regulations. However, if we were required to make significant expenditures under applicable regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 282 employees, of which less than 1% are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
TAX MATTERS
We filed an election with our 2007 federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We believe we have satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for all tax years starting in 2007 and we intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, we are generally not subject to federal and certain state income tax on net income that we currently distribute to stockholders. We expect to continue to make distributions sufficient to avoid income tax. 
16

While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet, through our annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, corporate level income tax would apply to our taxable income at the current corporate tax rates. As a result, the amount available for distributions to stockholders would be reduced and we would no longer be required to make distributions. Failure to qualify as a REIT could also adversely affect our ability to make investments and raise capital.
Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.
