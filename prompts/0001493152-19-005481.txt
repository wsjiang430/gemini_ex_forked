Company Overview
 
Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (“Resort Clubs”). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (“Galliano”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (“pH Environmental”).
 
On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.
 
The Company currently operates out of Orlando, Florida. In July 2012, the Company’s focus turned to acquiring patents that would protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies, such as low dose naltrexone (“LDN”) and Methionine [Met5]-enkephalin (“MENK”). The Company’s therapies are believed to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in such a way that they provide the potential to treat a variety of diseases. We believe our therapies may be able to correct abnormalities or deficiencies in the immune system in diseases such as HIV infection, autoimmune disease, immune disorders, or cancer; all of which can lead to disease progression and life-threatening situations when the immune system is not functioning optimally.
 
In October 2012, the Company formed TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a BVI company in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, which was set up to allow the Company to market and sell LDN in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have been able to obtain approval to sell the Company’s products.
 
In August 2013, the Company formed its United Kingdom subsidiary, TNI BioTech, LTD (the “UK Subsidiary”). The UK Subsidiary received approval to be considered a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) on August 21, 2013. The designation provides the UK Subsidiary with significant discounts when holding meetings or submitting filings to the EMA. On September 19, 2013, the UK Subsidiary submitted a pre-submission package to the EMA regarding Crohn’s Disease. The EMA granted the UK Subsidiary a meeting that took place on September 27, 2013. The UK Subsidiary is eligible to benefit from the provisions for administrative and financial assistance for SMEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 2049/2005. The Company will apply to obtain EMA benefits once funding becomes available.
 
In December 2013, the Company formed a subsidiary, Cytocom Inc. (“Cytocom”), to focus on conducting LDN and MENK clinical trials in the United States. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom to its shareholders. As part of the transaction (“Original Agreement”), the Company transferred to Cytocom certain of its rights, title and interest in or relating to intellectual property (i) patents, patent applications, and all divisional, continuations and continuations-in-part thereof, together with all reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such divisionals, continuations and continuations-in-part, reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions, and all utility models and statutory invention registrations and any other such analogous rights, (ii) trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, trade dress, trade styles, logos, trade names, services names, brand names, corporate names, assumed business names and general intangibles and other source identifiers of a like nature, together with the goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, and all registrations and applications for registrations thereof, together with all renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals and extensions, (iii) copyrights, mask work rights, database and design rights, moral rights and rights in Internet websites, whether registered or unregistered and whether published or unpublished, all registrations and recordings thereof and all applications in connection therewith, together with all renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions, and (iv) confidential and proprietary information, including, trade secrets and know-how.

The Original Agreement also granted the Company rights to market Lodonal™ and Met-Enkephalin (“MENK”) in “Emerging Markets,” which included all countries excluding Canada, Italy, Japan, France, Germany, United Kingdom, European Community and the United States. Pursuant to the Original Agreement, the Company was required to pay Cytocom a 5% royalty on all sales all ongoing drug development and fees due in connection with the underlying patents until such time as Cytocom was funded.
 
On December 8, 2014, the number of Cytocom shares of common stock that were issued to our shareholders totaled 113,242,522 shares. In connection with the Original Agreement, Cytocom issued an additional 140,100,000 shares of its common stock to the Company, which gave the Company a 55.3% stake in Cytocom on that date. In April 2016, the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Cytocom approved a reverse stock split of Cytocom’s outstanding common stock with one new share of stock for each twenty old shares of common stock. Cytocom effectuated and finalized the reverse split in June 2016.
 
On May 1, 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement (the “Restated Agreement”) with Cytocom. The Restated Agreement restates the licensing arrangement between the Company and Cytocom as provided by the Original Agreement. The Restated Agreement grants the Company distribution and marketing rights for Lodonal™ and MENK for humans in Emerging Markets. In addition, the Company has been granted the rights to distribute and market Lodonal™ and MENK for animal use in the United States. The royalty due to Cytocom has been reduced from 5% to 1% of sales and the Company no longer has any ongoing obligations to pay for costs in connection with the assets of Cytocom.
 
On June 4, 2018, the Company and Cytocom entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Agreement. Pursuant to the Stock Agreement, the Company cancelled approximately $4,000,000 of debt owed to it by Cytocom in exchange for ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding common stock of Cytocom, as calculated on a fully diluted basis. The Restated Agreement was a condition of the Stock Agreement.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company’s equity interest in Cytocom stood at 15.5% of Cytocom’s common stock issued and outstanding on that date. The Company’s policies with respect to accounting for its equity interest in Cytocom is described in Note 2 to the “Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” below (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Non-Controlling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries”).
 
In March 2014, the Company incorporated Airmed Biopharma Limited, an Irish corporation with an address in Dublin, Ireland, and Airmed Holdings Limited, an Irish company domiciled in Bermuda. The Irish companies were set up to benefit from incentives granted by the Irish government for the establishment of pharmaceutical companies (many of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies have located in Ireland), and so that the Company could take advantage of Ireland’s status as a member of the European Union and the European Economic Area. An Irish limited liability company enjoys a low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the world. The Irish-domiciled company hopes to qualify for tax incentives for Irish holding/headquartered companies and to benefit from the network of double tax treaties that reduce withholding taxes. TNI BioTech International, Ltd. will manage our international distribution, using product that is manufactured in Ireland and elsewhere.
 
At present, the Company is a late development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the licensing, development and commercialization of innovative prescription medications for humans in Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean and China (hereinafter referred to as “Emerging Markets”) and worldwide for animals and companion pet therapeutics. The Company is not permitted to market its licensed products in the United States.
 
Some of the Company’s more substantial risks include, but are not limited to, its lack of operating history, its high needs for capital, strict government regulation, risk of law suits from trial participants and otherwise, requirement for drug approvals which may never occur, changes in the industry, failure of the Company’s products to make it through trials, reliance on third parties to conduct trials and manufacture and distribute the Company’s drugs, and fierce competition. All of these factors and more could affect investors’ investments in the Company.

Current Business Strategy
 
We are currently focused on developing safe and effective treatments for immune-deficiency related diseases for humans in Emerging Markets, and for companion animals, primarily dogs, cats, pigs and horses worldwide. We seek to identify drugs for indications already demonstrated safe and effective in humans in order to develop therapeutics, based on these drugs, for similar indications in companion animals. We believe our development approach enables us to reduce risks associated with obtaining regulatory approval for unproven product candidates while shortening development times to bring our product candidates to market.
 
We have an active in-licensing effort focused on identifying human therapeutics for development and commercialization as pet therapeutics. We are seeking to identify compounds that have demonstrated safety and effectiveness in at least two species and are in, or have completed, Phase I or Phase II clinical trials in humans, with well-developed active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), process chemistry and a well-defined manufacturing process. We are also seeking to obtain exclusive, worldwide rights to these compounds in the animal health field and believe that we can bring the products to market for pets quickly and efficiently. We believe that our product candidates, if approved, will enable veterinarians to deliver a higher level of medical care to pets while providing an important revenue stream to the veterinarian’s practice.
 
The Company’s licensed technology platform is based on two interrelated cytokine drug therapies—Lodonal™ (low dose Naltrexone (“LDN”)) and Methionine Enkephalin (“MENK”)—which work by triggering a number of receptors, such as opioid and T Cell receptors on immune cells and activate or balance various cells of the immune system. Lodonal™ is a novel, immunodulator agent which has a basic normalizing effect locally on the gut, and activating and rebalancing the immune system this mechanism of action has the potential to benefit multiple disorders. Lodonal™ is in development for multiple possible follow-on indications, including cancer therapy-related toxic side effects to increase safety and improve efficacy. Our therapies also trigger the tolling receptors to shift Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti- inflammatory), which is critical when dealing with autoimmune and inflammatory disease in both humans and animals. Lodonal™ is approved in the Republic of Nigeria as an immune system regulator in the management of HIV patients. The Republic of Malawi has approved Lodonal™ as an adjunct treatment in cancer patients, and in the Dominican Republic Lodonal™ has been approved in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, Fibromyalgia, Crohn’s Disease, Inflammatory Disease, cancer and adjunct to standard of care in the treatment of cancer.
 
There is need for immune-modulatory therapies that act via a mechanism distinct from the current therapies and hence offer an alternate treatment option to patients non-responsive to standard of care, while also providing an option to patients responsive to standard of care but with unacceptable levels of adverse effects. Both drug candidates have more than 15 years of clinical trials in the treatment of various diseases based on published reports in peer-reviewed journals.
 
The Company has licensed four drug product candidates in early development and has identified several other potential product candidates for further investigation for companion pets and pigs. We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics and diagnostics segments of the animal health industry are likely to grow substantially as new treatments and diagnostic processes are identified, developed and marketed specifically for companion animals.
 
We are also investigating the development of alternative drug delivery systems for our drug product candidates. Many of the human therapeutics used in companion animals are only available in pill or injectable form. However, it can be difficult to give a companion animal a shot or to assure that the animal has swallowed a pill. As a result, we believe that compliance with treatment regimens is a significant problem for veterinarians and pet owners. The challenges associated with medicating pets are unique, and we believe that developing product candidates that can be easily taken by the pet or that can be easily administered by pet owners will help increase compliance. We also believe that developing new drug delivery technologies will enable us to produce drug products that can command a premium price, as well as potentially expand the life cycle of existing products.

During the past year, the Company has added new members to both its Board of Directors as well its Scientific Advisory Board to guide it in the sale of follow-on indications currently planned for Lodonal. The Scientific Advisory Board will focus primarily on physician education, and community and global awareness regarding the importance and availability of solutions for neglected comorbidities, such as the first-in-class immunodulator for Lodonal for its currently approved indication in Emerging Markets. The Company has developed relationships with more than 20 physicians, pharmacists and patient advocates around the world who are recognized specialists and key opinion leaders in the planned Lodonal follow-on indications, and is seeking their membership on the Scientific Advisory Board. As announced on August 7, 2018, Dr. Roscoe Moore Jr, a nationally-recognized medical Epidemiologist and veterinarian, joined Company as both a director and a member of the Scientific Advisory Board. In addition to Dr. Moore Jr., we added Dr. Gary Blick, a leading Key Opinion Leader and HIV advocate, to the Scientific Advisory Board.
 
Therapeutics Industry for Humans
 
The Company is focused on its lead therapies designed for the treatment in Emerging Markets of cancer, HIV/AIDS, Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia and Multiple Sclerosis. Management believes the pharmaceutical industry is eager to acquire advanced clinical-phase and approved products. However, despite the strong demand for advanced clinical-phase products worldwide, nearly 4,000 known compounds have had their development suspended in Phase II or earlier. Many of these are promising therapeutic drug candidates, but their development was discontinued because of strategic or financial constraints rather than for clinical reasons. Therefore, management believes there are clear market opportunities with a significant amount of unmet needs and a robust potential for partnering activities.
 
As described more fully above, Cytocom has granted the Company distribution and marketing rights for Lodonal™ and MENK for humans in Emerging Markets.
 
Lodonal™
 
Naltrexone hydrochloride (Naltrexone) is an oral opioid receptor antagonist that was initially approved by the United States (US) Food & Drug Administration (FDA) in 1984 (NDA 018932) for opiate addiction and in 1994 for alcohol dependency. Naltrexone has also been approved in Europe since at least 1989 for the treatment of opiate addiction and more recently alcohol dependency. The standard regimen for these conditions is one 50 mg tablet per day. Multiple generic versions of naltrexone have been approved by FDA over the last three decades. FDA approval of all naltrexone products is for use in the management of opioid addiction and alcohol dependence.
 
At lower doses (approximately 1/10 for the approved dose [4.5 mg/day]), naltrexone has been reported to exhibit immune modulatory functions that have potential therapeutic benefits in the treatment of autoimmune and/or inflammatory conditions. Low dose naltrexone therapy has shown promise in placebo-controlled clinical trials for use in the treatment of diseases with compromised immune system such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer, Crohn’s disease and other inflammatory diseases. Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (Immune Therapeutics) has developed a Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) formulation, known as LDN and trade name Lodonal™ for use as an active immunotherapy drug containing 4.5 mg naltrexone. Lodonal™ is available as tablets, capsules, and liquid formulations for oral administration.
 
Lodonal™ acts primarily by blocking of the opiate receptors on immune cells for a short time period which results in a reactive increase in the production of opioid receptors on the cells, and an increase in circulating levels of beta-endorphins and enkephalins. Increased levels of beta- endorphin and enkephalins have been shown to stimulate the immune system, promoting an increase in the number and functions of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. The increase in the T-cell and NK cell numbers and functions, in turn, appears to restore a more normal balance of the immune cells such that effects of inflammatory diseases are significantly reduced. In controlled clinical trials, treatment with LDN led to up to 300% increases in the numbers of T- cells, both CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in patients with Crohn’s Disease, HIV/AIDS, Fibromyalgia, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), autism or cancer. In addition to the antagonist effect on μ-opioid receptors (opioid receptors with a high affinity for enkaphalins and beta-endorphin) and other opioid receptors, LDN also exhibited an antagonist effect on non- opioid receptors [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) or TLR-9 as well as the TLR-p receptors) that are found on macrophages such as microglia, which led to shift in Th1 to Th2 resulting in reduced inflammation.

Lodonal™ is believed to have other biological effects as well. The opioid growth factor (OGF), chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, is an endogenous opioid peptide that interacts with the OGF receptor (OGFr) which delays the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways. The OGF-OGFr axis is an inhibitory pathway that plays a role in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Studies have shown that the modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis can be accomplished by the use of low doses of naltrexone. By regulating the OGF-OGFr pathway with LDN, this can have an immune modulation and anti-inflammatory effect. Endogenous opioids (enkephalins and endorphins) and opioid receptors are found not only in the central nervous system but also on other cells including immune-mediating cells, and epithelial cells (including those in the gastrointestinal tract) where they play a role in regulation of inflammation, growth, and mucosal repair. Opioid receptors have been associated with most types of immune cells and chemokine receptors, where their interaction involves changes in cell proliferation, alteration of functions, and release of inflammatory cytokines. Due to its ability to block the opioid receptors on a variety of cells, LDN may have effects in a broad range of immune system disorders.
 
Extensive pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism data in humans at doses of 50 mg/day (Wall et al., 1981, Meyer at el., 1984) is available for naltrexone. Additionally, multiple single and repeat dose non-clinical studies have been conducted with naltrexone to evaluate its toxicity profile at a wide range of doses including doses lower than the marketed dose of 50mg/day. Naltrexone has a good safety profile at daily doses of up to 50-100 mg. Based on the available information, LDN is also considered to have a safe profile, accordingly, no additional major non-clinical toxicity studies are deemed necessary for market approval in the US and other regions of the World. The drug product for Lodonal™ does not include any new excipients.
 
The product may be manufactured as a tablet, capsule and a liquid formulation. All of the ingredients in Lodonal™ are used in similar formulations, and are used in amounts below the maximum daily limit established by FDA for the oral route of administration. The excipients are pregelatinized starch, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethy cellulose, crospovidone and stearic acid.
 
The opioid growth factor (OGF), chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin (MENK), is an endogenous opioid peptide that interacts with the OGF receptor (OGFr) which delays the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways. The OGF-OGFr axis is an inhibitory pathway that plays a role in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Studies have shown that the modulation of the OGF-OGFr axis can be accomplished by the use of low doses of naltrexone (Zagon et al., 2013-A, McLaughlin PJ et al., 2012-A). This effect is credited with the biological response seen with treatment of low dose naltrexone in multiple disease model studies.
 
Major studies have been conducted with low doses of naltrexone into the treatment of HIV/AIDS, Cancer and Crohn’s Disease. Other studies have been conducted for the treatment of fibromyalgia, chronic pain, Haley-Haley Disease, hypothyroidism, and Lichen Planopilaris.
 
HIV/AIDS
 
In an in vitro setting, activated CD4+ lymphocytes were infected with a HIV-1 isolate. Naltrexone was used at a concentration of 10−12–10−10 M in cell culture. At this dose, naltrexone did not affect HIV-1 expression; however, naltrexone was able to increase the antiviral activity of Azidothymidine (AZT) and indinavir 2- to 3-fold. The results of this in vitro study suggested that the use of LDN in HIV-1-infected patients is most likely to cause a synergistic activity with adjunctive therapy, specifically anti-viral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infection (Gekker G, et al., 2001).
Cancer
 
Significant nonclinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the potency of treatment with naltrexone in cancer disease models. The OGF-OGFr peptide and receptor have been detected in a wide variety of cancers, including thyroid cancer (e.g. follicular-derived thyroid cancers), ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer, Hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, neuroblastoma, and colon cancer (Zagon et al., 2013-A&B, McLaughlin PG et al., 2009, Meng J et al., 2013, Avella DM et al., 2010, McLaughlin et al., 2012-B, Zagon et al., 2000, Bisignani GJ et al., 1999, Zagon et al., 1996, McLaughlin et al., 1999). It has been shown in a number of animal studies that the OGF- OGFr axis can be directly targeted by the administration of LDN for treatment of a number of cancers. LDN has been shown to stimulate the production of OGF and OGFr for subsequent interaction following blockade of the receptor; thus having a direct impact on this biological pathway, stopping the cell cycle, and therefore having the ability to stop cancerous cell growth. Preclinical data from Zagon et al (2013-A) support the above findings and the use of LDN for the treatment of cancer.

It has also been demonstrated that immune cell activation and proliferation are sensitive to the effects of LDN. The use of LDN on both phenotypic and functional maturation of Bone Marrow- derived Dendritic Cells (BMDCs) was tested (Meng J et al., 2013). This study showed that LDN enhanced maturation of BMDCs by 1) up-regulating the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, CD40, CD83, CD80 and CD86 molecules; 2) down-regulating the rates of pinocytosis and phagocytosis; 3) mounting potential of BMDCs to drive T cell; and 4) inducing higher levels of Interleukin (IL)-12 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α). Based upon these data, it was concluded that LDN can efficiently promote the maturation of BMDCs suggesting LDN’s ability for enhancing host immunity, specifically in cancer therapy.
 
Female nude mice were transplanted intraperitoneally (i.p.) with SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells. These mice were then treated daily with OGF (10 mg/kg), LDN (0.1 mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of vehicle (saline, control arm). Tumor burden, as well as DNA synthesis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were assessed in tumor tissue after completion of 40 days of treatment. Low doses of naltrexone blocked the endogenous opioids from opioid receptors for about 4-6 hours post treatment. Both OGF and LDN markedly reduced ovarian tumor burden by a decrease in tumor nodule numbers and tumor weight (Donahue RN et al., 2011-A).
 
In another study, nude mice were transplanted with BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells and then were administered 5 mg/kg of OGF three times daily. The treated mice exhibited a marked retardation in tumorigenicity compared to animals injected with only sterile water (controls). OGF-treated animals had a delay of 43% in initial tumor appearance compared to control subjects at 10.6 days post inoculation. While all of the control mice had tumors, 62% of the mice in the OGF group had no signs of neoplasia. Tumor tissue excised from mice after 30 days was assayed for levels of OGF and zeta opioid receptors. Tumor tissue levels of OGF were 24-fold greater in OGF-treated mice than controls, but plasma levels of OGF were 8.6-fold lower in animals receiving OGF (Zagon et al., 1997).
 
Zagon and team transplanted nude mice with HT-29 human colon cancer cells. On the same day, mice were administered OGF at dosages of 0.5, 5, or 25 mg/kg/day. More than 80% of the mice receiving OGF once daily beginning at the time of tumor cell transplantation did not exhibit neoplasia at 3 weeks post-transplantation, compared with a tumor incidence rate of 93% in control mice. At 7 weeks post-transplantation, 57% of the mice given OGF did not display a tumor. OGF delayed both tumor appearance and growth in animals developing colon cancer in a xenograft model (Zagon et al., 1996).
 
Mice with established ovarian tumors were treated with LDN and cisplatin. The combination treatment resulted in an additive inhibitory effect on tumorigenesis. LDN alleviated the toxicity associated with cisplatin (e.g. weight loss). LDN had also upregulated the expression of OGF and OGFr, showing its benefits as a stand-alone or combination therapy in the treatment of cancer (Donahue et al., 2011-B). These animal studies support the use of LDN as a non-toxic therapy for the treatment of ovarian, pancreatic, colon and other forms of cancers.
 
Crohn’s Disease
 
Crohn’s disease is another indication where significant non-clinical and clinical research has been conducted using LDN. The non-clinical studies are described below, while the clinical studies in Crohn’s disease are described in the following sections. All the studies point towards promising results in Crohn’s disease with LDN
 
A study in mice was conducted to determine if low dose naltrexone could reduce inflammation of the bowel in a chemically-induced mouse model of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). To establish the model, C57BL/6J mice were given either untreated drinking water or water containing 2% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in two parallel regimens to establish moderate and severe colitis. After colitis was established, animals with moderate colitis were administered either saline (control) or naltrexone (8 µg/kg or 400 µg/kg) daily, while those with severe colitis received 0.1 or 10 mg/kg of naltrexone. DSS-treated animals had significant weight loss (p = 0.006) and higher disease activity index (DAI) scores (p < 0.001) compared to water controls. Mice that had moderate colitis and were administered naltrexone at doses of 8 µg/kg or 400µg/kg exhibited less weight loss, lower DAI scores, and less histologic evidence of inflammation compared to positive controls (DSS + saline). Mice with severe colitis did not significantly respond to treatment with naltrexone at either dose (Matters et al., 2008).
 

10 | P a g e
------------


In addition to monitoring weight loss, DAI score, and histology, the expression of several genes of interest, including cytokines and downstream mediators, was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of Interleukin 5 (IL-5), IL-6, IL-12, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT4 were assessed. IL-5 levels were not significantly changed treated and control mice populations. The levels of mRNA encoding the cytokines IL-6 and IL-12, known to be up-regulated in IBD, were reduced in naltrexone treated mice compared to the untreated controls to almost normal levels. There was no effect on the mRNA levels for cytokine signaling intermediate STAT3 but that for STAT4 were improved in the naltrexone-treated mice. There was no significant effect on the levels of inflammatory cytokine markers (Matters et al., 2008).
 
Other Diseases
 
Although LDN has been evaluated in several additional indications in clinical trials including fibromyalgia, chronic pain, Haley-Haley Disease, hypothyroidism, Lichen Planopilaris, and autoimmune diseases, there are few non-clinical studies in these indications.
 
The long term effects of OGF and LDN on expression of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were examined in a C57BL/6 mouse model. The mice were administered daily injections of 10 mg/kg OGF, 0.1 mg/kg LDN or saline at the time of EAE induction. This treatment regimen continued for 60 days. One hundred percent (100%) of the saline control group had behavioral symptoms of EAE, in comparison to 63% and 68% of the OGF and LDN mice, respectively. Both severity and disease indices of the OGF- and LDN-treated mice were notably decreased from saline control cohorts. By the end of the study (day 60), 6- and 3-fold more animals in the OGF and LDN treated groups, respectively, had remission compared to the saline control mice. The results of this study indicate that treatment with OGF or LDN has no long-term repercussions and did not exacerbate EAE, but rather halted progression of the disease, reversed neurological deficits, and prevented the onset of neurological dysfunction (Rahn KA et al., 2011).

The Company has an application pending approval to sell LodonalTM in Kenya.
 
To further its business strategy in these and other countries in Emerging Markets, the Company has entered into relationships with a number of groups to promote the sale of its products, focusing initially on countries in Africa and the Caribbean.
 
Since the Company received approval from the National Agency for Food & Drug Administration & Control of Nigeria (“NAFDAC”) to sell LodonalTM in Nigeria, the Company has reached agreements with distributors to sell the product in Nigeria and some surrounding countries. In October 2013, the Company announced the signing of a Distribution Agreement with AHAR Pharma, a Nigerian company, to market Lodonal™, in Nigeria for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Due to the fact that AHAR Pharma failed to meet its contractual purchase obligations, in April 2018, AHAR Pharma transferred its rights under the distribution agreement to Fidson Healthcare Plc (“Fidson”), and Fidson signed an exclusive distribution agreement with the Company to distribute Lodonal™. In October 2018, the Company shipped 250,000 pills to Fidson to support the product launch in the coming months.
 
On August 22, 2017, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with TNI BioTech International Ltd. (“TNI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and Omaera Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Omaera”). Pursuant to the Agreement, Omaera will be the sole distributor of the Company’s Products, as listed in Section 2 of the Agreement, for sale in Kenya. The Products to be distributed by Omaera will be manufactured by Acromax Dominicana, SA (“Acromax”) in the Dominican Republic. The term of the Agreement began on August 22, 2017 and is to continue for a period of three (3) years, unless earlier terminated.

On October 18, 2012, the Company and Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Qianjiang Pharmaceutical”), signed a Venture Cooperation Agreement on New Drug Methionine Enkephalin (the “Venture Agreement”) pursuant to which Qianjiang Pharmaceutical acquired an exclusive license for the production of MENK in China. The Venture Agreement requires that Qianjiang Pharmaceutical conduct drug research and pilot testing for MENK, organize pre-clinical studies, and apply for clinical trials for MENK with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. The Venture Agreement was amended on February 24, 2013 to expand the clinical trials from pancreatic to both pancreatic and liver cancer and amended on March 6, 2014 to require Qianjiang Pharmaceutical to commence studies and clinical trials in China and place funds in the co-administration account.
 

15 | P a g e
------------


On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Supplementary Agreement on New Drug Methionine – Enkephalin Cooperation (the “Amendment”) with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical, amending the Venture Agreement, as amended. The Company and Qianjiang Pharmaceutical executed the Amendment to accelerate clinical trials in both the United States and China, and agreed to immediately initiate three month Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) Toxicology Studies (rat and dog) within 30 days of signing the Amendment. The Amendment requires that the GLP Toxicology Studies Trials are conducted in China in accordance with international standards and standards acceptable to the FDA.
 
China
 
In February 2013, the Company signed a Strategic Framework Agreement for Cooperation with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical. Under the agreement, the parties will work together to further the development of new products and conduct research and development on the Company’s licensed patented technology. Specifically, the parties aim to co-invest to develop and market products focusing on HIV, cancer and related autoimmune system therapies, develop co-ventured manufacturing facilities in China, and develop co-ventured distribution of the developed products in China and Africa. The agreement does not have a definitive term, as each new agreement resulting from the cooperation will set forth the material terms, including, but not limited to, fees, duration and termination therein.
 
In December of 2016 Qianjiang Pharmaceutical delivered various documents under the agreements related to its studies of Exploratory Toxicology (nGLP) and Definitive Toxicology (GLP). In addition to the pharmacology and toxicology studies, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical and China Peptide completed the formulation and CMC necessary to scale up manufacturing of MENK.
 
There has been no progress under the agreements in the past 12 months, since a change of ownership of Qianjiang Pharmaceutical in 2017. The Company continues to hold discussions with new management about the future of the agreements.
 
Pet Therapeutics Industry 
 
According to the American Pet Products Association (“APPA”), U.S. consumers spent $69.51 billion dollars on pet products in 2017 and are estimated to spend 72.13 in 2018. Cats and dogs are the most popular pet species in the United States and Europe: there are approximately 96 million cats and 83 million dogs in the United States and 85 million cats and 74 million dogs in Europe. (https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp. An estimated 68% of U.S. households have at least one pet. The U.S. pet market has grown by rates far exceeding inflation, driven by increases in average spending per pet each year since 2006. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (https://www.avma.org), the U.S. veterinary care segment has been among the fastest growing segments of the overall U.S. pet market. Spending on veterinary care in 2017 was $17.07 billion, and we expect it to be $18.26 billion for 2018, representing a CAGR of 6.7%.


Transparency Market Research expects the global veterinary therapeutics market will expand at a CAGR of 6.7% over the period between 2016 and 2024. As a result, the market, which held an opportunity of US$26.9bn in 2015, is expected to rise to US$50.2bn by 2024. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veterinary-therapeutics-market-is-expected-to-rise-to-us502-billion-by-2024-increasing-pet-ownership-to-boost-demand-for-veterinary-therapeutics-across-the-globe-transparency-market-research-592439511.html
 
There have been relatively few approvals granted by the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in recent years despite a generally faster, less expensive and more predictable regulatory approval process for pet therapeutics than human therapeutics. For example, in 2017, 46 new human drugs were approved by the FDA, while only 12 new drugs were approved by the CVM, 6 of which were for use in cats or dogs and 2 of those were for heartworms and one was a supplement. We believe that the pet market, driven in part by expansion of the veterinary care segment, will continue to grow and that the introduction of novel pet therapeutics offering significant safety and efficacy benefits over existing products will result in pet therapeutics garnering a larger share of total consumer spending on pets.

Differences between human and pet therapeutics 
 
While the business of developing and commercializing therapeutics for pets shares a number of characteristics with the business of developing and commercializing therapeutics for humans, there are also significant differences between the pet therapeutics and human therapeutics businesses that we believe make the pet therapeutics market attractive, including faster, less expensive and more predictable development.
 
Development of pet therapeutics is generally faster and less expensive than for human therapeutics because it requires fewer clinical studies, involves fewer subjects and is conducted directly in the target species. Because there is no need to bridge from pre-clinical investigations in one species to the final target species, decisions on the potential efficacy and safety of products often can be made more quickly, and the likelihood of success often can be established earlier. This contributes to the enhanced process and greater capital efficiency of pet versus human drug development.
 
Role and economics of veterinary practices 
 
In addition to the primary goal of improving the health of pets, veterinary practices can generate additional value and revenue growth by prescribing pet therapeutics. Unlike in the human pharmaceutical market, veterinarians often serve the dual roles of doctor and pharmacist, as pet owners typically purchase medicines directly from veterinarians. As a result, the sale of pet therapeutics directly to pet owners is a meaningful contributor to veterinary practice economics. According to industry sources, approximately one-third of companion animal practice revenue comes from prescription drug sales, parasiticides, vaccinations and non-prescription medicines. We believe that this revenue stream could be increased significantly with the introduction of novel therapeutics that have been specifically developed for pets.
 
Partnership relationships with, and better access to, veterinarian decision-makers 
 
The pet therapeutics industry typically uses a combination of sales representatives to inform veterinarians about the attributes of products and technical and veterinary operations specialists to provide advice regarding local, regional and global trends. In many cases, a pet therapeutics sales representative is viewed by the veterinarian as both an educator and a business partner. These direct relationships allow pet therapeutics sales representatives to understand the needs of the veterinarians and ultimately pet owners and to develop products to better meet those needs.
 
Primarily private-pay nature of veterinary market 
 
Pet owners generally pay for pet healthcare out-of-pocket, including pet therapeutics. Third-party insurance covers less than 5% of U.S. pet owners. Pet owners make decisions primarily on the advice of their veterinarian, without the influence of insurance companies or government payors that are often involved in product and pricing decisions in human healthcare. We believe that this dynamic results in less pricing pressure than in human health. Furthermore, this enables pet therapeutics companies to directly market to pet owners to encourage them to consult with their veterinarians.
 
Lack of robust generic competition and strong brand loyalty 
 
There is no large, well-capitalized industry principally focused on generic pet therapeutics. Reasons for this include the smaller average market size of each product opportunity, the importance of direct sales distribution and education to veterinarians and the primarily private-pay nature of the business. We believe that this dynamic also results in less pricing pressure than in human health.

Product candidates for pet therapies
 
We believe, based on the existing clinical data from our human trials in pain, cancer and inflammatory diseases, we will be able to fast-track development for companion pets. Our mission is to use our immunotherapies and apply them to veterinary medicine. By advancing our immunotherapies for animals, we expect to make Immune Therapeutics a leading animal immunotherapy healthcare companies.
 
The Company is considering an extensive pipeline of novel therapeutics for pets that are safer and less toxic than existing therapies. We are focusing efforts in the areas of pain, inappetence, cancer, viral diseases, allergy and other conditions. Our core strategy is to modify, improve, and repurpose pre-existing drugs and therapeutics that have already proven to be safe and effective in humans.
 
By using this strategy, the Company expects to exceed the typical 5% success rate seen with new chemical entities in traditional drug development. We believe, by repurposing, we can develop therapeutics for an average of $3 to $5 million per indication in less than two years. The market for veterinary medicine may only be a fraction of the size of the human market, but development costs of veterinary drugs is considerably cheaper.
 
Product Candidates
 
The Company currently has two licensed compounds in development for six product approvals in cats and dogs in each of the United States and Europe. The following table identifies each of the compounds in development, its potential indication, development status and expected next step in the development process. Cytocom has three INDs for Crohn’s Disease, HIV and Cancer. We will be using the briefing package submitted to the FDA in March 2018 to justify the granting of our INDs, MUMS and conditional approval for pets.
 
We believe, based on the existing clinical data from our human trials in pain, cancer and inflammatory diseases, we will be able to fast-track development for companion pets. Our mission is to use our licensed immunotherapies and apply them to veterinary medicine. By advancing our immunotherapies for animals this would make the Company one of the first animal immunotherapy healthcare companies.
 
Our dedication to our immunotherapies has led us to focus on an extensive pipeline of novel therapeutics for pets that are safer and less toxic then existing therapies. We plan to concentrate on the areas of pain, inappetence, cancer, viral diseases, allergy and other conditions. Our core strategy is to modify, improve, and repurpose pre-existing drugs and therapeutics that have already proven to be safe and effective in humans.
 
By using this strategy, the Company expects to avoid the typical 5% success rate seen with new chemical entities in traditional drug development; our goal is to achieve 70% success rate. We believe, by repurposing, we can develop our therapeutics for an average of $3 to $5 million per indication in less than two years. The market for veterinary medicine may only be a fraction of the size of the human market, but development costs of veterinary drugs can be significantly cheaper.
 
A review of the Company’s intellectual property portfolio, which includes our investigational therapies, illustrates where the Company has extensive clinical data for pain, viral disease, allergy and cancer treatments. The Company believes these data have the potential to improve the quality of lives in companion animals. The Company intends to use the clinical data to file for Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS) for treatments for pain, viral disease, allergy and cancer. If MUMS is approved for our therapies, we will submit them to the FDA for Conditional Approval. If we receive both MUMS and Conditional Approval, we would receive 7-year exclusivity under MUMS for the approved therapy, and Conditional Approval would allow for the sales and marketing of the drugs for up to five years while we complete our trials.
 
Indications
 

● | AIRT-101: Chemotherapy-induced emesis in dogs 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AIRT-102: For the treatment of unresectable stage III, IV or V mammary carcinoma in dogs 
● | MATI-101: For the treatment of lymphoma in dogs

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AIRT-104: Atopic dermatitis in dogs 
● | AIRT-105: feline herpes virus 

Lead Products Candidates
 
AIRT-101
 
Our first lead drug product candidate is AIRT-101. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in AIRT-101 is naltrexone, which has been the subject of multiple studies in humans and has been approved for use in humans for decades. AIRT-101 is designed to reduce chemotherapy-induced emesis in dogs in pill form. We expect to file for an Investigational New Animal Drug, or INAD, by the end of the second quarter of 2019. By that date, we also expect to file for MUMS for chemotherapy-induced emesis in dogs. If the Company is successful in obtaining this MUMS designation, we will seek conditional approval from the FDA to sell and market the product while completing our studies. We have completed our formulation and expect to finalize manufacturing for trials by the end of the second quarter of 2019.


AIRT-102
 
Our second lead drug product candidate is AIRT-102. It is designed for the treatment of unresectable stage III, IV or V mammary carcinoma in dogs. In the first half of 2019 we expect to file for an INAD and MUMS for the treatment of unresectable state III, IV or V mammary carcinoma in dogs using existing clinical data with AIT-102 in 150 female dogs with mammary carcinoma in dogs. Third-party trial results indicate that adjuvant treatment with AIRT-101 is statistically correlated to increased survival and improved quality of life.
 
MATI-101
 
Our third lead drug product candidate is MATI-101. We expect to file for an INAD and MUMS for the treatment of lymphoma in dogs by the end of 2019. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in MATI-101 is Met (5) Enkephalin, which has been the subject of multiple studies in humans but is not approved at this time by the FDA. We have completed our formulation and expect to finalize manufacturing for trials by the end of the second quarter of 2019. We will commence pilot testing of MATI-101 in the second half of 2019 to determine a primary endpoint disease progression and secondary endpoint reduction in side effects versus the standard of care. Certain lymphomas in dogs’ is one of the indications that qualifies for MUMS designation.
 
Pipeline of Potential Products
 
In addition to these drug product candidates, we have identified several other potential drug product candidates that we intend to study, subject to obtaining additional capital and validation of data. Our immune restoration approach represents a significant change from the systemic immunosuppression of existing therapies used today to treat inflammatory diseases, chronic pain and cancer. Current treatments carry warnings for patients for the increased risk of developing severe infections that may lead to hospitalization and/or death. Our current pipelines, as immunomodulators, assist in the restoration of the immune system through T-Cell activation. This will shift the paradigm and create a new generation of affordable drugs with transformative safety and efficacy.

● | The North America Pet Cancer Therapeutics Market accounted for more than 80% of the overall revenue share in 2016 and will continue to grow at healthy CAGR in coming years, led by regional presence of several established players and early product adoption. 
● | The market opportunity for animal oncology products is already significant as there are few products available for animal companions and the families who care for them. According to a study conducted by the Morris Animal Foundation, the primary concern of American pet owners today is companion animal cancer disease. An estimated 12 million dogs and cats are diagnosed with cancer in the US each year, and more than 80% die within two years of diagnosis due to unsatisfactory treatment options. The US market for chemotherapy used in companion animals is estimated at $300 million and is expected to grow with the introduction of specifically-designed veterinary chemotherapy products with favorable tolerability profiles. 

Competition for Pet Treatment
 
There is significant competition in the field of pet treatments, especially in the way of biologics and cancer therapies that are now approved. Major players in the global marketplace include Abbott Animal Health, Bayer HealthCare AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Ceva Santé Animale S.A., Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck Animal Health, Merial Limited, Novartis Animal Health, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Vetericyn, Inc., Vétoquinol SA, and Virbac SA, among others.
Minor Use and Minor Species for Animals
 
A sponsor can apply to the FDA for Designation status for MUMS drugs before their approval or conditional approval for use on animals. MUMS Designation is a status similar to “orphan drug” status for human medications. It makes the sponsor eligible for incentives to support the approval or conditional approval of the designated use. MUMS does not allow the drug to be marketed, sold promoted or advertised.
 
When a drug is designated for intended use, the sponsor of the drug obtains seven (7) years of exclusive marketing rights upon approval (or conditional approval) of the drug for that intended use. Each designation that is granted must be unique, i.e., only one designation can be issued for a particular drug substance in a specific form of dosage for specific intended use. The intended use includes both the target species and the disease or condition to be treated.
 
During the conditional approval period, a company can legally market the animal drug for the labeled indications while collecting the remaining Conditional Approval: A company can ask the FDA to renew the conditional approval annually for up to four more years, for a total of five years of conditional approval. A company must show ongoing progress toward proving “substantial evidence of effectiveness” to maintain conditional approval. After providing the necessary data, a company will than apply to FDA for full approval.

Unmet Needs
 
Unmet animal healthcare needs as mirrored by the scarcity of new drugs, diagnostic aids, treatment monitoring, and vaccines for preventing, detecting and treating infections, brings to fore the untapped potential in the animal medication market. Presently, there exists increased demand for new laboratory tests to monitor emerging diseases as well as an urgent requirement for developing vaccines for improving animal health. In addition to gaps in animal disease surveillance, current areas of unmet needs in veterinary care include the lack of drugs in the senior animal veterinary care market. For instance, cognitive dysfunction syndrome in aged dogs and cats is a relatively unmapped area of treatment with very few drugs in the marketplace. Veterinary oncology is another example of where there exists significant unmet need. Cancer in companion animals has received little attention till date. Another untapped area for drug development includes “Antidepressants” to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and separation anxiety in dogs. Also, the rising tendency among companion animals to be obese or overweight fuels the need for medications specifically targeted for diabetes, high blood pressure, and congestive heart failure. Current unmet, latent and evolving animal health care needs will continue to drive growth in the market in the upcoming years.
 
The US is the largest regional market for animal medication. https://www.farmprogress.com/management/animal-health-market-hit-43-billion-five-years. Asia-Pacific represents the fastest growing regional market, with annual dollar sales growing at a CAGR of approximately 10.5% over the analysis period. Steady increase in income, rising standards of living, rise in per capita consumption of animal protein products and subsequent increase in demand for healthy food-producing animals are primary factors driving growth in the Asia-Pacific animal medication market.
 
The market opportunity for animal oncology products is already significant as there are few products available for animal companions and the families who care for them. According to a study conducted by the Morris Animal Foundation, the primary concern of American pet owners today is companion animal cancer disease. An estimated 12 million dogs and cats are diagnosed with cancer in the US each year, and more than 80% die within two years of diagnosis due to unsatisfactory treatment options. The US market for chemotherapy used in companion animals is estimated at $500 million and is expected to grow with the introduction of specifically-designed veterinary chemotherapy products with favorable tolerability profiles.
 
Our Strategy for Animals
 
Our goal is to become a leading provider of therapeutics developed and approved specifically for the treatment of unmet medical needs in pets worldwide. We intend to be a pet-focused company, helping to shape and define the pet therapeutics market. We plan to accomplish this by:

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
The Company relies on third parties for raw materials for the clinical production of its products and product candidates for use in humans.
 
In the previous years, American Peptide Company has been the Company’s supplier of the API in MENK, and S.A.L.A.R.S SpA has supplied the API in LDN. The Company may seek additional sources of the API in the future.
Competition
 
The industry for treatment of humans is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, and price and reimbursement level.
 
Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
 
Lodonal™/LDN
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of Lodonal™, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency and route administration, convenience and price, the level of branded and generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
The markets for medicines to treat Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia, MS, HIV and other autoimmune diseases are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies. Pfizer (Lyrica), Eli Lilly (Cymbalta) and Forest Laboratories/Cyprus Biosciences (Savella) market FDA approved drugs for fibromyalgia. We are aware of several companies pursuing treatments for fibromyalgia, including Chelsea Therapeutics, Johnson and Johnson, Meda, Pfizer, Synthetic Biologics, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Theravance. Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the FDA’s website at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 
Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
We expect Lodonal™, if approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, to compete directly with Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc.’s Remicade (infliximab), UCB S.A.’s Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) and Abbott Laboratories’ Humira (adalimumab), each of which is currently approved for the treatment of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and several other products. Lodonal, if developed and approved for the treatment of MS, would compete with Biogen Idec’s Avonex (interferon beta-1a), Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals’ Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.’s Copaxone (Glatiramer Acetate) and several other products. New developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace.

The Company believes that LodonalTM will provide the first affordable, non-toxic approach for treatment of immune dysfunction, cancer and chronic inflammatory state in Emerging Markets. Competitive advantages and benefits of LodonalTM in Emerging Markets include:
 

● | Lower production costs and sales price of treatments. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | LodonalTM can be manufactured and delivered in Emerging Markets for under $.90 cents a day 
● | Lodonal™ should be able to substantially reduce health care costs for a number of reasons, including: 


● | Lodonal™ can provide a new, non-toxic inexpensive method of medical treatment by mobilizing the natural defenses of one’s own immune system. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It can be used as a stand-alone therapy or an adjunct to existing immunosuppressive therapies by reducing the toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. 
● | Lodonal™ does not require the medical supervision of antiretroviral or immunosuppressive therapies. 
● | Lodonal™ has not been found to have any no toxic side effects as it is an immunomodulator and activates and re-balances the immune system. 
● | Lodonal™ as an immunomodulator has a way of helping what is now referred to as “non-AIDS morbidity”, and, in the popular press, “premature aging”. 
● | Lodonal™ studies show it enhances maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs). 
● | Lodonal™ has been shown to be a safe as placebo in clinical trials between .03mg and 50mg. 
● | Lodonal™ studies show it does not compromise the immune system. 
● | Lodonal™ has been shown to reduce the number of opportunistic infections with HIV/AIDS. 


● | Lodonal™ may provide a new, non-toxic inexpensive method of medical treatment by mobilizing the natural defenses of one’s own immune system. It can be used as a stand-alone therapy or an adjunct to existing immunosuppressive therapies by reducing the toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lodonal™ may can improve compliance. When used correctly, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective. However, according to recent studies, ART regimens require 70–90% adherence in order to be effective. Sustaining adherence to ART over the long term requires accurate and consistent monitoring, and this is a particular challenge for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. 

MENK/MENK
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of MENK, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency and route administration, convenience and price, the level of branded and generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Each cancer indication for which we are developing products has a number of established therapies with which our candidates will compete. Most major pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs, including both therapies with traditional, as well as novel, mechanisms of action. Some of the anticipated competitor treatments for acute myelogenous leukemia include Genzyme Corporation’s Clolar (clofarabine), currently approved as a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Eisai Corporation’s Dacogen (decitabine), currently approved as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome, Celgene Corporation’s Vidaza (azacitidine), currently approved as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome, and Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Onrigin (laromustine) currently being developed as a treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia, any or all of which could change the treatment paradigm of acute leukemia. Each of these compounds is further along in clinical development than is MENK activated NK cell product.
