ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Adhera Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Marina Biotech, Inc.) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, MDRNA Research, Inc. (“MDRNA”), Cequent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Cequent”), Atossa Healthcare, Inc. (“Atossa”), and IThenaPharma, Inc. (“IThena”) (collectively “Adhera,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company that leverages innovative distribution models and technologies to improve the quality of care for patients in the United States suffering from chronic and acute diseases. We are focused on fixed dose combination (“FDC”) therapies in hypertension, with plans to expand the portfolio of drugs we commercialize to include other therapeutic areas.
 
Our mission is to provide effective and patient centric treatment for hypertension and resistant hypertension while actively seeking additional assets that can be commercialized through our proprietary Total Care System (“TCS”). At the core of our TCS system is DyrctAxess, our patented technology platform. DyrctAxess is designed to offer enhanced efficiency, control and access to the information necessary to empower patients, physicians and manufacturers to achieve optimal care.
 
We began marketing Prestalia®, a single-pill FDC of perindopril arginine (“perindopril”) and amlodipine besylate (“amlodipine”) in June of 2018. By combining Prestalia, DyrctAxess and an independent pharmacy network, we have created a proprietary system for drug adherence and the effective treatment of hypertension, improving the distribution of FDC hypertensive drugs, such as our FDA-approved product Prestalia, as well as improving the distribution of devices for therapeutic drug monitoring (“TDM”) (e.g., blood pressure monitors), as well as patient counseling and prescription reminder services. We are focused on demonstrating the therapeutic and commercial value of TCS through the commercialization of Prestalia. Prestalia was developed in coordination with Servier, a French pharmaceutical conglomerate, that sells the formulation outside the United States under the brand names Coveram® and/or Viacoram®. Prestalia was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in January 2015 and is distributed through our DyrctAxess platform which, as noted above, we acquired in 2017.
 
We have discontinued all significant clinical development and are evaluating disposition options for all of our development assets, including: (i) our next generation celecoxib program drug candidates for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, IT-102 and IT-103; (ii) CEQ508, an oral delivery of small interfering RNA (“siRNA”) against beta-catenin, combined with IT-102 to suppress polyps in the precancerous syndrome and orphan indication Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (“FAP”); (iii) CEQ508 combined with IT-103 to treat Colorectal Cancer; (iv) CEQ608 and CEQ609, an oral delivery of IL-6Ra tkRNAi against irritable bowel disease (IBD) gene targets, which could significantly reduce colon length and abolish the IL-6Rα message in proximal ileum; (v) Claudin-2 strains which (CEQ631 and CEQ632) significantly reduce Claudin-2 mRNA expression and protein levels in the colon as well as attenuation of the disease phenotype and enhance survival; (vi) MIP3a therapeutic strains CEQ631 and CEQ632 which also resulted in a significant reduction in sum pathology scores and reduction in MIP3a mRNA expression. We plan to license or divest these development assets since they no longer align with our focus on the treatment of hypertension.
 
As our strategy is to be a commercial pharmaceutical company, we will drive a primary corporate focus on revenue generation through our commercial assets, with a focus on developing our technology and TCS. We intend to create value through the continued commercialization of our FDA-approved product, Prestalia, while continuing to develop and leverage our TCS to further strengthen our commercial presence.
 
Background
 
On November 15, 2016, Adhera entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IThenaPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation, IThena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of IThena (“Merger Sub”), and Vuong Trieu, Ph.D. as the IThena representative (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThena, with IThena surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adhera (such transaction, the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThena common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Adhera common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.

Adhera was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name Nastech Pharmaceutical Company on September 23, 1983, and IThena was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 3, 2014. IThena is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and thus the historical financial statements of IThena will be treated as the historical financial statements of our company and will be reflected in our quarterly and annual reports for periods ending after the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we started to report the results of IThena and Adhera and their respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 
Prior to the Merger, Adhera’s pipeline consisted of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. That pipeline included CEQ508, a product in clinical development for the treatment of FAP, for which Adhera received both Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation from the FDA, as well as preclinical programs for the treatment of type 1 myotonic dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The IThena pipeline of celecoxib FDCs is now incorporated into the combined company.
 
As noted above, given our current business focus, we plan to divest many of the pre-Merger assets of Adhera and IThena as soon as reasonably practicable. In conjunction with that strategy, in September 2017 we divested our SMARTICLES asset as it is no longer a strategic fit, as described under “Partnering and Licensing Agreements - Novosom” below.
 
Subsequent to the Merger, we executed on our strategy to become a commercial stage pharmaceutical company by acquiring Prestalia from Symplmed in June 2017. Prestalia is an FDA-approved and marketed anti-hypertensive drug. Prestalia is an FDC of perindopril arginine, which is an ACE inhibitor, and amlodipine besylate, which is a calcium-channel blocker (CCB) and is indicated as a first line therapy for hypertension control.
 
The acquisition of Prestalia transitioned our company from a clinical stage company to a commercial organization. Prestalia was approved by the FDA in January 2015 and has been marketed in select U.S. states since then by Symplmed. Prestalia sales saw a solid growth through September of 2016, via new patient acquisition and strong patient retention. Due to funding circumstances experienced by Symplmed, further sales promotion of Prestalia were ceased by the end of 2016, and in June 2017 we acquired the Prestalia assets from Symplmed. Our current focus is dedicated to the promotion and commercialization of Prestalia.
 
Need for Future Financing
 
We will require additional funds to implement the growth strategy for our business. We have, in the past, raised additional capital to supplement our commercialization, clinical development and operational expenses. We will need to raise additional funds required through equity financing, debt financing, strategic alliances or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis as required, or generate significant material revenues from operations, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.

Hypertension Market
 
Hypertension (HTN) affects approximately 1 billion people worldwide and the number of patients is projected to increase to 1.56 billion people by 2025 [http://www.world-heart-federation.org/cardiovascular-health/cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors/hypertension/]. While HTN can be controlled with drugs and lifestyle changes in the majority of patients, uncontrolled or resistant HTN is a significant unmet clinical need in 22% of the HTN population [Persell, S. D. (2011). Prevalence of Resistant Hypertension in the United States, 2003-2008. Hypertension, 57: 1076-108]. Resistant HTN is defined as the failure to reach controlled BP with at least a three-drug regimen at optimal dosage, including at least one diuretic [The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: The JNC 7 report. JAMA. 2003;289:2560–72.]. Approximately 22% of the 1 billion HTN patients worldwide are affected by resistant HTN. Assuming a 4% penetration rate and an estimated price of $100 per 30 pills, there is over a $1 billion resistant HTN market. The recent clinical failure of renal denervation means limited competition “Despite meeting primary safety endpoints, SYMPLICITY HTN-3 – the pivotal U.S. trial examining renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertension – has fallen short of its secondary efficacy goals and failed to reach its primary efficacy endpoint as announced earlier this year by the study’s sponsor.” [SYMPLICITY HTN-3: Renal Artery Denervation Fails for Resistant HTN. March 29, 2014]. Without renal denervation, there are limited treatment options for resistant HTN except for potentially adding chlorthalidone and spironolactone if there is an underlying fluid retention problem.
 
As defined by the American Heart Association Scientific Statement on Resistant Hypertension in 2008, resistant hypertension refers to patients having uncontrolled BP (>140/90mmHg) despite use of three or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic. The prevalence of resistant hypertension from various cohorts is estimated to be around 10–20% of patients being treated for hypertension [Mohammed Siddiqui and David A. Calhoun. Refractory versus resistant hypertension. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 2017, 26:14–19]. As would be expected with a history of poorly controlled, often severe hypertension, patients with resistant hypertension have a worse cardiovascular disease prognosis, including coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease, compared with patients with more easily controlled hypertension. Similarly, patients with resistant hypertension are more likely to develop chronic kidney disease. Not surprisingly, given this increased cardiovascular risk, having resistant hypertension is associated with an overall higher mortality compared with nonresistant hypertension [Mohammed Siddiqui and David A. Calhoun. Refractory versus resistant hypertension. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 2017, 26:14–19].
 
In the U.S., 37 of the 50 states have a hypertension rate of greater than 30% of their residents. According to JNC VII (Joint national committee on hypertension), only 1/3 of patients will be controlled by a single product, meaning that 2/3 of all patients will require more than one class of medication to control their high blood pressure (reference https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9626/). First line therapy, initial treatment for all hypertension patients should include either a CCB, ACEi, Angiotensin receptor blocker or diuretic.
 
The hypertension market will continue to be large, but with the proliferation of generics, the branded pharmaceutical participation in sales and promotion will likely continue to decline. For our company, the opportunity exists to promote a branded combination, comprised of the two highest prescribed categories in hypertension. Only one product of a similar type, an ACEi and Amlodipine (the CCB that controls over 90% of the CCB market) has ever been promoted and sold in the U.S. That product, Lotrel®, had peak sales of $1.3 billion in the U.S. alone. This level of sales was experienced by Novartis in 2008 and achieved when there were over 15 large pharmaceutical companies, including Wyeth, Novartis, AstraZeneca, King, Forrest, Takeda, Merck, Sanofi and multiple others fighting for share of voice and positioning with patients and physicians. Currently, only two companies other than us compete in the hypertension market in the U.S., Allergan, selling a beta blocker, Bystolic, with over $500 million in sales in 2015, and Arbor, selling an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker, Edarbi and EdarbiChlor – an FDC of Edarbi and chlortahlidone. The edarbi franchise is selling in excess of $100 million annually.
 
The benchmark for our hypertension product, Prestalia, is Lotrel. Lotrel is the only FDC of an ACEi and amlodipine and is currently responsible as a brand and generic combined for a total prescription volume in excess of 11 million annually. The product is not promoted, and through analysis of the Prestalia clinical data in market research, Prestalia has been termed by physicians as ‘better than Lotrel’. The success of the Lotrel brand was driven by the combination of two classes of medication that had not only shown the ability to reduce blood pressure but, via the Camelot study for amlodipine and the HOPE and Europa study for ramipril and perindopril, the ability to lower cardiovascular events beyond the effect of lowering blood pressure. The potential success of Prestalia in the U.S. is further supported by the data outside the U.S., which has shown that our worldwide partner, Servier, has produced in excess of €400 million in annual sales of perindopril and amlodipine as an FDC.

In summary, as one looks at the opportunity for our Prestalia product, there are three key concepts:
 

1) | The market of patient opportunity continues to grow, and the top two dispensed categories are ACEi and Amlodipine; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | The competitive landscape regarding promotion to physicians leaves Prestalia as one of the few branded, patent-protected products; and 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) | The category of ACEi/CCB combination has been validated through the success of Lotrel with $1.3 billion in peak sales, and further validated for Prestalia with sales by Servier in excess of €400 million outside the U.S. 

Total Care Platform for Hypertension
 
Adherence to medications is a major challenge that clinicians often face in treating hypertension. An increasing number of studies show TDM is reliable for detecting medication nonadherence in patients who seem to have resistant hypertension (RH) [Jung O, Gechter JL, Wunder C, et al. Resistant hypertension? Assessment of adherence by toxicological urine analysis. J Hypertens. 2013; 31:766–774; Ceral J, Habrdova V, Vorisek V, Bima M, Pelouch R, Solar M. Difficult-to-control arterial hypertension or uncooperative patients? The assessment of serum antihypertensive drug levels to differentiate non-responsiveness from non-adherence to recommended therapy. Hypertens Res. 2011; 34:87–90.]. Strauch et al. [Strauch B, Petrak O, Zelinka T, et al. Precise assessment of noncompliance with the antihypertensive therapy in patients with resistant hypertension using toxicological serum analysis. J Hypertens 2013; 31:2455–2461] found medication nonadherence among a cohort of patients with resistant hypertension to be 47%, also having directly measured drug or appropriate metabolite levels by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. In fact, Brinker et al [Stephanie Brinker et al., Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Facilitates Blood Pressure Control in Resistant Hypertension. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2014 March 4; 63(8): 834–835] found that over one-half (54%) of patients who underwent TDM were found to be nonadherent to treatment and when patients were informed of their undetectable serum drug levels and provided additional counseling, BP control was markedly improved without increasing treatment intensity.

To this effect, we have developed a TCS consisting of four pillars to achieve improved compliance and therefore targeted BP: 1) FDCs. We believe hypertension is most effectively treated with combination therapy. Furthermore, hypertensive patients frequently suffer from other diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, arthritis, diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer, etc. Their pill burden can be upward of 10-15 pills per day. Any reduction in pill burden would increase compliance. 2) Monitoring- TDM as well as BP monitoring has been shown to improve compliance. With our current bpCareConnect, patients are provided with a BP monitoring system which allows both patients and health care provider to track treatment progress. We plan to upgrade the system to include cardiac monitoring devices as we further refine and enhance our platform. 3) Our program has healthcare practitioners and pharmacists call the patients and remind them to refill their prescriptions. This results in a refill rate ranging from 59.5% - 95%,1 which is higher than the industry standard of 50%. This low turnover of patients allows us to build prescriptions rapidly during our launch of Prestalia. Together, this TCS will transform care for hypertension and, in addition, could support patients dealing with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Below is the summary of our TCS, which focuses on patient compliance to achieve target BP control.


The demand for improved adherence will continue to drive the development of FDCs, which is one of the pillars for our TCS. The need for FDCs in the TCS for hypertensive patients is shown below. Combination therapy administered as an FDC has superior efficacy and better tolerance, which is supplemented by higher adherence. Therefore, healthcare providers should not be reluctant to prioritize the use of FDCs over up-titration and switching strategies for addressing efficacy-related issues, particularly if a patient has a history of poor adherence. Compared with free-drug combinations (where each BP drug is administered as a single pill), the use of FDCs of hypertensive agents is associated with a significant improvement in compliance and persistence with therapy and with possible beneficial trends on BP levels and reported adverse effects [Gupta AK et al., Compliance, Safety, and Effectiveness of Fixed-Dose Combinations of antihypertensive agents. A meta-analysis. Hypertension 2010; 55:399-407]. A meta-analysis showed that BP reduction by using two drugs in combination is approximately five times greater than doubling the dose of one drug [Krousel-Wood M et al., Medication adherence: a key factor in achieving blood pressure control and good clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients. In this context, Prestalia is ideally suited to the TCS because 1) it is approved for first line therapy; 2) clinical data has shown that it can achieve rapid and sustained BP reduction; and 3) it is approved only in three strengths – therefore simplifying dose titration versus complicated dose titration scheme of single agent and then double agent.
 

1 The refill rate is calculated monthly by dividing the cumulative number of existing patients by the total cumulative number of original patients since launch in June 2018.

To further expand our pipeline of FDCs, we plan to continue to acquire, in-license, or internally develop FDCs that lend themselves to the TCS, as resources allow, and opportunities arise.
 
We intend to initially advance sales of Prestalia in the U.S. through the TCS.
 
Prestalia
 
Acquired in June 2017, Prestalia is a commercially available product. We are currently integrating the distribution, marketing and sales platform of the acquired assets into our company. This is being done concurrently with efforts to mobilize a sales force and build on the existing patient/prescription base of Prestalia and build a strong revenue base. The non-U.S. market for FDCs of ACE inhibitor and CCB is over $300 million and we believe that this market is underserved in the U.S.
 
Prestalia was developed in conjunction with Les Laboratories, Servier. It was launched in October of 2015 and was driven to 1,615 prescriptions per month with only 10 sales representatives. It is approved in three doses: 3.5/2.5, 7/5 and 14/10 and is promoted worldwide ex-US as Coveram and/or Viacoram by Servier with >$400 million annual turnover from perindopril franchise, WW, for Servier.
 
Prestalia is a unique FDC drug that simplified dose titration to only three dose strengths. Prestalia is approved for fist line hypertension and titration can be done with just Prestalia with only three dose levels to adjust unlike performing titration of each drug alone where there are at least three strengths for each drug requiring titrating through at least six different strengths and strength combinations. Lisinopril alone has six dose strengths. Per package insert information: Initiate treatment at 3.5/2.5 mg, once daily. Adjust dose according to blood pressure goals waiting 1 to 2 weeks between titration steps. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS: Tablets (perindopril arginine/amlodipine): 3.5/2.5 mg, 7/5 mg and14/10 mg.
 
Prestalia is one of a few products with an active component to demonstrate event reduction across the CV continuum. In aggregate there was reduction in cardiovascular morbidity-mortality in randomized clinical trials with more than 54,000 patients. Various clinical trials have shown that despite lowering blood pressure not all drugs effectively reduce heart attack, stroke and death. In the CAMELOT trial, which compared amlodipine vs. enalapril – another ACEI – for 24 months, there was 31% vs 15% fewer events with amlodipine. In the EUROPA trial, using perindopril, compared to placebo in 12,000 ACS (64% had previous MI) reduced CV events by 20%. Post-hoc analysis of EUROPA showed that for subjects on any CCB for 4.2 years and either on perindopril or placebo, the event rate was 46% less for patients on perindopril and CCB than for patients on a CCB and placebo.

Commercialization Plan
 
The two main challenges to the uptake of a drug are getting physicians to prescribe it and getting insurance reimbursement for its use. Prior to its acquisition by our company, Prestalia had achieved a patient base of approximately 1,500 patients and approximately 400 prescribers; over two years. With the demonstrated history of physician acceptance and steady acceptance by insurers, combined with the fact that combination of ACEi and CCB are well characterized and understood, we believe that our ability to penetrate the market is heavily influenced by the number of people we are able to engage to assist in our commercialization efforts.
 
In terms of execution, we are taking a targeted approach capitalizing on geographies with favorable conditions for Prestalia, including a high degree of hypertension within the territory. Our targeting efforts from the physician perspective are focused on identifying high prescribers of FDC therapy that includes ACEi and CCB use, along with those physicians writing ACE/Diuretic combinations. An additional key to our targeting will be high prescribers of each of these as concomitant monotherapy, or individual use. This approach will allow us to focus our message on physicians that are already committed to the components, and do not require a clinical communication to convert them from use of other classes of medications.
 
To ensure that we convert the highest percentage of prescriptions generated to new patients, along with keeping our existing patients on medication, we have an expansive patient co-pay support program through our pharmacy partners. This program will be specifically dedicated to ensuring that all patients receive medication, covered or not, so that we can ensure patients and physicians are satisfied, as well as put us in a position to continue expanding insurance coverage.

Rosetta
 
On April 1, 2014, we entered into a strategic alliance with Rosetta to identify and develop microRNA- (“miRNA”) based products designed to diagnose and treat various neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies. Under the terms of the alliance, Rosetta will apply its industry leading miRNA discovery expertise for the identification of miRNAs involved in the various dystrophy diseases. If the miRNA is determined to be correlative to the disease, Rosetta may further develop the miRNA into a diagnostic for patient identification and stratification. If the miRNA is determined to be involved in the disease pathology and represents a potential therapeutic target, Adhera may develop the resulting miRNA-based therapeutic for clinical development. The alliance is exclusive as it relates to neuromuscular diseases and dystrophies, with both companies free to develop and collaborate outside this field both during and after the terms of the alliance.
Novartis
 
On August 2, 2012, we and Novartis entered into a worldwide, non-exclusive License Agreement for the CRN technology for the development of both single and double-stranded oligonucleotide therapeutics. Novartis made a $1.0 million one-time payment for the non-exclusive license. In addition, in March 2009, we granted to Novartis a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to the DiLA2-based siRNA delivery platform in consideration of a one-time, non-refundable fee of $7.25 million. Novartis may terminate this agreement immediately upon written notice.
Monsanto
 
On May 3, 2012, we and Monsanto entered into a worldwide exclusive Intellectual Property License Agreement for our delivery and chemistry technologies. We and Monsanto also entered into a Security Agreement pursuant to which we granted to Monsanto a security interest in that portion of our IP that is the subject of the License Agreement in order to secure the performance of our obligations under the License Agreement. Monsanto paid $1.5 million in initiation fees and may be required to pay royalties on product sales in the low single digit percentages. Monsanto may terminate the License Agreement at any time in whole or as to any rights granted thereunder upon three months’ prior written notice.
Novosom
 
On July 27, 2010, we acquired the intellectual property of Novosom for SMARTICLES. As per the terms of the acquisition agreement (the “Original Purchase Agreement”), we were required to pay to Novosom an amount equal to 30% of the value of each upfront (or combined) payment actually received in respect of the license of liposomal-based delivery technology or related product or disposition of the liposomal-based delivery technology by us, up to $3.3 million, which amount was to be paid in shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our discretion. On September 8, 2017, we entered into an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement (the “IP Purchase Agreement”) with Novosom pursuant to which we sold to Novosom substantially all of our intellectual property estate relating to SMARTICLES (the “Smarticles IP”), including that acquired pursuant to the Original Purchase Agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.00. As per the IP Purchase Agreement, we will retain rights to any future payments that may be due to us pursuant to those agreements that we entered into with third parties pursuant to which we provided to such third parties certain licenses and rights with respect to the Smarticles IP, including milestone and royalty payments, if any, and Novosom relinquished any rights that it may have under the Original Purchase Agreement to any portion of such payments.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals
 
On March 23, 2010, we acquired intellectual property related to the CRN chemistry from Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America (“Valeant”). Subject to meeting certain milestones triggering the obligation to make any such payments, we may be obligated to make a product development milestone payment of $5.0 million and $2.0 million within 180 days of FDA approval of an NDA for our first and second CRN related product, respectively. To date, we have not made any such milestone payments but have milestone obligations of $0.1 million based on CRN licenses to date. Valeant is entitled to receive earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low single digits of future commercial sales and earn-outs based upon a percentage in the low double digits of future revenue from sublicensing. We are required to pay Valeant an annual amount equal to $50,000 per assigned patent which shall be creditable against other payment obligations. The term of our financial obligations under the agreement shall end, on a country-by-country basis, when there no longer exists any valid claim in such country. We may terminate the agreement upon 30-day notice, or upon 10-day notice in the event of adverse results from clinical studies.

Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property
 
We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There can be no assurance that any of our patents will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access external technologies and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or controlled the U.S. and foreign granted and allowed patents, and the pending patent applications, to protect our proprietary technologies, as set forth in the table below.

Jurisdiction | Number of Granted / Allowed Patents | | Number of Pending Patents Applications 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+----+-------------------------------------------
China | | 1 | | 0
Brazil | | 0 | | 1
Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Slovania, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, U.K. | | 35 | | 0

Australia | | 3 | | 1
European Patent Office | | 6 | | 3
Japan | | 6 | | 0
United States | | 12 | | 3
New Zealand | | 1 | | 0



The patents listed in the table above expire from 2023 to 2030, subject to any potential patent term extensions and/or supplemental protection certificates that would extend the terms of the patents in countries where such extensions may become available.
 
Further, as discussed elsewhere in this report, we have licensed rights to our FDA-approved product, Prestalia, from Les Laboratoires Servier as a result of our acquisition of assets from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals in June 2017. The patents listed in the FDA Orange Book as having claims covering Prestalia, U.S. Patent No. 6,696,481 and 7,846,961, expire in 2023 and 2027, respectively.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to produce our products in accordance with applicable provisions of the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) regulations. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive GMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.

Sales and Marketing
 
We began our commercial sales effort in second quarter of 2018 and promote our product through a sales force of 20 territory managers. During the second and third quarters of 2018, we collaborated with a third-party sales force to market Prestalia to health care professionals. During the third quarter of 2018, we initiated a plan to insource the sales force, which was largely completed during the first quarter of 2019. Our team is comprised of a complete support staff internally, and we also partner with numerous specialty vendors to increase our effectiveness and efficiency.
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our products and product candidates are their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Our products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize, will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, product acquisition, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete, or may compete, with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and products complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.
 
The commercial opportunity for our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may acquire or develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drugs and pharmaceutical products. Our Prestalia product is, and all of the products that we may seek to commercialize are expected to be, regulated as drug products.
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and other laws within the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions. Before our drug products are marketed, they must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a novel drug product is approved by the FDA include: (1) pre-clinical laboratory, animal, and formulation tests; (2) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; (3) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; (4) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); (5) satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and FDA review; and finally (6) approval of an NDA.

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician-investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed, to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks; and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population. To the extent that we engage in any product development activities, our product development partners, the FDA, or we may suspend clinical trials, if any, at any time on various grounds, including any situation where we or our partners believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information. If the FDA approves the NDA, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP in December 2010. As of the date of this report, we have suspended development activities regarding CEQ508, as well as our other programs relating to RNA interference.
 
In addition, regardless of the type of approval, we and our partners are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements both before and after approval with respect to any products that we may develop, acquire or commercialize. For example, we and our partners are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.

In addition to FDA regulations for the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:
 

● | The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment; 
● | The federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government; 
● | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials; 
● | State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; 
● | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which among other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure; and 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information; 

 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. Currently none of our products are sold outside the United States.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the United States, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.

-16-
----

 

In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved products. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
 
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription, pharmacy drugs pursuant to federal regulations. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products that we commercialize. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payers do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The United States is considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the ACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expansion of Medicaid benefits and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and expansion of the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.

For example, members of Congress and the Trump administration have expressed an intent to pass legislation or adopt executive orders to fundamentally change or repeal parts of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing the individual insurance coverage mandate included in ACA, effective January 1, 2019. Further, on January 20, 2017, an Executive Order was signed directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, an Executive Order was signed terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amends the ACA effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Moreover, CMS issued a final rule in 2018 that will give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal in December 2018, and both the Trump Administration and CMS have stated the ruling will have no immediate impact, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA. The implications of the ACA, its possible repeal, any legislation that may be proposed to replace the ACA, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation for our business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.
 
The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the U.S. recently has also been the subject of considerable discussion in the U.S., and members of Congress and the Trump administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. To date, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. The Trump administration released a “Blueprint,” or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The Trump administration’s Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. For example, on October 25, 2018, CMS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or ANPRM, indicating it is considering issuing a proposed rule in the spring of 2019 on a model called the International Pricing Index. This model would utilize a basket of other countries’ prices as a reference for the Medicare program to use in reimbursing for drugs covered under Part B. The ANPRM also included an updated version of the Competitive Acquisition Program, as an alternative to current “buy and bill” payment methods for Part B drugs. Such a proposed rule could limit our product pricing and have material adverse effects on our business.
 
Individual state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. Some of these measures include price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
 

-18-

We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the U.S. to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from our products, including Prestalia, and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to commercialize our products.
 
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products Hatch-Waxman Patent Exclusivity
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication.
 
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the listed patent has expired; 
● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product. 

 
Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
 

-19-

Hatch-Waxman Non-Patent Exclusivity
 
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
 
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Product Liability
 
We currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of development, including the marketing and sale of Prestalia. Any product liability insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Environmental Compliance
 
To the extent that we engage in research and development, which activities are not currently being actively pursued by us, such activities may involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements. At this time, we are not conducting any R&D activities that require compliance with federal, state or local laws.
Employees
 
As of April 8, 2019, we had 24 employees, of whom one is an officer of our company. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In addition to our employees, from time to time as circumstances have required, we have engaged, and anticipate that we will continue to engage, competent third-party consultants to supplement the existing employee resources of our company including with respect to our accounting and financial reporting functions.
Company Information
 
We are a reporting company and are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy these reports, proxy statements and other information at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 or e-mail the SEC at publicinfo@sec.gov for more information on the operation of the public reference room.
