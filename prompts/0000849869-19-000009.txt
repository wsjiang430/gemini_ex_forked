SDS represents a strategically important acquisition for us, providing us with an opportunity to expand our closures franchise.
OUR STRATEGY
We intend to enhance our position as a leading manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products by continuing to aggressively pursue a strategy designed to achieve future growth and increase shareholder value by focusing on the following key elements:
SUPPLY “BEST VALUE” PACKAGING PRODUCTS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF QUALITY, SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT
Since our inception, we have been, and intend to continue to be, devoted to consistently supplying our products with the combination of quality, price and service that our customers consider to be “best value.” In our metal container business, we focus on providing high quality and high levels of service and utilizing our low cost producer position. We have made and are continuing to make significant capital investments to offer our customers value-added features such as our family of Quick Top® easy-open ends for our metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food, including a new manufacturing facility in the United States completed in 2016 to better optimize the logistical footprint of our metal containers business. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a smaller, near-site manufacturing facility in the United States to support growth of certain customers. In our closures business, we emphasize high levels of quality, service and technological support. We believe our closures business is the premier innovative closures and dispensing systems solutions provider to the food, beverage, health care, garden, personal care, home and beauty industries. We offer customers an extensive variety of metal and plastic closures for food and beverage products, as well as proprietary equipment solutions such as cap feeders, cappers and detection systems, to ensure high quality package safety. We also manufacture throughout the world a wide range of highly engineered dispensing systems for health care, garden, personal care, home, beauty and food products. In our plastic container business, we provide high levels of quality and service and focus on value-added, custom designed plastic containers to meet changing product and packaging demands of our customers. We believe that we are one of the few plastic 
3

packaging businesses that can custom design, manufacture and decorate a wide variety of plastic containers, providing the customer with the ability to satisfy more of its plastic packaging needs through one supplier. We will continue to supply customized products that can be delivered quickly to our customers with superior levels of design, development and technological support. We have made strategic investments to enhance the competitive position of our plastic container business, including the construction of two new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States that were completed in 2016, one of which is a near-site facility to a major customer and the other of which is to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility in the United States in support of continued growth.
MAINTAIN LOW COST PRODUCER POSITION
We will continue pursuing opportunities to strengthen our low cost position in our business by:

• | maintaining a flat, efficient organizational structure, resulting in low selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales;


• | achieving and maintaining economies of scale;


• | prudently investing in new technologies to increase manufacturing and production efficiency;


• | rationalizing our existing plant structure; and


• | serving our customers from our strategically located plants.

Through our metal container facilities, we believe that we provide the most comprehensive manufacturing capabilities in the industry. Through our closures business, we manufacture an extensive variety of metal and plastic closures and highly engineered dispensing systems for the food, beverage, health care, garden, personal care, home and beauty industries throughout the world utilizing state-of-the-art technology and equipment, and we also provide our customers for our closures with state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems. Through our plastic container facilities, we have the capacity to manufacture customized products across the entire spectrum of resin materials, decorating techniques and molding processes required by our customers. We intend to leverage our manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities to continue to create cost-effective manufacturing systems that will drive our improvements in product quality, operating efficiency and customer support.
In 2016, we completed optimization plans in each of our businesses that reduced manufacturing and logistical costs and provided productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets. In conjunction with these optimization plans, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities. The three new manufacturing facilities are strategically located to meet the unique needs of our customers. 
In 2018, we commercialized a new metal container manufacturing facility and a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility, in each case to support continued growth in key markets.
MAINTAIN AN OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Our financial strategy is to use reasonable leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns. Our stable and predictable cash flow, generated largely as a result of our long-term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business, supports our financial strategy. We intend to continue using reasonable leverage, supported by our stable cash flows, to make value enhancing acquisitions. In determining reasonable leverage, we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes. In 2016, we used cash on hand and revolving loan borrowings under our then existing senior secured credit facility, or our 2014 Credit Facility, to fund repurchases of our common stock for $277.3 million (which included $269.4 million of our common stock purchased pursuant to a "modified Dutch auction" tender offer that was completed in November 2016). In February 2017, we issued $300 million of our 4¾% Senior Notes due 2025, or the 4¾% Notes, and €650 million of our 3¼% Senior Notes due 2025, or the 3¼% Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 4¾% Notes to prepay a portion of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans and repay a portion of our outstanding revolving loans under our 2014 Credit Facility. We used the net proceeds 
4

from the 3¼% Notes to prepay all outstanding Euro term loans and repay all remaining outstanding revolving loans under our 2014 Credit Facility, to repay certain foreign bank revolving and term loans of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and to redeem $220 million of our outstanding 5% Senior Notes due 2020, or the 5% Notes. In March 2017, we completed an amendment and restatement of our 2014 Credit Facility and entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility, which extended the maturity dates of our senior secured credit facility, provides additional borrowing capacity for us and provides us with greater flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. In May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated senior secured credit facility, as so amended, our Credit Agreement, which further extended maturity dates, lowered the margin on borrowings thereunder and provides additional flexibility with regard to strategic initiatives. Our Credit Agreement provides us with revolving loans, consisting of a multicurrency revolving loan facility of approximately $1.19 billion and a Canadian revolving loan facility of Cdn $15.0 million. Additionally, our Credit Agreement provided us with term loans, consisting of (i) U.S. $800 million of term loans designated U.S. A term loans and (ii) Cdn $45.5 million of term loans designated Canadian A term loans. In April 2017, we funded the purchase price for SDS with the $800 million of U.S. A term loans and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In April 2018, we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding 5% Notes ($280.0 million aggregate principal amount) with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. You should also read Notes 3 and 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
EXPAND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND INTERNAL GROWTH
We intend to continue to increase our market share in our current business lines and related business lines through acquisitions and internal growth. We use a disciplined approach to make acquisitions and investments that generate attractive cash returns. As a result, we expect to continue to expand and diversify our customer base, geographic presence and product lines. This strategy has enabled us to increase our net sales and income from operations over the last ten years. 
We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, primarily as a result of our acquisitions but also as a result of growth with existing customers. During the past 30 years, the metal food container market in North America has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self-manufacture their metal food containers. Our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of Nestlé Food Company, or Nestlé, The Dial Corporation, or Dial, Del Monte Corporation, or Del Monte, Birds Eye Foods, Inc., or Birds Eye, Campbell Soup Company, or Campbell, Pacific Coast Producers, or Pacific Coast, and Nestlé Purina PetCare's steel container self-manufacturing assets, or Purina Steel Can, reflect this trend. We estimate that approximately seven percent of the market for metal food containers in the United States is still served by self-manufacturers.
While we have expanded our metal container business and increased our market share of metal containers primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers, we have also made over the last several years, and are continuing to make, significant capital investments in our metal container business to enhance our business and offer our customers value-added features, such as our family of Quick Top® easy-open ends for metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In 2018, approximately 70 percent of our metal food containers sold had an easy-open end. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2016, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility in Burlington, Iowa to better optimize the logistical footprint of our metal container operations in North America, allowing us to further reduce costs of our metal container business. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a smaller, near-site manufacturing facility in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania to support growth of certain customers.
With our acquisitions of our closures operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal and plastic closures and dispensing systems for food, beverage, health care, garden, personal care, home and beauty products. In 2017, we broadened our closures portfolio to include dispensing systems with our acquisition of SDS. Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, net sales of our closures business have increased sevenfold to $1.46 billion in 2018 as a result of acquisitions and internal growth. We may pursue further consolidation opportunities in the closures markets in which we operate, including in dispensing systems, or in adjacent closures markets. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate internal growth in our closures business, particularly in plastic closures and dispensing systems. In making investments to pursue internal growth, we use a disciplined approach to generate attractive cash returns.
5

We have grown our market position for our plastic container business since 1987, with net sales increasing sevenfold to $614.1 million in 2018. We achieved this improvement primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth. In 2016, we completed construction of two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, including a near-site facility to a major customer and another facility to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. These new facilities are located in North East, Pennsylvania and Hazelwood, Missouri. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas in support of continued growth. The plastic containers segment of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented, and we intend to pursue further consolidation opportunities in this market. We also expect to continue to generate internal growth in our plastic container business. As with acquisitions, we use a disciplined approach to pursue internal growth to generate attractive cash returns. Through a combination of these efforts, we intend to continue to expand our customer base in the markets that we serve, such as the personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical markets.
ENHANCE PROFITABILITY THROUGH PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTIONS
We intend to continue to enhance profitability through investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions, and the optimization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. The additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions and investments have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings. From 2014, we have closed four metal container manufacturing facilities, one closure manufacturing facility and four plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations, reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand. 
We expect that most future acquisitions will continue to enable us to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and other benefits from economies of scale and the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions. In addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses, we have improved and expect to continue to improve the operating performance of our plant facilities by investing capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies and manufacturing cost reductions. While we have made some of these investments in certain of our plants, more opportunities still exist throughout our system. We will continue to use a disciplined approach to identify these opportunities to generate attractive cash returns.
In 2016, we completed optimization plans in each of our businesses that reduced manufacturing and logistical costs and provided productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets.  In conjunction with these optimization plans, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities.  The three new manufacturing facilities are strategically located to meet the unique needs of our customers. 
In 2018, we commercialized a new metal container manufacturing facility and a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility, in each case to support continued growth in key markets.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We are a holding company that conducts our business through various operating subsidiaries. We operate three businesses, our metal container business, our closures business and our plastic container business.
METAL CONTAINERS—53.5 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2018
We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2018 of slightly more than half of the market. Our metal container business is engaged in the manufacture and sale of steel and aluminum containers that are used primarily by processors and packagers for food products, such as pet food, vegetables, soup, proteins (e.g., meat, chicken and seafood), tomato based products, adult nutritional drinks, fruit and other miscellaneous food products, as well as general line metal containers primarily for chemicals. We have 44 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. For 2018, our metal container business had net sales of $2.38 billion (approximately 53.5 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $198.8 million (approximately 46.1 percent of 
6

our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales in 2019 will be pursuant to multi-year customer supply arrangements.
Although metal containers face competition from plastic, paper, glass and composite containers, we believe metal containers are superior to plastic, paper and composite containers in applications where the contents are prepared at high temperatures, or packaged in larger consumer or institutional quantities, or where the long-term storage of the product is desirable while maintaining the product’s quality. We also believe that metal containers are generally more desirable than glass containers because metal containers are more durable and less costly to transport. In addition, metal containers are one of the most recycled packages in the world and are infinitely recyclable. While the market for metal food containers in the United States has experienced little or no growth over the last ten years, we have increased our market share of metal food containers in the United States primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers, and have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high quality, high levels of service and value-added features such as our family of Quick Top® easy-open ends, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2016, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility in the United States to better optimize the logistical footprint of our metal container business in North America, allowing us to further reduce costs of our metal container business. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a smaller, near-site manufacturing facility in the United States to support growth of certain customers.
CLOSURES—32.7 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2018
We are a leading worldwide manufacturer of metal and plastic closures and dispensing systems for food, beverage, health care, garden, personal care, home and beauty products. Our closures business provides customers with an extensive variety of proprietary metal and plastic closures and innovative dispensing system solutions that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our closures product offering. We have 33 closure manufacturing facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, from which we serve over 70 countries throughout the world. In addition, we license our technology to five other manufacturers for various markets we do not serve directly. For 2018, our closures business had net sales of $1.46 billion (approximately 32.7 percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $189.9 million (approximately 44.0 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, we have grown our closures business through acquisitions and internal growth, with net sales increasing sevenfold.
We manufacture metal and plastic closures for food and beverage products, such as ready-to-drink teas, sports drinks, dairy products, tomato sauce, salsa, pickles, baby food, juice drinks, ketchup, preserves, soup, cooking sauces, gravies, fruits, vegetables and infant formula products. With our acquisition in 2017 of SDS, we broadened our closures portfolio to manufacture dispensing systems for health care, garden, personal care, home, beauty and food products, such as health care nasal spray and topical applications, lawn and garden products, hard surface cleaning products, professional cleaning products, air and fabric care products, perfume and fragrance products, skin care products, lotions, cosmetics, soaps, hair care products and other bath and body products and condiments. We provide customers of our closures business with custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, designed either to minimize removal torques and enhance openability of our closures or to maintain sealability of our closures, in each case to meet the unique needs of our customers while also meeting applicable regulatory requirements. We offer our customers an extensive range of decorating options for our closures for product differentiation. We also provide customers with sealing/capping equipment and detection systems to complement our closures product offering. As a result of our extensive range of closures, our geographic presence and our focus on providing high levels of quality, service and technological support, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to serve food, beverage, health care, garden, personal care, home and beauty product companies for their closure needs.
PLASTIC CONTAINERS—13.8 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2018
We produce plastic containers from a full range of resin materials and offer a comprehensive array of molding and decorating capabilities. We are one of the leading manufacturers of custom designed high density polyethylene, or HDPE, and polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, containers in North America for the markets that we serve. We are also a leading manufacturer in North America of plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for shelf-stable food products. We operate 23 plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada. For 2018, our plastic container business had net sales of $614.1 million (approximately 13.8 
7

percent of our consolidated net sales) and income from operations of $42.6 million (approximately 9.9 percent of our consolidated income from operations excluding corporate expense). Since 1987, we have improved our market position for our plastic container business, with net sales increasing sevenfold.
We manufacture custom designed and stock plastic containers for personal care and health care products, including containers for mouthwash, shampoos, conditioners, hand creams, lotions, liquid soap, respiratory and gastrointestinal products, cosmetics and toiletries; food and beverage products, including peanut butter, salad dressings, condiments, dairy products and liquor; household and industrial chemical products, including containers for lawn, garden and agricultural products, scouring cleaners and cleaning agents; and pharmaceutical products, including containers for tablets and antacids. In addition, we manufacture plastic thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for food products, such as soups and other ready-to-eat meals and pet food, as well as thermoformed plastic tubs for food, household and personal care products, including soft fabric wipes. We also manufacture plastic closures, caps, sifters and fitments for food and household products, including salad dressings, condiments, peanut butter, spices, liquid margarine, powdered drink mixes and arts and crafts supplies. 
Our leading position in the plastic container market is largely driven by our rapid response to our customers’ design, development and technology support needs and our value-added, diverse product line. This product line is the result of our ability to produce plastic containers from a full range of resin materials using a broad array of manufacturing, molding and decorating capabilities. We also strive to remain current with and, to some extent, anticipate innovations in resin composition and applications and changes in the technology for the manufacturing of plastic containers. We benefit from our large scale and nationwide presence, as significant consolidation is occurring in many of our customers’ markets. Through these capabilities, we are well-positioned to serve our customers, who demand customized solutions as they continue to seek innovative means to differentiate their products in the marketplace using packaging. In 2016, we completed the construction of two new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States, including a near-site facility to a major customer and another facility to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility in the United States in support of continued growth.
MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION
As is the practice in the industry, most of our customers provide us with periodic estimates of products and quantities pursuant to which commitments are given. These estimates enable us to effectively manage production and control working capital requirements. We schedule our production to meet customers’ requirements. Because the production time for our products is short, the backlog of customer orders in relation to our sales is not material.
As of February 1, 2019, we operated a total of 100 manufacturing facilities in 19 different countries throughout the world that serve the needs of our customers.
METAL CONTAINER BUSINESS
The manufacturing operations of our metal container business include cutting, coating, lithographing, fabricating, assembling and packaging finished cans. We use three basic processes to produce cans. The traditional three-piece method requires three pieces of flat metal to form a cylindrical body with a welded
side seam, a bottom and a top. High integrity of the side seam is assured by the use of sophisticated electronic weld monitors and coatings that are thermally cured by induction and convection processes. The other two methods of producing cans start by forming a shallow cup that is then formed into the desired height using either the draw and iron process or the draw and redraw process. Using the draw and redraw process, we manufacture steel and aluminum two-piece cans, the height of which generally does not exceed the diameter. For cans the height of which is greater than the diameter, we manufacture steel two-piece cans by using a drawing and ironing process. We manufacture can bodies and ends from thin, high-strength aluminum alloys and steels by utilizing proprietary tool and die designs and selected can making equipment. We also manufacture our Quick Top® easy-open ends from both steel and aluminum alloys in a sophisticated precision progressive die process. We regularly review our Quick Top® easy-open end designs for improvements for optimum consumer preference through consumer studies and feedback.
CLOSURES BUSINESS
The manufacturing operations for metal closures include cutting, coating, lithographing, fabricating and lining. We manufacture twist-off, lug style and press-on, twist-off steel closures and aluminum roll-on closures for glass, metal and plastic containers, ranging in size from 18 to 110 millimeters in diameter. We employ state-of-the-art

multi-die presses to manufacture metal closures, offering a low-cost, high quality means of production. We also provide customers of our closures business with custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, designed to minimize torque removal and enhance the openability of our closures while meeting applicable regulatory requirements.
We utilize two basic processes to produce plastic closures and dispensing systems. In the compression molded process, pellets of plastic resin are heated, extruded and then compressed to form a plastic closure shell. The plastic closure shell can include a molded linerless seal or a custom formulated, compression molded sealing system. The plastic closure shell can then be slit and printed depending on its end use. In the injection molded process, pellets of plastic resin are heated and injected into a mold, forming either a plastic closure shell or other dispensing systems component, such as a trigger, decorative shroud, actuator, valve or overcap. The plastic closure shell can include a molded linerless seal or a custom formulated sealing system. The plastic closure shell can then be slit and printed depending on its end use. In the case of a dispensing system, the dispensing system components are assembled into the dispensing system and can be printed depending on the end use of the dispensing system. 
PLASTIC CONTAINER BUSINESS
We utilize two basic processes to produce plastic containers. In the extrusion blowmolding process, pellets of plastic resin are heated and extruded into a tube of plastic. A two-piece metal mold is then closed around the plastic tube and high pressure air is blown into it causing a bottle to form in the mold’s shape. In the injection and injection stretch blowmolding processes, pellets of plastic resin are heated and injected into a mold, forming a plastic preform. The plastic preform is then blown into a bottle-shaped metal mold, creating a plastic bottle.
Our plastic thermoformed bowls, trays and tubs are manufactured by melting pellets of plastic resin into an extruded plastic sheet. The plastic sheet is then formed in a mold to make the plastic bowl, tray or tub.
We have state-of-the-art decorating equipment, including several of the largest sophisticated decorating facilities in the United States. Our decorating methods for plastic containers are in-mold labeling, which applies a plastic film label to the bottle during the blowing process, and post-mold decoration. Post-mold decoration includes:

• | silk screen decoration which enables the applications of images in multiple colors to the bottle;


• | pressure sensitive decoration which uses a plastic film or paper label with an adhesive;


• | heat transfer decoration which uses a plastic coated label applied by heat; and


• | shrink sleeve labeling.

RAW MATERIALS
Based upon our existing arrangements with suppliers and our current and anticipated requirements, we believe that we have made adequate provisions for acquiring our raw materials for the foreseeable future. As a result of significant consolidation of suppliers, we are, however, dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for our steel, aluminum, coatings and compound raw materials. Increases in the prices of raw materials have generally been passed along to our customers in accordance with our multi-year customer supply arrangements and through general price increases.
METAL CONTAINER BUSINESS
We use tinplated and chromium plated steel, aluminum, copper wire, organic coatings, lining compound and inks in the manufacture and decoration of our metal container products. Our material requirements are supplied through agreements and purchase orders with suppliers with whom we have long-term relationships. If our suppliers fail to deliver under their arrangements, we would be forced to purchase raw materials on the open market, and no assurances can be given that we would be able to purchase such raw materials or, if we are so able, that we would be able to purchase such raw materials at comparable prices or terms. Although there has been significant consolidation of suppliers, we believe that we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our customers' requirements for the foreseeable future.
Our metal container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our metal container customers without long-term agreements, we have also generally increased prices to pass through increases in our metal costs.

CLOSURES BUSINESS
We use tinplated and chromium plated steel, aluminum, organic coatings, low-metallic inks and pulpboard, plastic and organic lining materials in the manufacture of metal closures. We use resins in pellet form, such as homopolymer polypropylene, copolymer polypropylene and HDPE, thermoplastic elastomer lining materials, processing additives and colorants in the manufacture of plastic closures and dispensing systems. Although no assurances can be given, we believe we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our customers' requirements for the foreseeable future, despite the significant consolidation of suppliers.
Our closures supply agreements with our customers generally provide for the pass through of changes in our metal and resin costs, subject in many cases with respect to resin to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For our closures customers without long-term agreements, our closures business has also generally passed through changes in our metal and resin costs. 
PLASTIC CONTAINER BUSINESS
The raw materials we use in our plastic container business are primarily resins in pellet form such as virgin HDPE, virgin PET, recycled HDPE, recycled PET, polypropylene and, to a lesser extent, polystyrene, low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate glycol, polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate and medium density polyethylene. Our resin requirements are acquired through multi-year arrangements for specific quantities of resins with several major suppliers of resins. The price that we pay for resin raw materials is not fixed and is subject to market pricing, which has fluctuated significantly in the past few years. Our plastic container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our resin costs, subject in many cases to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For our plastic container customers without long-term agreements, our plastic container business has also generally passed through changes in our resin costs.
We believe that we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of resins to meet our customers' requirements for the foreseeable future, absent unforeseen events such as significant hurricanes.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our philosophy has been to develop long-term customer relationships by acting in partnership with our customers, providing reliable quality and service. We market our products primarily by a direct sales force, including manufacturer's representatives, and for our plastic container business, in part, through a network of distributors. Because of the high cost of transporting empty containers, our metal container business generally sells to customers within a 300 mile radius of its manufacturing plants.
Approximately 11 percent, 11 percent and 13 percent of our consolidated net sales were to Nestlé in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total consolidated net sales during those years.

METAL CONTAINER BUSINESS
We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2018 of slightly more than half of the market. We have 44 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. Our largest customers for these products include Bonduelle Group, Campbell, Conagra Brands, Inc., Crider Foods, Inc., Del Monte, General Mills, Inc., Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, The Kraft Heinz Company, Mars, Incorporated, Nestlé, Pacific Coast, Stanislaus Food Products Company and Teasdale Quality Foods, Inc. 
We have entered into multi-year supply arrangements with most of our customers for our metal container business. We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales in 2019 will be pursuant to multi-year customer supply arrangements. Historically, we have been successful in continuing these multi-year customer supply arrangements. In Europe, our metal container business has had long-term relationships with many of its customers, although, as is common practice, many supply arrangements are negotiated on a year-by-year basis.

Since our inception in 1987, we have supplied Nestlé with substantially all of its U.S. metal food container requirements. Our net sales of metal food containers to Nestlé in 2018 were $462.2 million. We also supply Nestlé with closures in North America and Europe and plastic containers in North America. In 2018, we entered into long-term supply agreements with Nestlé that run through 2025 for the supply of all of Nestlé’s North American metal food container requirements for pet food and other food products and to support growth initiatives of Nestlé. These long-term supply agreements replaced previous supply agreements with Nestlé. Each of these long-term supply agreements provide for certain prices and specify that those prices will be increased or decreased based upon price change formulas.
Our metal container business’ sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter. You should also read “Risk Factors—The seasonality of the fruit and vegetable packing industry causes us to incur short-term debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

COMPETITION
The packaging industry is highly competitive. We compete in this industry with manufacturers of similar and other types of packaging, as well as fillers, food processors and packers who manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. We attempt to compete effectively through the quality of our products, competitive pricing and our ability to meet customer requirements for delivery, performance and technical assistance.
METAL CONTAINER BUSINESS
Of the commercial metal container manufacturers, Ardagh Group, Ball Metalpack, LLC and Crown Holdings, Inc. are our most significant competitors. Our competitors also include other regional suppliers. As an alternative to purchasing containers from commercial can manufacturers, customers have the ability to invest in equipment to self-manufacture their containers.
Because of the high cost of transporting empty containers, our metal container business generally sells to customers within a 300 mile radius of its manufacturing plants. Strategically located existing plants give us an advantage over competitors from other areas, but we could be potentially disadvantaged by the relocation of a major customer.
Although metal containers face competition from plastic, paper, glass and composite containers, we believe that metal containers are superior to plastic, composite and paper containers in applications, where the contents are prepared at high temperatures or packaged in larger consumer or institutional quantities or where long-term storage of the product is desirable while maintaining the product’s quality. We also believe that metal containers are more desirable generally than glass containers because metal containers are more durable and less costly to transport. In addition, metal containers are one of the most recycled packages in the world and are infinitely recyclable. 
CLOSURES BUSINESS
Our closures business competes primarily with Albéa Beauty Holdings S.A., AptarGroup, Inc., Bericap Holding GmbH, Berry Global Group, Inc., Closures Systems International, Inc. (part of Rank Group Limited), Crown Holdings, Inc., Global Closure Systems, Groupe Massilly, Guala Dispensing Mexico, S.A. de C.V. and Tecnocap S.p.A. With our ability to manufacture an extensive range of metal and plastic closures and dispensing systems that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our closures product offering, and our geographic presence, we believe we are uniquely positioned to serve food, beverage, health care, garden, personal care, home and beauty product companies for their closure needs.
PLASTIC CONTAINER BUSINESS
Our plastic container business competes with a number of large national producers of plastic containers for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical products. These competitors include Alpha Packaging, Inc., Alpla-Werke Alwin Lehner GmbH & Co. KG, Amcor Limited, Berry Global Group, Inc., Cebal Americas, Consolidated Container Company LLC, Graham Packaging Company (part of Rank Group Limited) and Plastipak Holdings, Inc. In addition to our rapid response to our customers’ design, development and technology support needs and our value-added, diverse product line, we strive to remain current with and, to some extent, anticipate innovations in resin composition and applications and changes in the technology for the manufacturing of plastic containers and closures.
EMPLOYEES 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,200 salaried and 9,900 hourly employees on a full-time basis. Approximately 37 percent of our hourly plant employees in the United States and Canada as of that date were represented by a variety of unions, and most of our hourly employees in Europe, Asia, South America and Central America were represented by a variety of unions or other labor organizations. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, Campbell provided us with approximately 120 hourly employees on a full-time basis at one of the facilities that we lease from Campbell.
Our labor contracts expire at various times between 2019 and 2022. As of December 31, 2018, contracts covering approximately 12 percent of our hourly employees in the United States and Canada will expire during 2019. We expect no significant changes in our relations with these unions.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS
We are subject to federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations. In general, these laws and regulations limit the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. We believe that we are either in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable environmental laws and regulations or are operating in accordance with appropriate variances, schedules under compliance orders or similar arrangements.
In addition to costs associated with regulatory compliance, we may be held liable for alleged environmental damage associated with the past disposal of hazardous substances. Those that generate hazardous substances that are disposed of at sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and other classes of persons, are subject to claims for clean up and natural resource damages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. CERCLA and many similar state and foreign statutes may hold a responsible party liable for the entire cleanup cost at a particular site even though that party may not have caused the entire problem. Other state statutes may impose proportionate rather than joint and several liability. The federal Environmental Protection Agency or a state or foreign agency may also issue orders requiring responsible parties to undertake removal or remedial actions at sites.
We are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act and other federal, foreign, state and local laws regulating noise exposure levels and other safety and health concerns in the production areas of our plants.
While management does not believe that any of the regulatory matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial position or competitive position, we cannot assure you that a material environmental or other regulatory claim will not arise in the future.
RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Our research, product development and product engineering efforts relating to our metal container business are conducted at our research facilities in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Our research, product development and product engineering efforts relating to our closures business are conducted at our research facilities in Downers Grove, Illinois, Grandview, Missouri, Hannover, Germany and Waalwijk, Netherlands. Our research, product development and product engineering efforts with respect to our plastic container business are performed by our manufacturing and engineering personnel located at our plastic container manufacturing facilities. In addition to research, product development and product engineering, these sites also provide technical support to our customers. The amounts we have spent on research and development during the last three fiscal years are not material.
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, technological innovation, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property. We do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property portfolio is material to our business. We employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements and nondisclosure agreements, with third parties, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and know-how. However, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets and know-how through independent development or other means.
