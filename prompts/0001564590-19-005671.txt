Overview 
 We are
 a clinical-stage genetic medicines company committed to delivering life-changing treatments for people battling devastating diseases. Using PRISM, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform that enables the precise design, optimization and production of novel stereopure oligonucleotides, we aspire to develop best in class medicines across multiple therapeutic modalities. 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics, including oligonucleotides, are a growing and innovative class of drugs comprised of a sequence of nucleotides that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. We are initially developing oligonucleotides that target the ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) to either reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins. RNA is a critical molecule that can adopt complex three-dimensional structures and affect various cellular functions. By intervening at the RNA level, we have the potential to address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecules or biologics. Oligonucleotides have additional advantages as a therapeutic class including the ability to target multiple tissue types, often without the need for a delivery vehicle, and the ability to modulate the frequency of dosing to ensure broad distribution within tissues and account for cell turnover. Oligonucleotides also have well-established manufacturing processes and validated test methods based on decades of improvements.
 The oligonucleotides we are developing with PRISM are stereopure. A stereopure oligonucleotide is comprised of molecules with atoms precisely arranged in three-dimensional orientations at each linkage. We believe that controlling the position of the sulfur atom following phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification will optimize the pharmacological profile of our oligonucleotides by maximizing the potential therapeutic benefit while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks. The stereopure oligonucleotides we are developing differ from the mixture-based oligonucleotides currently on the market or in development by others. Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure oligonucleotides may achieve superior pharmacological properties compared with mixture-based oligonucleotides. Through our work in developing stereopure oligonucleotides, we have created and continue to evolve PRISM, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform. 
 PRISM enables us to target genetically defined diseases with stereopure oligonucleotides across multiple therapeutic modalities. PRISM combines our unique ability to construct stereopure oligonucleotides with a deep understanding of how the interplay among oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry impacts key pharmacological properties. By exploring these interactions through iterative analysis of in vitro and in vivo outcomes and artificial intelligence-driven predictive modeling, we continue to define design principles that we deploy across programs to rapidly develop and manufacture clinical candidates that meet pre-defined product profiles.
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize disease-modifying medicines for genetically defined diseases with a high degree of unmet medical need, and to become a fully integrated genetic medicines company. Our initial focus for our clinical development programs is in neurology, which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the neuromuscular system and central nervous system. We are conducting clinical trials of our lead program in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) targeting exon 51 and our two lead programs in Huntington’s disease (“HD”). We are advancing three additional development programs, targeting exon 53 in DMD and C9ORF72 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, and, subject to our submission of clinical trial applications and approval to proceed, we would expect topline clinical data readouts from these programs in the second half of 2020. In addition to neurology, we are advancing discovery research in ophthalmologic disorders, specifically inherited retinal diseases, and in hepatic diseases, and we expect to make continued investments in expanding the breadth of our portfolio. In further support of our pipeline, we continue to make substantial investments in, and leverage, PRISM to potentially develop the next generation of stereopure oligonucleotides. We have also established and continue to enhance our internal current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) manufacturing capabilities to increase control and visibility of our drug substance supply chain. These investments further improve our ability to secure drug substance for current and future development activities and may provide commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.

Our Current Programs
 

Additional details regarding our programs are set forth below.
 Neurology: Muscle
  
• | DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene that result in dysfunctional dystrophin protein. DMD impacts approximately one in every 5,000 newborn boys each year, resulting in approximately 20,000 new cases worldwide annually. In DMD, we are advancing suvodirsen (WVE-210201), which targets exon 51, a region within the precursor messenger RNA (“pre-mRNA”) that is transcribed from the dystrophin gene (also referred to as the “DMD” gene). In November 2017, we initiated a global, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of suvodirsen administered intravenously. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety and tolerability. The Phase 1 inclusion criteria allowed for participation by patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping, ages 5-18, ambulatory and non-ambulatory, as well as those previously treated with eteplirsen or ataluren following an appropriate washout period. On December 6, 2018, we announced that the safety and tolerability data from the Phase 1 trial support initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of suvodirsen and that we selected a dose for the Phase 2/3 trial. We plan to present the results from the Phase 1 trial, as well as details of the Phase 2/3 trial design, at upcoming scientific meetings. As patients complete the Phase 1 trial, they have the option to enroll in an ongoing open label extension study (“OLE”) in which they continue to receive suvodirsen. The OLE is expected to enroll up to 40 patients who previously participated in the Phase 1 trial. Patients in the OLE are undergoing quarterly clinical assessments using validated clinical outcome measures and are having muscle biopsies taken so that an interim analysis may be conducted by measuring dystrophin expression using a standardized Western blot. Data from this interim analysis are intended to be an important component of a submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for accelerated approval of suvodirsen in the United States, and we remain on track to deliver these data in the second half of 2019. We anticipate initiating the global, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 efficacy and safety clinical trial of suvodirsen in 2019. The Phase 2/3 trial is designed to measure clinical efficacy and dystrophin expression, and we intend to use the results of this trial to seek regulatory approvals globally. On January 3, 2019, we announced that the Phase 2/3 trial of suvodirsen had been selected for the FDA pilot program for complex innovative trial designs (“CID pilot program”). In evaluating submissions for the CID pilot program, the FDA considered two key criteria: the innovative features of the Phase 2/3 trial design and the therapeutic need (i.e., therapeutics being developed for use in disease areas where there are limited or no treatment options). Through the CID pilot program, we intend to reduce the number of patients required to deliver conclusive clinical efficacy results, thereby minimizing the number of patients required in the placebo treatment arm and potentially accelerating completion of the trial. This marks the first time that the FDA has selected clinical protocols for its CID pilot program that was announced in August 2018.

• | Our second development program in DMD, WVE-N531, targets exon 53. Subject to our submission of clinical trial applications and approval to proceed, we would expect to deliver topline clinical data for WVE-N531 in the second half of 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Also in DMD, we are exploring programs targeting DMD exons 44, 45, 52, 54 and 55 and investigating alternative forms of delivery, including subcutaneous administration, for our existing and future DMD programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In addition to DMD, we are conducting research to identify potential targets for other neuromuscular diseases where PRISM, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform may be most effective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neurology: Central Nervous System (“CNS”)
  
• | In HD, we are advancing two programs, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, each targeting a disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”) within the huntingtin gene (“HTT”): rs362307 (“HTT SNP1”) and rs362331 (“HTT SNP2”), respectively. Targeting mRNA transcript with these SNPs allows us to lower the mutant allele transcript, while leaving the healthy transcript relatively intact. We commonly refer to this method (or approach) as “allele specific targeting.” SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is associated with the expression of a disease-causing protein. We have shown that by targeting HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2 in preclinical in vitro studies, the production of disease-causing proteins associated with HD can be reduced. As part of ongoing, required and routine toxicology support of our clinical programs, we continue to conduct in vivo nonclinical toxicology studies for WVE-120101 and WVE-120102. A recent in vivo micronucleus assay yielded results that require additional nonclinical studies that we are planning to conduct. In July 2017, we initiated PRECISION-HD, a global clinical program consisting of the PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 clinical trials. PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 are two parallel, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trials evaluating WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, administered intrathecally, consisting of single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose portions. The primary objective of these two trials is to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecal doses of WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, in early manifest HD patients. Additional objectives include measurement of total HTT protein and mutant HTT protein, and exploratory pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical and MRI endpoints. Each trial is expected to enroll approximately 50 Stage I or Stage II HD patients, ages 25-65, who have screened positively for the presence of SNP1 or SNP2. Outside of the United States, we are enrolling patients in both the single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose portions of the PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 trials. In the United States, we received approvals to proceed with the single-dose portions of both trials. However, the FDA indicated to us that we cannot progress to the multiple-ascending dose portions of these trials in the United States unless we conduct an additional preclinical study and present the resulting data to the FDA for its review. For the single-dose portion of the PRECISION-HD1 trial in the United States, escalation to our highest proposed doses is subject to the FDA’s review and approval of additional monitoring plans. We expect to deliver topline clinical data from the PRECISION-HD trials in the first half of 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”), we are advancing WVE-3972-01, which preferentially targets the transcript containing the GGGGCC (“G4C2”) expansion in the C9ORF72 gene. WVE-3972-01 is designed to minimize the impact on normal C9ORF72 protein in patients, thereby reducing potential on-target risk. The G4C2 expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD and is a strong genetic risk factor for non-inherited (sporadic) forms of ALS and FTD. Subject to our submission of clinical trial applications and approval to proceed, we would expect to deliver topline clinical data for WVE-3972-01 in the second half of 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (“SCA3”), we are advancing a lead candidate targeting ATXN3. SCA3 is a rare, hereditary (autosomal dominant), progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) to advance genetically defined targets for the treatment of other CNS disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we may collaborate with Takeda on up to six preclinical programs at any one time, during a four-year term. Takeda is entitled to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs from us during the term.

Ophthalmology
  
• | We are designing and advancing stereopure oligonucleotides for the potential treatment of rare, inherited eye diseases. Our research is assessing four inherited retinal diseases, which typically begin in childhood or adolescence and commonly lead to progressive vision loss: retinitis pigmentosa due to a P23H mutation in the RHO gene, Stargardt disease, Usher syndrome type 2A and Leber congenital amaurosis 10. Our preclinical data demonstrate that a single intravitreal injection of stereopure oligonucleotide in the eye of non-human primates resulted in greater than 95% knockdown of a target RNA in the retina for at least four months. Based on these data, we are working to design candidates that could achieve a therapeutic effect with only two doses per year. We expect to announce our first ophthalmology candidate in the second half of 2019.

Hepatic
  
• | We are collaborating with Pfizer to advance genetically defined targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, bringing together our proprietary drug development platform across antisense and single-stranded RNAi modalities, along with GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology for delivery to the liver. Pfizer has selected five targets, including Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), which is the maximum number of targets that Pfizer may select under the terms of the agreement. We will advance five targets from discovery through the selection of clinical candidates, at which point Pfizer may elect to exclusively license the programs and undertake further development and potential commercialization.

Our Strategy 
 We are building a fully integrated genetic medicines company by leveraging PRISM to design, develop and commercialize optimized disease-modifying medicines for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. Our initial programs are focused in neurology and are aimed at addressing DMD, HD, ALS, FTD and SCA3. In parallel to our neurology programs, we are advancing preclinical programs in ophthalmology and hepatic diseases as well as exploring additional therapeutic areas that may benefit from the application of our platform. 
 The key components of our strategy are as follows: 
  
• | Maintain and extend our leadership in oligonucleotides. We intend to establish a dominant position in the field of oligonucleotides, advancing basic research and pharmacology using stereochemistry across multiple therapeutic modalities and target classes. Through PRISM, our efforts continue to reveal structure-activity relationships among sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry that may allow us to tune the activity of our oligonucleotides in a previously unexplored modality-specific manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our clinical development programs. We are advancing three programs currently in clinical development: suvodirsen targeting exon 51 in DMD and WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, targeting HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2, respectively, in HD. We expect to deliver topline data from our two Phase 1b/2a trials in HD in the first half of 2019. In DMD, we expect to deliver an interim analysis of dystrophin expression from the OLE for suvodirsen in the second half of 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustain our leadership in neurology. We are committed to transforming the care of rare genetic diseases in neurology, which we broadly define as the neuromuscular system and the CNS. Our current neurology development programs offer a foundation from which to transform our company into a fully integrated commercial organization. We also believe there are additional areas within neurology, specifically neurodegenerative movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases beyond DMD and neurodegenerative dementias, that we can uniquely address with PRISM to reach underserved patient populations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our pipeline. We remain intent on making disciplined investments in our platform to enable a sustainable discovery and development engine for future growth. We believe PRISM will yield optimized oligonucleotide candidates to deepen our pipeline in neurologic and hepatic diseases, as well as to allow us to broaden our pipeline into additional therapeutic areas, such as ophthalmology, where our initial focus is in rare, inherited retinal diseases. We will continue to pursue these investments through wholly-owned programs as well as through potential partnerships and collaborations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage manufacturing leadership in stereopure oligonucleotides. We have built a hybrid internal / external manufacturing model that gives us the capability to produce stereopure oligonucleotides at scales from one micromole to potential commercial scale. We believe that leveraging our internal manufacturing capabilities based in our Lexington, Massachusetts facility along with expertise from established Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”) facilitates our growth and enhances our ability to secure drug substance for current and future development activities.

Oligonucleotides 
 The majority of traditional therapeutics, such as small molecules and biologics, work by interacting with proteins that contribute to the disease. However, there are thought to be a limited number of “druggable” proteins; it is currently estimated that approximately 80% of human protein targets cannot be addressed by these conventional approaches. In contrast, we believe that directing medicines to the RNA, which is critical to the production of proteins, rather than to the proteins themselves, has the potential to significantly increase the number of druggable targets. We also believe that utilizing and building upon the established scientific, regulatory, operational and commercial knowledge base with regard to genetic medicines that target RNA gives us the best chance of success to rapidly deliver therapies to the patients who need them. 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics, including oligonucleotides, are an innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target RNAs to ultimately affect the production of disease-associated proteins or prevent the accumulation of pathogenic RNA species, which are emerging as important factors in human disease. Oligonucleotides can regulate protein and RNA via several different molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized as silencing, those that promote degradation of the target RNA, including antisense and RNAi; splicing, those that involve binding to the target RNA and modulating its function by promoting exon skipping; and RNA-guided gene editing. 
 The unique capability of oligonucleotides to address a wide range of genomic targets that impact multiple therapeutic areas creates potentially significant market opportunities for us to develop molecules to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases, including diseases where no medicines currently exist or for which existing treatments are not optimal. 
 The oligonucleotides we are currently developing employ the following molecular mechanisms: 
  
• | Antisense, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific sequence in a target RNA strand that encodes a disease-associated protein or pathogenic RNA. The resulting two-stranded molecule (“duplex”) is then recognized by a cellular enzyme called RNase H, which cleaves, or cuts, the target RNA in the duplex, thereby preventing the disease-associated protein from being made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RNA interference (“RNAi”), which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to recognize a specific sequence and engages RNAi machinery known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (“RISC”) to silence a target RNA that is either pathogenic itself or encodes a disease-associated protein, thereby preventing the accumulation of the pathogenic species (RNA or protein).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Splicing, which is the processing of a nascent pre-mRNA transcript into messenger RNA (“mRNA”) by removing introns and joining exons together.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exon skipping, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a particular sequence within a target pre-mRNA and direct the cellular machinery to delete, or splice out, certain specific regions of that RNA. Often, the underlying mutation in the target RNA leads to a “stop” instruction, so that, absent the therapeutic oligonucleotide, non-productive mRNA yields no functional protein. Use of the exon-skipping modality permits the cellular machinery to correct the “stop” instruction and assemble a partially functional protein, thereby mitigating or alleviating the disease that would otherwise result.

Design of Oligonucleotides 
 Oligonucleotides are largely comprised of chemically modified, short-length RNA or deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) strands, commonly known as oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA and DNA—that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. In nucleic acid molecules that have not been modified for therapeutic use, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester (“PO”) bonds, as shown below. 
 

Such unmodified nucleic acid molecules are unsuitable for use as therapeutics because they are rapidly degraded by enzymes called nucleases that are widely distributed in the human body, are rapidly cleared by the kidneys and are taken up poorly by targeted cells. The industry has employed chemical modifications of the nucleotides and PO bonds that improve the stability, biodistribution and cellular uptake of oligonucleotides. 
 The phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification was one of the earliest and remains one of the most common backbone modifications used in oligonucleotides. When introducing a PS modification, one of the nonbridging oxygen (O) atoms bonded to a phosphorus (P) atom is replaced with a sulfur (S) atom. This modification improves the stability of oligonucleotides by making them less susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Further, PS bond-containing oligonucleotides increase binding to plasma proteins, which improves biodistribution by preventing rapid renal excretion of these molecules. 
 Whereas traditional chemistry platforms for oligonucleotides require the full replacement of the naturally occurring PO with PS, we can judiciously use a combination of PO and PS in our stereopure nucleic acids. We believe this flexibility to selectively employ PS modifications only where desired may provide control over pharmacodynamics and may improve the safety of our product candidates. 
 The first FDA approval of a nucleic acid therapeutic occurred in 1998, and the most recent was in 2018. Nucleic acid therapeutic candidates that employ PS modifications are being developed by several different companies. PS modification is accepted as a state-of-the-art advancement in the field. We believe that PS modification will remain a key component of nucleic acid therapeutic development. 
 PS Modification Results in Complex Drug Mixtures 
 A consequence of introducing PS modifications into an oligonucleotide is that it also introduces a chiral center at each phosphorus, creating stereoisomers designated as either an “Sp” or “Rp” isomer. As shown below, these stereoisomers have identical chemical compositions but different three-dimensional arrangements of their atoms and consequently different chemical and biological properties. 
 
8


The isomeric configuration at each PS modification is random (either Rp or Sp) during conventional nucleic acid therapeutic synthesis. Because oligonucleotides contain a string of nucleotides with associated PS modifications, the synthesis process generates a complex mixture containing many stereoisomers. Specifically, each PS linkage doubles the number of stereoisomers in the product, so that a conventional preparation of a PS-containing oligonucleotide contains 2N stereoisomers, where N represents the number of PS modifications. As shown below, a conventional, fully PS-modified oligonucleotide (20 nucleotides in length, 19 PS modifications) is a mixture of over 500,000 stereoisomers, each having the same nucleotide sequence but differing in the stereochemistry along their backbones. 
 

Stereoisomers can possess different chemical and pharmacological properties. For example, certain stereoisomers can drive the therapeutic effects of a drug while others can be less beneficial or can even contribute to undesirable side effects. The greater the variation among a drug’s constituent stereoisomers, the greater the potential to diminish the drug’s efficacy and safety. 
 Prior to the development of our technology, it was not possible to create stereopure PS-modified oligonucleotides, meaning molecules where the configuration of each chiral PS linkage is precisely controlled during chemical synthesis. Moreover, because of the sheer number of stereoisomers present in a mixture, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to physically isolate the most therapeutically optimal stereoisomer from within a mixture. For these reasons, all PS-modified oligonucleotides currently on the market and in development by others are mixtures of many stereoisomers, which we believe are not optimized for stability, catalytic activity, efficacy or toxicity. 
 In small molecule therapeutics, U.S. regulators have long sought to eliminate the risks potentially posed by drug mixtures containing multiple stereoisomers. Since 1992, the FDA has recommended full molecular characterization of stereoisomers within small-molecule drug mixtures. Historically, it has not been possible to achieve such characterization for nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures, which can contain tens of thousands to millions of distinct pharmacological entities. Based on our published and ongoing preclinical studies, we believe that we can design and synthesize stereopure PS-modified oligonucleotides that demonstrate superior pharmacological properties compared with mixture-based oligonucleotides. We believe that PRISM has the potential to set a new industry standard for the molecular characterization of complex nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures. 
 Our Solution: PRISM 
 We have developed proprietary chemistry that enables the development of novel PO/PS-modified oligonucleotides in which stereochemistry is precisely controlled. This degree of control enables us to both rationally design and synthesize optimized stereopure oligonucleotides. We have published both our proprietary chemistry platform and its application to synthesize stereopure oligonucleotides in Nature Biotechnology (Iwamoto N, et al. Nature Biotechnol. 2017;35(9):845-851). 
 Through PRISM, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform, we have discovered and expect to continuously elaborate on the relationships between the chemical makeup of an oligonucleotide, including the three-dimensional orientation or arrangement of its atoms, and its pharmacology (i.e., stability of the drug, activity against the target, specificity for the target and immunogenicity of the drug). Our initial findings relating the stereochemical make up of oligonucleotides to their pharmacology were also featured in our Nature Biotechnology publication. In addition, we have defined relationships between various 2’-sugar modifications to the nucleotide (such as methoxy, methoxyethyl, fluoro, locked), and the stereochemistry of the backbone that enhances oligonucleotide pharmacology, providing an enhanced therapeutic profile. 
 9

Our rational process for designing stereopure oligonucleotides, which is based on the interplay among oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry, allows us to selectively optimize for the molecular mechanism in order to generate best-in-class oligonucleotides. We are using these ongoing discoveries to guide our drug development activities that we believe will lead to medicines that can be dosed at lower concentrations, less frequently, or both, as well as with improved therapeutic profiles.
 Advantages of Our Approach 
 We believe that PRISM is a significant advancement in the development of oligonucleotides. The advantages of our approach include: 
  
• | Ability to rationally design product candidates with optimized pharmacological properties. PRISM, our proprietary discovery and drug development platform, enables us to target genetically defined diseases with stereopure oligonucleotides across multiple therapeutic modalities. PRISM combines our unique ability to construct stereopure oligonucleotides with a deep understanding of how the interplay among oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry impacts key pharmacological properties. By exploring these interactions through iterative analysis of in vitro and in vivo outcomes and artificial intelligence-driven predictive modeling, we continue to define design principles that we deploy across programs to rapidly develop and manufacture clinical candidates that meet pre-defined product profiles.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applicability. PRISM is applicable to oligonucleotides acting via multiple molecular mechanisms, including antisense, RNAi, exon skipping, splicing, RNA-guided gene editing, microRNA and others, and is compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications and targeting moieties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary production of stereopure oligonucleotides. Our scientists have developed expertise in the techniques required to produce adequate supplies of PS-modified, stereopure oligonucleotide materials for our preclinical and planned clinical activities. In addition, we believe we have the intellectual property position and know-how necessary to protect, advance and scale these production processes to support our clinical trials and potential future commercial supply.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability and Manufacturing. Our manufacturing process and technical expertise in designing stereopure oligonucleotides is unique. We believe that our scalable synthesis processes will allow us to meet demand for cGMP-qualified clinical trial supply, as well as the potential for commercial manufacturing at a cost of goods and potential cost-per-patient that are comparable to stereorandom oligonucleotides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proprietary Chemistry – Proof of Concept 
 In preclinical models, which we believe are predictive of human biology, we have demonstrated that stereochemistry and pharmacology are directly related, and that these relationships inform the rational design and production of oligonucleotides. In proof-of-concept studies, we have used PRISM to design and synthesize diverse sets of oligonucleotides, which allowed us to characterize and compare the behavior of various stereoisomers. These preclinical studies, some of which have been published in Nature Biotechnology, have demonstrated that by controlling stereochemistry, we can optimize multiple aspects of pharmacology, including stability, catalytic activity, efficacy, specificity, immunogenicity, enhanced delivery, and broad tissue distribution, which in turn, we believe will lead to an enhanced therapeutic profile. As with any drug under development, we cannot be certain that the same favorable pharmacological properties we have observed in preclinical studies for our stereopure oligonucleotides will translate to humans. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Discovery, Manufacturing, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates” for a discussion of the risks associated with the development of pharmaceuticals, and oligonucleotides in particular. 
 In our Nature Biotechnology paper, we describe our studies using stereopure oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide mixtures based on mipomersen. We studied mipomersen because, at that time, it was the only systemically administered nucleic acid therapeutic approved for commercialization, and documents from the regulatory bodies that evaluated mipomersen for marketing approval were publicly available. Mipomersen (currently marketed by Kastle Therapeutics and formerly marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, under the brand name Kynamro) is approved for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and is designed to silence production of Apolipoprotein B (“APOB”) via an antisense mechanism. Although mipomersen received marketing authorization in the United States in 2012, concerns about the drug’s tolerability and liver and cardiovascular safety led the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) to refuse to grant marketing authorization for the drug in the European Union. One of the EMA’s central concerns about mipomersen was that a high proportion of patients stopped taking the drug within two years, mainly due to side effects such as flu-like symptoms, injection-site reactions and liver toxicity. The EMA considered these side effects important because mipomersen is intended for long-term treatment to maintain its cholesterol-lowering effect. 
 Mipomersen, an oligonucleotide containing 20 nucleotides and 19 PS modifications, is synthesized by traditional oligonucleotide chemistry; thus, it is actually a mixture of over 500,000 different stereoisomers (219 = 524,288). We rationally designed and synthesized individual stereoisomers of mipomersen, each having position-specific and distinct stereochemistry, and conducted studies comparing these defined stereoisomers with the mipomersen stereomixture.

 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and stability by exposing our panel of individual stereoisomers and the stereomixture to metabolic enzymes, including nucleases, in rat liver homogenate or rat serum. We incubated each stereoisomer or the stereomixture separately in rat whole-liver homogenate for five days at physiological temperature and measured the percentage of each full-length stereoisomer and the stereomixture remaining daily. We found that stereochemistry had a profound impact on oligonucleotide stability. 
 As shown in the graph below, by day five, less than 15% of the stereomixture (mipomersen) remained. By contrast at day five, over 50% of our stereopure isomers 1, 2, 3 and 4 remained, with isomer 1 showing minimal degradation, indicating that these individual stereopure isomers have greater stability than the stereomixture. The mipomersen stereomixture, however, was more stable than several other stereoisomers (i.e., 5, 6 and 7).
 

We obtained similar results when we assessed the stability of the stereomixture and selected stereoisomers in rat serum. Overall, we found that increasing the proportion of Sp isomers increased the stability of the oligonucleotides.
 Catalytic Activity 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and catalytic activity, which, in the case of the antisense modality, is a measure of the efficiency with which the drug leads to the knockdown of the target. In the human body, antisense drugs like mipomersen rely on the enzyme RNase H to degrade or knockdown the target mRNA. Yielding efficient RNase H catalytic activity is an essential pharmacological feature for drugs like mipomersen. 
 We evaluated the catalytic activity of the same panel of stereoisomers described above in in vitro enzymatic assays using human RNase H. We added RNase H to pre-formed duplexes containing the stereoisomers or the stereomixture bound to the target APOB mRNA, and we assessed the relative rates of target RNA degradation. To do this, we stopped the reactions at designated time points and quantified the amount of full-length APOB mRNA remaining. 
 11

As shown below, the catalytic activity of the stereoisomers and the stereomixture differed considerably, as demonstrated by their efficiency in reducing the amount of the full-length target remaining over time. Certain stereoisomers, most notably stereoisomer 4, was far more catalytically active than the stereomixture as well as other stereoisomers. Importantly, stereoisomer 4 contains a pattern of PS stereochemistry denoted 3’-SpSpRp-5’ (“SSR”). We also identified stereoisomers with distinct patterns of PS stereochemistry that were less catalytically active than the stereomixture, most notably isomer 7. 
 

Based on these and other data, we have established key design principles (i.e., the SSR motif) relating stereochemistry to RNase H catalytic activity. These principles can now be applied across antisense therapeutics and are compatible with a broad range of additional chemical modifications to the drug molecule.
 Based on these studies and others, we believe we can synthesize stereopure oligonucleotides that possesses increased stability and catalytic activity, independent of nucleotide sequence. 
 Efficacy
 We assessed whether improved stability and catalytic activity of our stereoisomers would translate into greater efficacy in an in vivo pharmacological study. We administered our panel of stereoisomers and the stereomixture to transgenic mice that express human APOB. This validated animal model was included in the preclinical package used for the regulatory approval of mipomersen in the United States. 
 We injected mice twice weekly with 10 mg/kg of stereoisomer 3, stereoisomer 5, or the stereomixture over a four-week period. We measured APOB protein levels in the serum weekly for six weeks. This treatment protocol and study design replicates the preclinical in vivo pharmacology study that was included in the regulatory submission for mipomersen. 
 12

In the experiment, stereoisomer 3, which demonstrated increased catalytic activity and stability in vitro compared with the stereomixture and stereoisomer 5, led to greater reduction in serum APOB protein than either the stereomixture or stereoisomer 5. These data are illustrated in the graph below, where levels of APOB in serum, expressed as a percentage of APOB at baseline, is plotted with respect to time (days). Knockdown of APOB by the stereomixture (mipomersen) and stereoisomer 5 decreased dramatically following final dose (after day 28). In contrast, stereoisomer 3 demonstrated efficient and sustained target engagement, as evidenced by the magnitude and duration of knockdown, which persisted for over two weeks after the final dose.
 

Specificity 
 By controlling stereochemistry, we have discovered that we can change the pattern of RNase H cleavage in the target mRNA that is caused by PS-modified antisense. Indeed, we can use stereochemistry to direct cleavage toward specific positions within the target. This precision control enables us to design PS-modified nucleic acids that can direct RNase H to differentiate between two very similar targets. This level of specificity is desirable in cases where cleavage of one target is expected to have disease-modifying impacts, but cleavage of a closely related target is undesirable or potentially unsafe. 
 For example, HD is caused by mutations in one allele (which is one of two or more versions of a gene) of the HTT gene, resulting in the production of a disease-causing protein, while the other allele encodes a healthy protein. By optimizing stereochemistry, we can direct cleavage towards the mutated HTT allele based on a single-nucleotide difference between the disease-causing allele and the normal allele. 
 13

In the experiment illustrated below, we performed in vitro RNase H enzymatic reactions similar to those presented previously. As before, we added RNase H to stereopure oligonucleotides or stereorandom oligonucleotides that were duplexed with mutant or healthy HTT RNA. We stopped the reactions at designated time points and quantified the amount of full-length mutant or healthy HTT RNA remaining. The stereorandom oligonucleotide (left panel) caused substantial reductions in both the mutant and healthy HTT RNA, whereas the optimized stereopure oligonucleotide (right panel) preferentially cleaved mutant HTT RNA while largely sparing the healthy HTT RNA. 
 

We believe that our ability to use stereochemistry to precisely control the RNase H cleavage patterns resulting from PS-modified nucleic acids allows us to mitigate unwanted activity in vivo. This affords us a unique position to make allele-specific targeting (meaning the preferential interaction of an oligonucleotide with RNA transcribed from only one allele of a given gene) possible. 
 Through these preclinical studies, we have demonstrated the ability to use stereochemistry to precisely control cleavage and reduce off-target cleavage. We believe these findings can be applied in the design of nucleic acid therapies for a range of disease targets. 
 Immunogenicity 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and immunogenicity, which is the ability of a substance to activate an immune response. Immune activation has been observed with PS-modified oligonucleotides in preclinical toxicology studies. Flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions in clinical studies are believed to be immune mediated. 
 Using NHP serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to our panel of individual stereopure isomers and the parent stereomixture. We incubated each isomer and stereomixture at physiological temperature in NHP serum from three individual animals. We removed samples from these incubations at designated times, and we assessed complement activation by measuring the increase in the amount of protein C3a. Protein C3a is formed when the complement system is activated and complement component 3 is cleaved. C3a levels in serum increase in direct proportion to the amount of pathway activation. We quantified serum C3a levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”) analytical method, a technique used to determine the amount of a specific protein present in a biological sample. 
 14

As shown below, the stereoisomers and the stereomixture yielded different levels of complement pathway activation as measured by C3a production. Certain stereoisomers, such as stereoisomers 1 and 2, showed less than half of the C3a production compared with the stereomixture (shown in black). 
 

We have also assayed immune activation of stereoisomers and the parent stereomixture in a human TLR9 reporter assay (left panel below) and a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (“PBMC”) cytokine panel (right panel below, IL-6 and MIP-1β are key cytokines in B-cell and macrophage activation, respectively). In the TLR9 assay, the 5’methylcytosine (“5mC”)-modified stereomixture activated TLR9 activity, whereas our stereopure isomer did not. Similarly, the 5mC-modified stereomixture (Isomer-1) led to IL-6 and MIP-1β secretion from PBMCs, where our stereopure isomer (Isomer-2) did not. Prior research has indicated that 5mC and 2’-modifications to a nucleic acid therapeutic containing the immune-activating CpG motif are sufficient to limit immune activation. However, substantial immune activation persists even when these modifications are incorporated, as seen in these experiments. PRISM allows us to design stereoisomers that yield notably less activation of the immune system.


Based on these studies, we believe that it is possible to modulate complement activation and potentially reduce the immunogenicity of PS-modified oligonucleotides by controlling stereochemistry.
 

Enhanced Delivery
 We have also investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and cellular uptake, which is the ability of oligonucleotides to penetrate cells and access the appropriate subcellular compartment (i.e., the nucleus) for them to engage with their intended target. Designing oligonucleotides that enter cells at sufficient concentrations to provide a therapeutic effect has been a challenge for the oligonucleotides field.
 15

As shown below, we performed an intracellular trafficking assay using differentiating myoblast cell lines to compare the cellular localization of stereopure and stereorandom oligonucleotides in vitro. We washed and fixed treated cells and detected the oligonucleotides using a ViewRNA assay and an immunofluorescence microscope with deconvolution capabilities. Z-stacks were taken to eliminate artifacts. We compared the number of oligonucleotide foci (red, left panel below) in the nucleus (blue) of cultured cells that we treated with either a stereorandom oligonucleotide or one of our stereopure oligonucleotides. We detected substantially more foci per nucleus for our stereopure oligonucleotide compared with a stereorandom oligonucleotide of comparable sequence (right panel below).


Broad Tissue Distribution
 Using PRISM, we are able to design oligonucleotides that do not need delivery vehicles, such as conjugates or viral vectors, to reach many tissues. Our oligonucleotides can be delivered via multiple routes of administration and distributed to multiple tissues at levels sufficient to potently impact the expression of a target gene (e.g., MALAT1). As shown below, we achieved broad tissue distribution in CNS, eye and muscle tissue in mice with no delivery vehicle.
 

CNS and eye tissues were harvested 1-week post-dose. Muscle tissue was collected 3-days post-dose. All tissues were processed, and mRNA was quantified by qPCR. Plots show percentage of mRNA remaining (Malat1) with respect to control mRNA (Hprt). For CNS and muscle, each symbol represents one animal; for eye, each symbol represents one eye. SR: Stereorandom, ICV: intracerebroventricular, IVT: intravitreal, SC: subcutaneous.
 
16

In the CNS, we observe broad distribution of naked (unconjugated) oligonucleotides in mice after a single intracerebroventricular injection. Our oligonucleotides in clinical trials and in development for CNS programs are delivered by intrathecal injection.


Mice received a single 100 ug ICV injection of unconjugated, stereopure ASO targeting MALAT1. 10-weeks post-dose, CNS tissues were processed, and mRNA was quantified by qPCR. Plots show percentage of mRNA remaining (Malat1) with respect to control mRNA (Hprt). Each symbol represents one animal. Ctx: cortex, Str: striatum, Cb: cerebellum, Hp: hippocampus, SC: spinal cord, ICV: intracerebroventricular.
 
As we have expanded our investigations into the impact that stereochemistry has on the pharmacological properties of oligonucleotides, we have deployed the same patterns of backbone stereochemistry in the context of new and more diverse sequences and in the presence of distinct chemical modifications to the nucleoside. In these investigations, we have discovered an interplay between oligonucleotide sequence, chemistry and backbone stereochemistry: the impact that a particular pattern of backbone stereochemistry has on any one pharmacological property of an oligonucleotide can be augmented or curtailed by the oligonucleotide sequence or the accompanying chemical modifications. Our discovery efforts continuously elaborate on these relationships and have already revealed design rules that expedite the development of new candidates based on modality. The discovery of this interplay and delineation of design rules affords us an important advantage: to generate oligonucleotides that meet our desired product profiles, we can modulate a new and critical dimension of oligonucleotide therapeutics through the control of backbone stereochemistry, and we can modulate the sequence and chemistry. In certain situations, for example, when targeting a sequence containing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the ability to modulate the target sequence can be limited. In these circumstances, our ability to control both backbone stereochemistry and chemistry increases the likelihood that we can develop a candidate that matches our desired product profile.
 Our Initial Therapeutic Programs
 Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in neurology, which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the neuromuscular system and CNS. Within neurology, we are focused on DMD, HD, ALS, FTD and SCA3. We have initiated clinical trials of suvodirsen, our lead program in DMD targeting exon 51, and our two lead programs in HD. We are advancing several other programs, including WVE-N531 targeting exon 53 in DMD, WVE-3972-01 targeting C9ORF72 in ALS and FTD and a program targeting ATXN3 in SCA3. We are also conducting preclinical research to develop a lead candidate in ophthalmology and continue to explore additional targets in CNS, neuromuscular and hepatic disorders.
 17

See below for more information on these programs and the diseases we are targeting. 
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 DMD is a rare, genetic progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene on the X chromosome that affects approximately one in 5,000 newborn boys around the world (approximately 20,000 new cases annually). The dystrophin protein is part of a protein complex called the dystrophin-associated protein complex that acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell’s structural framework with a lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell through the muscle cell membrane. The dystrophin-associated protein complex protects the muscle from injury during contraction and relaxation. Patients with DMD typically develop muscle weakness in the early years of life and become wheelchair-bound in their early teens. As the disease progresses, DMD patients typically develop respiratory, orthopedic and cardiac complications. Cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties usually begin by the age of 20, and few individuals with DMD live beyond their thirties. 
Current Treatments 
 While there are approved therapies for DMD, there is no cure, and there continues to be significant unmet medical need. In most countries, corticosteroids are the standard drug therapy, which slows the progression of muscle weakness and delays loss of ambulation by two to three years. In February 2017, the FDA approved Emflaza (deflazacort), the first corticosteroid approved as a treatment in the United States for DMD patients older than five years of age. 
 In 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51™ (eteplirsen) received accelerated approval in the United States. The FDA concluded that the data submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to confer clinical benefit in some patients with DMD, who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. According to U.S. accelerated approval guidelines, no clinical benefit needs to be established at the time of FDA approval, and no clinical benefit of eteplirsen has yet been established. Thus, consistent with the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, eteplirsen is being evaluated in a post-marketing approval clinical trial to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. The required clinical trial is designed to assess whether eteplirsen improves motor function of DMD patients, who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. Another exon-skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD, BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s drisapersen, received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA in January 2016, indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the application was not ready for approval in its present form. 
 In 2014, PTC Therapeutics’ Translarna™ (ataluren) was the first disease-modifying treatment to receive conditional approval by the EMA for the treatment of ambulatory DMD patients over 5 years of age who have a nonsense mutation (12% of DMD cases) in the DMD gene. In 2016, the EMA did not allow ataluren to convert to full marketing authorization, rather it granted a renewal of the conditional approval. In 2018, EMA expanded the conditional approval for Translarna to include treatment of ambulatory DMD patients ≤2 years of age who have a nonsense mutation in the DMD gene.
 Our Programs 
 In DMD, we are advancing suvodirsen (WVE-210201), which targets exon 51, a region within the precursor messenger RNA (“pre-mRNA”) that is transcribed from the dystrophin gene (also referred to as the “DMD” gene). In November 2017, we initiated a global, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of suvodirsen administered intravenously. The primary endpoint of the trial was safety and tolerability. The Phase 1 inclusion criteria allowed for participation by patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping, ages 5-18, ambulatory and non-ambulatory, as well as those previously treated with eteplirsen or ataluren following an appropriate washout period. On December 6, 2018, we announced that the safety and tolerability data from the Phase 1 trial support initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of suvodirsen and that we selected a dose for the Phase 2/3 trial. We plan to present the results from the Phase 1 trial, as well as details of the Phase 2/3 trial design, at upcoming scientific meetings. As patients complete the Phase 1 trial, they have the option to enroll in an ongoing open label extension study (“OLE”) in which they continue to receive suvodirsen. The OLE is expected to enroll up to 40 patients who previously participated in the Phase 1 trial. Patients in the OLE are undergoing quarterly clinical assessments using validated clinical outcome measures and are having muscle biopsies taken so that an interim analysis may be conducted by measuring dystrophin expression using a standardized Western blot. Data from this interim analysis are intended to be an important component of a submission to the FDA for accelerated approval of suvodirsen in the United States, and we remain on track to deliver these data in the second half of 2019. Suvodirsen has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of DMD by the FDA and the European Commission, as well as rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA. We anticipate initiating the global, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 efficacy and safety clinical trial of suvodirsen in 2019. The Phase 2/3 trial is designed to measure clinical efficacy and dystrophin expression, and we intend to use the results of this trial to seek regulatory approvals globally. On January 3, 2019, we announced that the Phase 2/3 trial of suvodirsen had been selected for the FDA pilot program for complex innovative trial designs (“CID pilot program”). In evaluating submissions for the CID pilot program, the FDA considered two key criteria: the innovative features of the Phase 2/3 trial design and the therapeutic need (i.e., therapeutics being developed for use in disease areas where there are limited or no treatment options). Through the CID pilot program, we intend to reduce the number of patients required to deliver conclusive clinical efficacy results, thereby minimizing the number of patients required in the placebo treatment arm and potentially accelerating completion of the trial. This marks the first time that the FDA has selected clinical protocols for its CID pilot program that was announced in August 2018.

Our second development program in DMD, WVE-N531, targets exon 53. Subject to our submission of clinical trial applications and approval to proceed, we would expect to deliver topline clinical data for WVE-N531 in the second half of 2020.
 Also in DMD, we are exploring programs targeting DMD exons 44, 45, 52, 54 and 55 and investigating alternative forms of delivery, including subcutaneous administration, for our existing and future DMD programs.
 Exon 51
 Suvodirsen was selected for clinical development, in part, based on its ability to demonstrate high exon 51 skipping efficiency and dystrophin protein restoration in patient-derived muscle cells. Efficiency at skipping exon 51 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR following exposure to equal concentrations of oligonucleotides. As shown below, suvodirsen demonstrated dose-dependent and more potent increases in exon skipping efficiency compared with analogs of eteplirsen and drisapersen. 
 

Using patient-derived muscle cells, we analyzed suvodirsen’s impact on protein expression by Western blot after gymnotic uptake, meaning delivery of drug candidate to the cell in the absence of any carriers or conjugation. Results show that suvodirsen induced a clear dose-dependent restoration of dystrophin protein expression (Western blot shown below). 
 

19

At a 10 µM concentration of each compound (suvodirsen, other Wave isomers and analogs of drisapersen and eteplirsen), we quantified the extent of dystrophin protein restoration in vitro, and found that suvodirsen and other Wave isomers (WV-isomer 2 and WV-isomer 3) restored dystrophin protein expression to between 50% and 100% of that in normal skeletal lysates (Western blot shown below). Specifically, suvodirsen restored dystrophin protein expression to 52% of the levels found in normal skeletal muscle tissue lysates versus the approximate 1% restoration observed with other exon-skipping compounds.
 
We have confirmed target engagement of suvodirsen in an NHP study. We dosed animals with five 30 mg/kg weekly subcutaneous injections of suvodirsen over four weeks. Tissue samples were collected two days after the final dose, and nested PCR was performed to assess the presence of skipped RNA transcripts. As shown below, we detected skipped transcripts in all treated muscles that we assessed (right panel), indicating that suvodirsen successfully engaged with DMD pre-mRNA in vivo.
 
20

As conventional oligonucleotides tend to accumulate in the liver and kidney, we also assessed the accumulation of WVE-210201 in the liver and kidney of a dystrophin-deficient mouse model (mdx-23 mice) after a single intravenous 30 mg/kg dose. As shown below, there was significantly less accumulation of suvodirsen in these tissues up to eight days after dosing compared with an analog of drisapersen.
 
Exon 53
 Our second development program in DMD, WVE-N531, targets exon 53. Subject to our submission of clinical trial applications and approval to proceed, we would expect to deliver topline clinical data for WVE-N531 in the second half of 2020.
 In vitro, WVE-N531 induced dose-dependent exon 53 skipping up to 49% and dystrophin protein restoration up to 71% in DMD patient-derived myoblasts carrying a deletion of exons 45-52. In these experiments, cells were exposed to WVE-N531 at 0.1 µM-10 µM under gymnotic conditions. After four days of oligonucleotide treatment, efficiency at skipping exon 53 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. After six days of oligonucleotide treatment, protein lysate was analyzed by western blot for dystrophin protein expression.
 
21


To further study the effects of stereopure oligonucleotides for DMD in vivo and determine the relationship between in vitro and in vivo effects, we conducted studies in mdx23 mice, a longstanding animal model of DMD. We developed surrogate oligonucleotides that have similar chemistry to suvodirsen and WVE-N531 but target exon 23 for study in mdx23 mice. The mdx23 mice have a defect in exon 23 of the DMD gene and lack functional dystrophin. 
 In this study, stereopure oligonucleotides with similar chemistry to WVE-N531 reached the myonuclei in gastrocnemius tissue of mdx23 mice within 24 hours following a single IV dose. 


Four weekly IV doses of surrogate exon-53 targeting oligonucleotides induced efficient, dose-dependent exon skipping up to 20% in target muscle tissues of mdx23 mice, including gastronumus, diaphragm, and quadriceps, and restored dystrophin protein by up to 70-90% of that in healthy mice. In mdx23 mice, surrogate exon 53–targeting ASOs reduced serum enzymes elevated in DMD; serum creatine kinase levels were reduced by 87% compared with untreated mice, after 4 weekly doses.
 

22

Dose relationships of exon skipping induced by stereopure oligonucleotides were similar in vivo and in vitro. Transcript levels observed with free uptake of oligonucleotides in cultured myoblasts were predictive of transcript and dystrophin protein levels in the mdx23 mouse model. These consistent data from mdx23 mice support Wave’s approach of selecting clinical candidates targeting exon 51 and exon 53 using a cellular free-uptake model.
 Huntington’s Disease 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 HD is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease that results in early death and for which there is no cure. HD is caused by a mutation (i.e., an expanded CAG triplet repeat) in the HTT gene, which results in production of mutant HTT (“mHTT”) protein. Accumulation of mHTT protein causes progressive loss of neurons in the brain, and can lead to neuronal cell death, causing cognitive, psychiatric and motor disability. HD patients still possess wild-type (healthy) HTT (“wtHTT”) protein, which is believed to be critical for neuronal function. Accordingly, suppression of wtHTT may have detrimental long-term consequences. Absence of wtHTT protein has been shown to be embryonically lethal in mice. 
 Symptoms of HD typically appear between the ages of 30 and 50 and worsen over the next 10 to 20 years. Many describe the symptoms of HD as similar to having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) simultaneously. Patients experience a reduction in motor function and psychological disturbances. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 20 years. In the most symptomatic stages, often lasting over 10 years, affected persons become fully dependent upon others to manage all activities of daily living; they lose the ability to make decisions, feed themselves and walk, often requiring premature placement in a long-term care facility. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 people in the United States have symptomatic HD and more than 200,000 others have a 50% risk for inheriting the disorder from their affected parent. 
 Current Treatments 
 There are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow HD progression. Current pharmacological therapies only address HD symptoms. Antipsychotics are used to manage depression, irritability and chorea (involuntary movements). Xenazine (tetrabenazine) and Austedo (deutetrabenazine) are the only two therapies approved for the treatment of chorea associated with HD in the United States. 
Our Programs
 In HD, we are advancing two programs, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, each targeting a disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”) within the huntingtin gene (“HTT”): rs362307 (“HTT SNP1”) and rs362331 (“HTT SNP2”), respectively. Targeting mRNA transcript with these SNPs allows us to lower the mutant allele transcript, while leaving the healthy transcript relatively intact (see figure below). We commonly refer to this method (or approach) as “allele specific targeting.” SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is associated with the expression of a disease-causing protein. HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2 are two of the most common SNPs associated with the mHTT allele, which are believed to encompass up to 70% of the HD patient population. We have shown that by targeting HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2 in preclinical in vitro studies, the production of disease-causing proteins associated with HD can be reduced. As part of ongoing, required and routine toxicology support of our clinical programs, we continue to conduct in vivo nonclinical toxicology studies for WVE-120101 and WVE-120102. A recent in vivo micronucleus assay yielded results that require additional nonclinical studies that we are planning to conduct. WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 have been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of HD by the FDA.
 In July 2017, we initiated PRECISION-HD, a global clinical program consisting of the PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 clinical trials. PRECISION-HD1and PRECISION-HD2 are two parallel, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2a clinical trials evaluating WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, administered intrathecally, consisting of single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose portions. The primary objective of these two trials is to assess the safety and tolerability of intrathecal doses of WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, in early manifest HD patients. Additional objectives include measurement of total HTT protein and mutant HTT protein, and exploratory pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, clinical and MRI endpoints. Each trial is expected to enroll approximately 50 Stage I or Stage II HD patients, ages 25-65, who have screened positively for the presence of SNP1 or SNP2. Outside of the United States, we are enrolling patients in both the single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose portions of the PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 trials. In the United States, we received approvals to proceed with the single-dose portions of both trials. However, the FDA indicated to us that we cannot progress to the multiple-ascending dose portions of these trials in the United States unless we conduct an additional preclinical study and present the resulting data to the FDA for its review. For the single-dose portion of the PRECISION-HD1 trial in the United States, escalation to our highest proposed doses is subject to the FDA’s review and approval of additional monitoring plans. We expect to deliver topline clinical data from the PRECISION-HD trials in the first half of 2019.
 23

Using PRISM, we are also designing investigational oligonucleotides to target a third SNP (SNP3) associated with the expanded CAG repeat on the mHTT allele. Preliminary in vitro studies show that these oligonucleotides preferentially target the mHTT transcript, while leaving the wtHTT mRNA largely intact in human neuronal systems. The ability of these oligonucleotides to reduce mHTT mRNA is dependent on the specific positioning of the Rp stereochemistry.
 
In our preclinical studies, as shown below, the stereopure oligonucleotide WVE-120101 (circles) or a stereorandom oligonucleotide (triangles) were bound to wtHTT or mHTT mRNA and incubated with human RNase H (left panel). WVE-120101 produced greater knockdown of mHTT compared with the stereorandom oligonucleotide. In addition, WVE-120101 was selective for mHTT over wtHTT, producing relatively little knockdown of wtHTT. The stereorandom oligonucleotide was not selective and knocked down both wtHTT and mHTT. 
 
Using NHP serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to a panel of stereopure oligonucleotides and the parent stereorandom oligonucleotide, which were designed to target HTT. Each oligonucleotide was incubated at physiological temperature in NHP serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times, and complement activation was measured by the increase in C3a levels using the ELISA analytical method. As shown above (right panel), certain stereopure oligonucleotides and the stereorandom oligonucleotide demonstrated increased production of C3a; however, there was no production of C3a following exposure to WVE-120101, which also discriminated between wild-type and mutant HTT.
 
24

WVE-120101 was tested for potency and selectivity of knocking down mHTT mRNA in a cellular reporter assay. WVE-120101 targeting the mHTT mRNA was co-transfected into HEK293 cells with two reporter plasmids: a plasmid with V5-tagged full-length HTT containing the U-variant SNP1 (mutant) and a plasmid with FLAG-tagged full-length HTT containing the C-variant SNP1 (wild-type). Knockdown of mHTT mRNA and mHTT protein was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. All results were normalized to a non-specific stereorandom oligonucleotide as a control. As shown below, WVE-120101 potently reduced mHTT mRNA (left panel) and mHTT protein (right panel) and exhibited significant selectivity for mHTT at all doses tested. This study demonstrates the ability to knock down the mHTT allele while leaving the wtHTT (healthy) allele relatively unaffected. 
 
Following these promising preclinical experiments, we investigated distribution characteristics of WVE-120101 in NHPs. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe stereochemistry enables improved protein binding and distribution. The figure below demonstrates meaningful distribution of WVE-120101 in an NHP study. In this preclinical study, we employed an in situ hybridization (“ISH”) ViewRNA assay. The ViewRNA assay provides us with the ability to stain oligonucleotides, allowing increased visibility and understanding of the distribution of WVE-120101 in the brain. As shown below, we found perinuclear and nuclear distribution of WVE-120101 (red) in NHP gray matter structures following intrathecal administration. The NHP ViewRNA assay demonstrated broad tissue distribution, including in the cortex and striatum. These findings are encouraging as we believe that distribution and penetration into several areas of the brain will be critical for the successful treatment of HD.

 Preclinical studies on WVE-120102 showed similar results with regard to RNase H-mediated activity, mHTT allele specificity, and distribution in NHP brain.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia
 A hexanucleotide G4C2 expansion found in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD and is a strong genetic risk factor for non-inherited (sporadic) forms of ALS and FTD. Some patients exhibit characteristics of both ALS and FTD, indicating that these diseases form part of a continuum of neurological disease with some overlap in symptoms between them. 
 ALS Background and Market Opportunity 
 ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progression and degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosis may take up to 12 months and is made clinically by assessing the signs of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration in the same region of the body. Patients initially present with limb-onset disease (approximately 70% of patients), bulbar-onset disease (approximately 25% of patients) or with initial trunk or respiratory involvement (approximately 5% of patients). Age of onset is generally in the mid-to-late 50’s, and median survival is three years; however, up to 24% of patients survive for five to ten years. Survival in patients with C9ORF72 ALS may be shorter than in patients with sporadic ALS. 
 In the United States and Europe combined, there are approximately three to five ALS patients per 100,000 people. This translates to approximately 13,000 diagnosed patients in the United States, although the total prevalence may be around 20,000. There are one or two newly diagnosed cases of ALS per year, per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe combined, resulting in approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed patients in the United States each year. While the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, approximately 10% of cases are found to be familial in nature. The C9orf72 gene mutation is currently the most common demonstrated mutation related to ALS and is present in approximately 40% of familial ALS and 8-10% of sporadic ALS patients. 
 ALS Current Treatments
 There is significant unmet need for the treatment of ALS. Two medicines are currently approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS. Rilutek (riluzole), an inhibitor of glutamate release, was approved in 1995 for the treatment of patients with ALS. It was demonstrated to extend survival by three to six months. Radicava (edaravone) was approved in 2017 for the treatment of ALS. Administration of edaravone resulted in a significantly smaller decline in the ALS Functional Ration Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) through six months of treatment.
 FTD Background and Market Opportunity
 FTD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain. It is characterized by changes in personality, cognition (e.g., language impairment and executive dysfunction), and behavior (e.g., disinhibition, apathy and compulsivity). Diagnostic criteria categorize FTD into either the behavioral variant (approximately 60% of patients) or speech/language variant (approximately 40% of patients) based on the primary symptom observed at presentation; however, FTD results in dementia in all patients. The majority of FTD associated with the G4C2 expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is categorized as the behavioral variant. FTD frequently has an onset in mid-life, and death typically occurs within three to 14 years of onset. FTD is the second most common form of early-onset dementia in people under the age of 65, after AD.
 In FTD, the C9ORF72 gene mutations appear in approximately 38% of familial cases and approximately 6% of sporadic cases. FTD affects approximately 55,000 people in the United States.
 FTD Current Treatments
 There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD. Treatment to date has involved use of medications for symptomatic management.
 Our Program
 In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”), we are advancing WVE-3972-01, which preferentially targets the transcript containing the GGGGCC (“G4C2”) expansion in the C9ORF72 gene. WVE-3972-01 is designed to minimize the impact on normal C9ORF72 protein in patients, thereby reducing potential on-target risk. The G4C2 expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD and is a strong genetic risk factor for non-inherited (sporadic) forms of ALS and FTD. Subject to our submission of clinical trial applications and approval to proceed, we would expect to deliver topline clinical data for WVE-3972-01 in the second half of 2020. 
 Expansion of the G4C2 repeat alters the normal expression of the C9ORF72 gene and causes the production of repeat-containing RNAs. These RNAs accumulate in cellular nuclei in the form of RNA foci and can be translated into dipeptide repeat (“DPR”) proteins. Neuronal degeneration associated with the expression of the repeat expansion is hypothesized to arise either from a toxic 
 26

loss-of-function mechanism due to a reduction in C9orf72 protein or a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism through the accumulation of RNA foci and/or DPRs in the brain and spinal cord.
 By targeting the mRNA transcripts that contain the G4C2 expansion found in the C9orf72 gene, WVE‑3972‑01 has the potential to reduce both RNA-based and protein-based toxicity, thereby impacting the disease course and slowing the progression of ALS or FTD. 
 WVE-3972-01 preferentially reduces G4C2-repeat containing transcript levels in several in vitro models. For example, as shown below, administration of WVE-3972-01 to C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons under gymnotic conditions showed preferential knock down of C9orf72 repeat-containing transcripts relative to total transcripts. A clear dose-dependent decrease in repeat-containing transcripts was observed, with a calculated IC50 of 0.4 μM. In contrast, total transcripts were only slightly reduced and only at the highest doses tested, with a maximal reduction of 42% at 10 μM. Notably, approximately 20% of the reduction in C9ORF72 total transcripts can be attributed to the reduction in the repeat-containing transcripts.
 
Importantly, WVE-3972-01 led to preferential knockdown of repeat-containing C9ORF72 transcripts in a mouse model. In the transgenic model, mice express the human C9ORF72 gene from a bacterial artificial chromosome (“BAC”). In these mice, WVE-3972-01 engaged C9ORF72 across cell types in regions of the CNS critically implicated in ALS. The figure below shows that our stereopure oligonucleotides (stereopure) led to preferential reduction of repeat-containing C9ORF72 transcripts (right panel) in the spinal cord compared with all transcripts (left panel) in C9ORF72 transgenic mice. The stereorandom oligonucleotide (random) was neither selective for the repeat-containing transcripts nor as potent as the stereopure oligonucleotides against repeat-containing transcripts.
 
27

In addition, in animal models, WVE-3972-01 produced substantial reductions in DPR proteins and RNA foci, which remained low through eight weeks, the last observed time point (shown in the figures below). DPR proteins were reduced 76% and 87% in the spinal cord and the cortex, respectively. RNA foci were reduced by 70% in the spinal cord. These data have been replicated in blinded preclinical studies in an independent laboratory through our collaboration with Dr. Robert H. Brown, Jr., the Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research and Chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (“UMMS”), Worcester, MA.

Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
 Background and Market Opportunity
 SCA3 is a rare, hereditary (autosomal dominant) progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in a lack of muscle control and coordination of the upper and lower extremities. Signs and symptoms of SCA3 may begin between childhood and late adulthood, and they vary greatly. Symptoms may include progressive clumsiness in the arms and legs, spasticity, difficulty with gait, and impaired speaking, swallowing and eye movements. Symptoms of the disease worsen over time, eventually leading to paralysis. Some patients with SCA3 develop dystonia or symptoms similar to those of PD, including twitching of the face or tongue, and nerve damage (neuropathy). Life expectancy ranges from the mid-30s in the more severe forms, to a nearly normal life expectancy for those with milder forms of the disease. 
 SCA3 is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine stretch in the encoded ataxin-3 protein. Mutant ataxin-3 protein is thought to cause widespread neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord, likely through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism. SCA3 is the most common dominantly inherited form of ataxia. The prevalence of SCA3 is believed to be one to two cases in 100,000 people with significant geographic and ethnic variations.
 Current Treatments
 There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for treatment of SCA3. Treatment to date has involved the use of medications for symptomatic management.
 Our Program
 In SCA3, we are advancing a lead candidate targeting ATXN3.
Ophthalmology
 We are designing and advancing stereopure oligonucleotides for the potential treatment of rare, inherited eye diseases. Our research is assessing four inherited retinal diseases, which typically begin in childhood or adolescence and commonly lead to progressive vision loss: retinitis pigmentosa due to a P23H mutation in the RHO gene, Stargardt disease, Usher syndrome type 2A and Leber congenital amaurosis 10. Our preclinical data demonstrate that a single intravitreal injection of stereopure oligonucleotide in the eye of non-human primates resulted in greater than 95% knockdown of a target RNA in the retina for at least four months. Based on these data, we are working to design candidates that could achieve a therapeutic effect with only two doses per year. We expect to announce our first ophthalmology candidate in the second half of 2019.
 We believe PRISM affords us a unique opportunity to address these challenging inherited retinal diseases. Oligonucleotides developed based on PRISM demonstrate superior potency and durability as compared to stereorandom oligonucleotides and are optimized to minimize immune activity and can yield selective activity against closely related sequences. 
 We have demonstrated with preclinical, proof of concept studies with oligonucleotides targeting MALAT1 that our stereopure compounds exhibit these desirable properties specifically in the eye. These studies (see below) give us confidence that we can develop therapeutic candidates with the potential to be potently and durably active, which would allow for less frequent administration via intravitreal (“IVT”) injection and would give us an advantage over molecules delivered via subretinal injection or that are less potent and require frequent IVT injection.
 Our research is initially assessing four inherited retinal diseases:
  
• | Retinitis pigmentosa due to a P23H mutation in RHO changes the way the retina responds to light. Patients experience initial symptoms in early to late childhood, which include problems with night vision, with blind spots developing in the peripheral vision over time. These blind spots converge to produce tunnel vision as the disease continues to progress, causing many patients to become legally blind in adulthood.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Usher syndrome 2A is caused by mutation in the USH2A gene. Patients experience hearing loss, starting at birth, followed by progressive vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood. Night vision problems and peripheral blind spots develop as the disease progresses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29

 
• | Stargardt disease results from a mutation in the ABCA4 gene and is characterized by progressive build-up of a fatty yellow pigment called lipofuscin in the cells underlying the macula. Over time, this accumulation damages the cells that are responsible for clear central vision. This damage causes patients to experience blurry vision, difficulty with night vision, or impaired color vision.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leber congenital amaurosis 10 is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the CEP290 gene, which encodes a protein required for the survival and proper function of photoreceptor cells. Affected infants are often blind at birth. Other symptoms patients may experience include: crossed eyes; rapid, involuntary eye movements; unusual sensitivity to light; clouding of the lenses; and a cone shape to the front of the eye.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our discovery research has tested the hypothesis that controlling the chirality of PS linkages in the backbones of oligonucleotides will provide a benefit in potency, distribution and duration of effect in the eye. In these studies, we have employed MALAT1 as a surrogate target. We generated stereopure compounds targeting MALAT1, a nuclear-enriched, long non-coding RNA and evaluated them in vitro in iCell neurons under gymnotic conditions. We successfully delivered stereopure MALAT1 oligonucleotides under gymnotic conditions to iCell neurons, with our best-performing compounds exhibiting IC50 values approximately 24-fold lower than those of stereorandom oligonucleotides of comparable sequence and chemistry. We then evaluated lead stereopure oligonucleotides in vivo following a single IVT injection (5 µg or 50 µg) in the mouse eye. We assessed expression of MALAT1 RNA by qPCR, levels and distribution of oligonucleotides by hybridization ELISA and IHC, and duration of effect over a six-month period. 
 
In the back of the eye (shown in the figure above), the stereorandom oligonucleotide (SR+, 50 µg) produced a 75% knockdown of MALAT1 mRNA, which was maintained for two weeks. By one month, MALAT1 expression recovered to 50% of normal, and this level of expression was maintained for at least three months. At the same dose (50 µg), the stereopure oligonucleotide achieved an 85% reduction in MALAT1 by seven days post-single IVT injection, which was maintained at one month. At three months post-dose, a 62% reduction persisted. At a 10-fold lower dose (5 µg), the stereopure oligonucleotide still exhibited greater knockdown of MALAT1 RNA through one month (70% vs. 50% knockdown) and three months (62% vs. 53%) than the stereorandom oligonucleotide. By six months, MALAT1 expression levels returned to normal at all doses for both stereorandom and stereopure oligonucleotides. In summary, the stereopure oligonucleotide achieved at least a 10-fold enhancement in potency in vivo compared with a stereorandom oligonucleotide, and this effect was sustained through three months.
 

30

We assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship for the stereorandom and stereopure MALAT1 oligonucleotides (shown in the figure above). This comparison revealed that the stereopure oligonucleotide yields both higher tissue exposure and greater MALAT1 knockdown than the stereorandom oligonucleotide in the posterior mouse eye. 
 

In the front of the eye (shown in the figure above), the stereorandom oligonucleotide (SR, 50 μg) yielded a 65% knockdown of MALAT1. By two weeks, MALAT1 levels recovered to 50% of normal, which persisted through one month. By two months, MALAT1 levels rose to within 25% of normal, and persisted at this level through at least three months. By six months, MALAT1 RNA expression was normal. At the same dose (50 μg), the stereopure oligonucleotide achieved approximately 80% knockdown, which persisted for at least one month. By three months, MALAT1 levels recovered to more than 50% of normal, and this level of expression persisted for at least six months. At a 10-fold lower dose (5 μg), the stereopure oligonucleotide yielded results comparable to the 50 μg dose of stereorandom oligonucleotide at all time points. In summary, the stereopure oligonucleotide was 10-fold more potent than the stereorandom oligonucleotide in the front of the eye, and the duration of MALAT1 knockdown was shorter in the front of the eye than in the back of the eye with all oligonucleotides at all doses.
 
We have also evaluated lead stereopure oligonucleotides in vivo in non-human primates (“NHP”) following a single intravitreal injection (45 μg, 150 μg, or 450 µg) in the eye. This dose was determined by volume adjustment to correct for the approximately nine-fold larger NHP eye as compared to the mouse (i.e., 50 μg in the mouse is comparable to 450 μg in NHP). We assessed expression of MALAT1 RNA by qPCR, levels and distribution of oligonucleotides by hybridization ELISA and IHC, and duration of effect over a four-month period. 
 
31


In an in vivo experiment in NHPs (shown above), the stereopure oligonucleotide achieved a clear dose-dependent knockdown of MALAT1 RNA in multiple tissues of the eye (retina/choroid/sclera, iris and cornea) one week following a single IVT injection. 


In a longer duration experiment in NHPs (shown above), a single IVT injection of 450 μg stereopure oligonucleotide resulted in a better than 95% knockdown of MALAT1 RNA expression by one week, and this effect persisted for at least four months. 
 These preclinical studies support the hypothesis that stereopure compounds can be designed to increase the potency, distribution and duration of effect in the eye compared with stereorandom oligonucleotides. Additional research is now being conducted to further characterize stereopure oligonucleotides against the genetic targets listed above to treat inherited retinal dystrophies. 
 Hepatic
 We are collaborating with Pfizer to advance genetically defined targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, bringing together PRISM across antisense and single-stranded RNAi modalities, along with GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology for delivery to the liver. Pfizer has selected five targets, including Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), which is the maximum number of targets that Pfizer may select under the terms of the agreement. We will advance five targets from discovery through the selection of clinical candidates, at which point Pfizer may elect to exclusively license the programs and undertake further development and potential commercialization.
 32

Our stereopure GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide demonstrated an approximate 7-fold improvement in potency and an increase in durability in vivo in a human APOC3 transgenic mouse model compared with stereorandom GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotides. In this experiment, we generated a single stereopure stereoisomer, containing the SSR motif, and compared it with a stereorandom isomer of the same sequence. Both were designed to target APOC3 mRNA, which is predominately expressed in the liver. These isomers were also chemically modified with a GalNAc moiety, which improves their access to the liver. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy and durability of response, we administered the isomers to mice harboring a human APOC3 transgene (B6.Cg-Tg(APOC3)2Bres/J), and we assessed knockdown activity by measuring serum APOC3 protein. Similar to the results shown above, the stereopure isomer led to more efficient knockdown of APOC3 (ED50=0.3 mg/kg for stereopure vs. ED50=~2.0 mg/kg for the stereorandom isomer) (left panel in figure below) that persisted much longer than that for the stereorandom isomer (right panel in figure below).
 
These data demonstrate that two pharmacological properties that we can control through stereochemistry, increasing in vitro stability with Sp isomers and increasing in vitro catalytic activity with the SSR motif, translate to improvements in important in vivo pharmacological properties, including target engagement and durability of response.
 Emerging Areas
 We believe that PRISM will unlock additional opportunities to drive the discovery and advancement of stereopure therapeutic candidates in our initial focus area of neurology, other therapeutic areas in which we are currently advancing discovery programs, as well as additional therapeutic areas. We continue to explore ways that our multi-modality chemistry may be optimized to address a multitude of rare genetic diseases. Based on our design principles, we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly design and select lead therapeutic candidates with optimized pharmacological properties in preclinical studies. We intend to continue to advance these discovery programs and explore opportunities to expand to other areas independently and through collaborations and partnerships. 
Licensing Arrangements and Research Collaborations 
 Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of novel nucleic acid therapies. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and may enter into new partnership and collaboration agreements as a means of advancing our own nucleic acid therapeutic programs, investing in third-party technologies to further strengthen PRISM and leveraging external partnerships to extend the reach of PRISM into therapeutic areas where our platform demonstrates a competitive advantage. 
Our Partnerships 
 Takeda
 In February 2018, Wave Life Sciences USA, Inc. (“Wave USA”) and Wave Life Sciences UK Limted (“Wave UK”) entered into a global strategic collaboration (the “Takeda Collaboration”) with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”), pursuant to which Wave USA, Wave UK and Takeda agreed to collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics for disorders of the Central Nervous System (“CNS”). The Takeda Collaboration provides Wave with at least $230.0 million in committed cash and Takeda with the option to co-develop and co-commercialize Wave’s CNS development programs in (1) Huntington’s disease (“HD”); (2) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”); and (3) Wave’s discovery-stage program targeting ATXN3 for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (“SCA3”) (collectively, “Category 1 Programs”), which we will have the right to co-commercialize in the United States. In addition, Takeda will have the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs for CNS disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease 
 33

(collectively, “Category 2 Programs”). In April 2018, the Takeda Collaboration became effective and Takeda paid Wave $110.0 million as an upfront payment. Takeda also agreed to fund Wave’s research and preclinical activities in the amount of $60.0 million during the four-year research term and to reimburse Wave for any collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses incurred by Wave that exceed that amount.
 Simultaneously with Wave USA and Wave UK’s entry into the collaboration and license agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda Collaboration Agreement”), the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda Equity Agreement,” and together with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, the “Takeda Agreements”) pursuant to which it agreed to sell to Takeda 1,096,892 of its ordinary shares at a purchase price of $54.70 per share. In April 2018, the Company closed the Takeda Equity Agreement and received aggregate cash proceeds of $60.0 million. The shares purchased by Takeda are subject to lock-up and standstill restrictions and carry certain registration rights, customary for transactions of this kind.
 With respect to Category 1 Programs, Wave will be responsible for researching and developing products and companion diagnostics for Category 1 Programs through completion of the first proof of mechanism study for such products. Takeda will have an exclusive option for each target and all associated products and companion diagnostics for such target, which it may exercise at any time through completion of the proof of mechanism study. If Takeda exercises this option, Wave will receive an opt-in payment and will lead manufacturing and joint clinical co-development activities and Takeda will lead joint co-commercial activities in the United States and all commercial activities outside of the United States. Global costs and potential profits will be shared 50:50 and Wave will be eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments. In addition to its 50% profit share, Wave is eligible to receive option exercise fees and development and commercial milestone payments for each of the Category 1 Programs.
 With respect to Category 2 Programs, Wave has granted Takeda the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs during a four-year research term (subject to limited extension for programs that were initiated prior to the expiration of the research term, in accordance with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement). During that term, the parties may collaborate on preclinical programs for up to six targets at any one time. Wave will be responsible for researching and preclinically developing products and companion diagnostics directed to the agreed upon targets through completion of IND-enabling studies in the first major market country. Thereafter, Takeda will have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products and companion diagnostics directed to such targets, subject to Wave’s retained rights to lead manufacturing activities for products directed to such targets. Takeda will fund Wave’s research and preclinical activities in the amount of $60.0 million during the research term and will reimburse Wave for any collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses incurred by Wave that exceed that amount. Wave is also eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to mid-teen royalties on Takeda’s global commercial sales of products from each Category 2 Program.
 Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, each party grants to the other party specific intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
 The term of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement commenced on April 2, 2018 and, unless terminated earlier, will continue until the date on which: (i) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda does not exercise its option, the expiration or termination of the development program with respect to such target; (ii) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda exercises its option, the date on which neither party is researching, developing or manufacturing any products or companion diagnostics directed to such target; or (iii) with respect to each Category 2 Program target, the date on which royalties are no longer payable with respect to products directed to such target.
 Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for convenience on 180 days’ notice, in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis. Subject to certain exceptions, each party has the right to terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement on a target-by-target basis if the other party, or a third party related to such party, challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any patents within the licensed technology that cover any product or companion diagnostic that is subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. In the event of any material breach of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement by a party, subject to cure rights, the other party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the breach relates to all targets or on a target-by-target basis if the breach relates to a specific target. In the event that Takeda and its affiliates cease development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to compounds or products subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and directed to a particular target, Wave may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to such target. Either party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s insolvency. In certain termination circumstances, Wave would receive a license from Takeda to continue researching, developing and manufacturing certain products, and companion diagnostics.
 34

Pfizer
 In May 2016, we entered into a research, license and option agreement with Pfizer Inc. (the “Pfizer Collaboration Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, we and Pfizer agreed to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of stereopure oligonucleotide therapeutics for up to five programs (the “Pfizer Programs”), each directed at a genetically-defined hepatic target selected by Pfizer (the “Pfizer Collaboration”). Under the terms of the agreements we entered into with Pfizer and its affiliate, Pfizer paid us $40.0 million upfront, $30.0 million of which took the form of an equity investment in our ordinary shares, as described below. Subject to option exercises by Pfizer, we may earn potential research, development and commercial milestone payments, plus royalties, tiered up to low double-digits, on sales of any products that may result from the Pfizer Collaboration. 
 
Under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the parties agreed to collaborate during the four-year research term. During the research term, we are responsible to use our commercially reasonable efforts to advance up to five programs through to the selection of clinical candidates. At that stage, Pfizer may elect to license any of these programs exclusively and to have exclusive rights to undertake the clinical development of the clinical candidates into products and the potential commercialization of any such products thereafter. In addition, under the Pfizer Collaboration, we receive a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicensable license to use Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology in any of our own hepatic programs that are outside the scope of the collaboration (the “Wave Programs”). If we use Pfizer’s technology on our programs, Pfizer is eligible to receive potential development and commercial milestone payments from us. Pfizer is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of any products that include Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology.
 Pfizer has selected five targets, including Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3), which is the maximum number of targets that Pfizer may select under the terms of the agreement. Also, in connection with the Pfizer Collaboration, Pfizer agreed to be subject to certain standstill restrictions customary for transactions of this kind. The term of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement runs from the effective date until the date of the last to expire payment obligations with respect to each Pfizer Program and with respect to each Wave Program, and expires on a program-by-program basis accordingly. 
 
Simultaneously with the entry into the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, we entered into a share purchase agreement with C.P. Pharmaceuticals International C.V., an affiliate of Pfizer (the “Pfizer affiliate”). Pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Pfizer affiliate purchased 1,875,000 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $30.0 million. The shares purchased by the Pfizer affiliate carry certain registration rights outlined in the share purchase agreement and certain of such shares remain subject to lock-up restrictions. 
 Our Technology Licenses 
 Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH 
 In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH (“MI”), pursuant to which we obtained a co-exclusive royalty-bearing, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products in all fields of use under certain patent rights owned by Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (“MPG”), and patent rights owned by UMMS, which has been granted to us by MI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPG, acting as MPG’s technology transfer agency and UMMS’s authorized licensing agency for such patents. MPG and MI are collectively referred to herein as Max-Planck. Our license is one of two maximum allowable co-exclusive licenses for these patents, the other of which is currently held by Ionis. 
 Our patent rights under this license are to patent filings that relate to certain sequence and structural features of single-stranded RNA molecules that mediate target-specific RNA interference, and include both filings that are owned by Max-Planck and arose from research conducted by Thomas Tuschl, Ph.D. and his colleagues at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and also an issued U.S. patent owned by the University of Massachusetts (“UMASS”), that prevailed in an interference with one of the Max-Planck filings and was subsequently included, through a separate agreement between Max-Planck and UMASS, within the portfolio that Max-Planck is authorized to license. The Max-Planck licensed patent portfolio includes issued U.S. and Canadian patents, and pending U.S. and European patent applications, each of which has a projected 20-year term that extends into 2023. 
 We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice and payment of all accrued amounts owing to Max-Planck. Max-Planck may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we challenge the validity of its patents, upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we undergo a change of control and cannot demonstrate that we will maintain a development and commercialization program that is substantially similar or greater in scope than the program prior to the change of control event, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach (or 45 days in the case of nonpayment). Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the later of the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications with the patent rights covered by the agreement or April 28, 2019.

Our Research Collaborations 
 University of Oxford; Professor Matthew Wood’s Laboratory 
 Since April 2015, we have been collaborating with Dr. Matthew J.A. Wood, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Oxford and Co-Director of the Oxford Centre for Neuromuscular Science under a translational research collaboration agreement with The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford (“Oxford”). Dr. Wood’s research is in the field of degenerative disorders of the nervous system and muscle. His laboratory’s main focus is the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches using short nucleic acids to target mRNA. His team has been investigating the potential of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides for the modification of mRNA splicing, for example in DMD. In October 2016, we extended our research collaboration for an additional 27 months in order for Oxford to characterize our proprietary isomers in murine models to further improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides using our novel chemistries and to discover biomarkers associated with disease progression and pharmacological activity for the treatment of DMD. Under this collaboration, we are exploring additional exon targets, including exon 45 and exon 44 beyond our lead DMD programs, which target exon 51 and exon 53. In October 2017, we expanded our research collaboration with Oxford beyond DMD to include spinal muscular atrophy, with a term of 18 months. 
University of Dundee 
 Since September 2015, we have been conducting research in collaboration with the University of Dundee (“Dundee”) that involves characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of keratin disorders. We and Dundee have received a five-year grant to support a collaborative research project entitled ‘Delivering gene silencing therapy to the epidermic and ocular surface,’ effective March 1, 2017. 
University of Massachusetts Medical School
 Since January 2017, we have been conducting research in collaboration with Dr. Robert H. Brown, Jr., the Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research and Chair of the Department of Neurology at UMMS, an internationally known researcher and physician in the field. Our research collaboration with UMMS is focused on characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of ALS and FTD, and investigating the mechanisms of action of specific and efficient knockdown of the targeted mutant C9ORF72 mRNA. 
 ReadCoor
 Since April 2017, we have been collaborating with ReadCoor, Inc. (“ReadCoor”) to develop a registry of brain cell network maps and advance our chemistry for targeted drug delivery to the brain. ReadCoor is a company focused on leading the next generation of ‘omics by delivering the first panomic spatial sequencing platform to researchers, clinicians and pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies. The collaboration leverages ReadCoor’s proprietary FISSEQ (Florescent In-Situ Sequencing) platform designed to provide critical spatial data by combining next generation sequencing and three-dimensional imaging. 
 Deep Genomics
 We initiated our research collaboration with Deep Genomics, Inc. in April 2018 to identify and develop novel therapies for the treatment of genetic neuromuscular disorders. Deep Genomics is building an artificial intelligence-powered discovery platform that combines automation, advanced biomedical knowledge, high volume data acquisition and machine learning to support the discovery and early development of genetic medicines. Under the collaboration, we will analyze and test oligonucleotides against potential therapeutic targets within multiple genes implicated in neuromuscular disorders. The collaboration aims to increase the size of patient populations that may be eligible for treatment by expanding the universe of druggable splicing targets beyond DMD and spinal muscular atrophy. 
Manufacturing 
 To provide internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities and increase control and visibility of our drug product supply chain, we entered into a lease in September 2016 for a multi-use facility of approximately 90,000 square feet in Lexington, Massachusetts and initiated the build out of manufacturing space and related capabilities. In addition to manufacturing space, the Lexington facility includes additional laboratory and office space to support our growth. This facility supplements our existing Cambridge, Massachusetts laboratory and office space headquarters, enhances our ability to secure drug substance for current and future development activities and may provide commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. In July 2017, we took occupancy of the Lexington facility and began manufacturing production in the fourth quarter of 2017.

We believe that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party contract manufacturers and our internal manufacturing facility to meet our current research, clinical and early-stage commercial needs. We believe that the addition of our internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities, together with the supply capacity we have established externally will be sufficient to meet our anticipated manufacturing needs for the next several years. We monitor the availability of capacity for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our contract manufacturers and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity if needed. We believe that our product candidates can be manufactured at scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs. 
 
Intellectual Property
 We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our stereopure oligonucleotides. Our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally, as well as filings designed to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular stereochemical patterns (for example, that affect or confer biological activity). Our portfolio also includes filings for both proprietary methods and reagents, as well as various chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. In addition, our portfolio includes filings designed to protect methods of using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect particular stereopure oligonucleotide products, such as those having a particular sequence, pattern of nucleoside and/or backbone modification, pattern of backbone linkages and/or pattern of backbone chiral centers. 
 We own or have rights to worldwide patent filings that protect our proprietary technologies for making stereopure oligonucleotide compositions, and that also protect the compositions themselves, as well as methods of using them, including in the treatment of diseases. As of February 1, 2019, our portfolio includes at least 18 issued U.S. patents, at least 40 issued foreign patents, and pending applications in at least 37 jurisdictions. 
 
Synthetic Methodologies 
 
Our patent portfolio includes multiple families that protect synthetic methodologies and/or key reagents for generating stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. Certain synthetic methodologies and/or key reagents are covered by families originally filed by the University of Tokyo. We have obtained exclusive rights to these families, which include two issued Japanese patents that have terms that extend to 2022-2025. 
 
Additional synthetic methodologies and/or reagents are protected by families that we own. Certain families have 20-year expiration dates that range from 2029 to 2038. Some of these families have issued patents in several jurisdictions, including in major relevant jurisdictions such as the United States, Europe, and/or Japan; all have pending applications either at the international stage or in multiple jurisdictions. 
 We also co-own with the University of Tokyo certain filings that are directed to certain methods and/or reagents for synthesizing oligonucleotides; their 20-year expiration dates fall in 2031. 
 Stereopure Oligonucleotide Compositions
 Certain of our patent filings protect stereopure compositions, particularly of therapeutically relevant oligonucleotides. Some such filings are directed to compositions whose oligonucleotides are characterized by particular patterns of chemical modification (including modifications of bases, sugars and/or internucleotidic linkages) and/or of internucleotidic linkage stereochemistry. Certain patent filings describe specific compositions designed for use in the treatment of particular diseases (e.g., HD, DMD). Several of our patent filings directed to stereopure compositions have entered national stage prosecution in multiple jurisdictions; others are in the international stage. Certain filings offer 20-year protection terms that extend into 2033-2038. 
 
We also co-own with Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd. various patent families that relate to stereopure oligonucleotide adjuvant compositions and have entered national stage prosecution in multiple jurisdictions; these have 20-year terms extending to 2033-2035. 
 Future Filings 
 We maintain a thoughtful and ambitious program for developing and protecting additional intellectual property, including new synthetic methodologies and reagents. We also intend to prepare and submit patent filings specifically directed to protecting individual product candidates and their uses as we finalize leads and collect relevant data, which is expected to include comparison data confirming novel and/or beneficial attributes of our product candidates.

Singapore Intellectual Property Law 
 
Section 34 of the Singapore Patents Act provides that a person residing in Singapore is required to obtain written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents before filing an application for a patent for an invention outside of Singapore, unless all of the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the person has filed an application for a patent for the same invention in the Singapore Registry of Patents at least two months before the filing of the patent application outside Singapore, and (b) the Singapore Registrar of Patents has not, in respect of this patent application, given directions to prohibit or restrict the publication of information contained in the patent application or its communication to any persons or description of persons pursuant to Section 33 of the Singapore Patents Act, or if the Singapore Registrar of Patents has given any such directions, all such directions have been revoked. A violation of Section 34 is a criminal offense punishable by a fine not exceeding S$5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. There have been some instances where we have undertaken filings outside of Singapore, and there may be instances where we undertake such filings in the future, without first obtaining written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents. When this has happened in the past, we have notified the Registrar and the Registrar has offered a compound of the offences against payment of a sum of S$50 in each of these cases. Under Singapore law, the Registrar has discretion to offer a compound of such offences against payment of a sum of money of up to S$2,000. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our expertise in oligonucleotides, scientific knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on oligonucleotides, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Huntington’s Disease 
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of HD. We believe, based on publicly available information, that Roche and Ionis (Phase 3) have an investigational drug in clinical development and several companies have ongoing preclinical programs in HD, including Sangamo Biosciences, Vaccinex, ProQR, Nuredis, uniQure, Spark Therapeutics, Voyager Therapeutics and PTC Therapeutics. 
 A number of companies are developing molecules to treat symptoms associated with HD, including, Prana Biotechnology (Phase 2), Omeros Corporation (Phase 2), Stealth BioTherapeutics (Phase 2) Azevan Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), and Sage (Phase 1), among others. 
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 (eteplirsen), an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD in the United States in September 2016. The FDA concluded that the data submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in some patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. No clinical benefit of eteplirsen has been established. Thus, in accordance with the U.S. accelerated approval regulations, the FDA is requiring Sarepta to conduct a clinical trial to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. The required study would need to be designed to assess whether eteplirsen improves motor function of DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. If the trial fails to verify clinical benefit, the FDA could initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. Sarepta submitted a market authorization application in the European Union and received a negative opinion from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). That opinion was confirmed by the CHMP after Sarepta requested a re-examination of the application. Sarepta had indicated it plans to seek follow up Scientific Advice to explore the approach to bring eteplirsen to Europe. 
 38

PTC Therapeutics markets two approved therapies for DMD, Translarna (atularen) and Emflaza (deflazacort). Atularen was granted conditional market authorization by the EMA in 2014 for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD for ambulatory patients. In October 2017, PTC Therapeutics received a CRL from the FDA declining to approve their NDA for ataluren. PTC Therapeutics filed a formal dispute resolution request with the FDA appealing this decision. In February 2018, the FDA reiterated their prior position and denied PTC Therapeutics’ appeal and recommended a possible path forward for ataluren based on the accelerated approval pathway. Deflazacort is an oral corticosteroid and was approved by the FDA for use in DMD under the brand name Emflaza in February 2017. PTC Therapeutics acquired the rights to Emflaza in April 2017. 
 We believe, based on publicly available information, that a number of other companies are developing molecules that may alter the progression of DMD through a variety of mechanisms. Those with programs in clinical development include companies developing exon skipping therapies for multiple additional exons (Sarepta Therapeutics and NS Pharma), gene therapies (Sarepta Therapeutics, Pfizer and Solid Biosciences), and other non-dystrophin targeted therapies (Roche, Catabasis Pharmaceuticals, Intalfarmaco, Capricor Therapeutics, FibroGen, Santhera, Malinckrodt, ReveraGen and Mitobridge). In addition, Exonics Therapeutics is developing CRISPR/Cas9 targeting exon 51 DMD.
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia
 There are two treatments approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS: riluzole, approved in 1995, and edaravone, approved in 2017. There are a number of companies with potential therapeutics for the treatment of ALS in clinical development, including AB Sciences (Phase 3 completed), Orphazyme (Phase3), BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics (Phase 3), Genentech (Phase 1) and ALS TDI (Phase 1). Only one company, Biogen, has initiated a clinical trial targeting C9ORF72.
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of FTD. Few companies have investigational therapies in clinical development specifically for FTD. Ionis /Biogen (Phase 1/2a) and AlzProtect (Phase 1) appear to be including FTD in their broader AD or tauopathies clinical development plans. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new molecular or chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with applicable FDA good laboratory practice regulations and other requirements (“GLPs”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish safety and substantial evidence of effectiveness of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | thorough characterization of the product candidate and establishment of acceptable standards to assure its purity, identity, strength, quality and stability in compliance with current cGMPs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with cGMPs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more clinical trial site(s) or the sponsor’s site and/or contract research organization responsible for conduct of key clinical trials in accordance with GCP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”), which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 39

 
• | completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The manufacturing development, preclinical and clinical testing, and review process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Manufacturing development includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, development of manufacturing and control procedures, evaluation of stability, and the establishment of procedures to ensure continued product quality.
 Nonclinical tests include animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product candidate, as well as other important aspects of drug pharmacology. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Nonclinical testing continues after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve all outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, or if changes are made in trial design. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 Further, an independent IRB at each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must perform an ongoing review of the research on an annual basis until the trial is completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trials are not being conducted in accordance with GCPs, and an IRB may also suspend a clinical trial at its site for similar reasons. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website clinicaltrials.gov, key parameters of a clinical trial. For purposes of an NDA submission, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, generally at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for approval of the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 For some products, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as programs to communicate risk outside of labeling, prescribing restrictions, or certain restrictions on distribution and use. 
 Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. Any resubmitted application is also subject to 60-day review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 40

Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the PDUFA, first the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review for an NDA for a new molecular entity (“NME”) has a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe from FDA filing of the application. A Priority Review designation is given to products intended for serious conditions that provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, such as providing a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review for an NME NDA is six months from filing. 
 The review process may be extended by the FDA by three months from the goal date to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the clinical sites where pivotal trials were conducted and the contract research organization facilities with oversight of the trial, in order to ensure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the study data.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label and, even if the FDA approves a product, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk- management mechanisms, such as a Boxed Warning, which highlights a serious safety concern that should be mitigated under a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company is generally required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 
Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, generally those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, or that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, an initial review within six months from the time of filing as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm that the drug confers a clinical benefit for the patient. 
 Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), one of the expedited programs added is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all Fast Track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1 and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. 
 41

Modernizing Trial Design
 FDA sometimes initiates pilot programs to facilitate communication or other aspects of development to help advance approval of new drugs. In August 2018, the FDA announced the establishment of a Complex Innovative Trial Design (“CID”) Pilot Meeting Program (“CID pilot program”) to facilitate the use of CID approaches in late-stage drug development and promote innovation by allowing the FDA to publicly discuss the trial designs considered through the pilot program, including for medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA. Under the CID pilot program, the FDA will accept two applicants per quarter. For each meeting request granted as part of the pilot, the FDA will conduct an initial meeting and a follow-up meeting on the same CID and medical product within a span of approximately 120 days. In January 2019, we announced that the planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial of suvodirsen for DMD was the first trial selected for the CID pilot program.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to safety surveillance and adverse event reporting, periodic reporting, continued cGMP compliance and quality oversight, compliance with post-marketing commitments, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, and reporting manufacturing and labeling changes, as applicable. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for assessment of compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction, and sometimes notification of, any deviations from cGMP. These regulations impose reporting and documentation requirements on the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unlisted severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as noncompliance with cGMP or failure to correct previously identified inspection findings, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | issuance of field alerts, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, product recalls, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials using the product or other products manufactured at the same facility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, consent decrees, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may generally prescribe a drug for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote the drug in accordance with the data provided in the approved product label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have promoted false and misleading information about the product may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 The FDA has authority to require a REMS from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA may consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is an NME. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval, or at a later date should significant new risk information come to light. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary to assure the benefits of use of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, often at 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
 42

Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be the same drug as a competitor’s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor’s exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years, unless our product is demonstrated to be clinically superior to the competitor’s drug. 
 European Union Orphan Drug Designation 
 In the European Union (the “EU”), orphan drug designation by the European Commission (the “EC”) provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available, or if such treatment is available, there is the potential for the new drug to provide significant benefit. To be considered for orphan drug designation in the EU, companies must provide data that demonstrate the plausibility for use of the investigational therapy in the treatment of the disease and establish that the drug has the potential to provide relevant advantages or a major contribution to patient care over existing therapies. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
 Among the incentives available to medicines designated as orphan drugs by the EC are ten-year market exclusivity in the EU after product approval, eligibility for conditional marketing authorization, protocol assistance from the European Medicines Agency at reduced fees during the product development phase and direct access to centralized marketing authorization in the EU. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not, in itself, convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and authorization process.
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month period of exclusivity attached to any other exclusivity listed with FDA—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include a determination by the FDA that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population; a written request by the FDA for pediatric studies; and agreement by the applicant to perform the requested studies and the submission to the FDA, completion of the studies in accordance with the written request, and the acceptance by the FDA, of the reports of the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective, unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver from the FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 In Vitro Diagnostic Tests for Biomarkers
 For some of our product candidates, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies. If a sponsor or the FDA believes that a diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, a sponsor will typically work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”). IVDs are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and it issued final and draft guidance documents that are intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. 
 The two primary types of marketing pathways for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. If a company is required to perform clinical trials for the IVD diagnostic, and the IVD is viewed as a significant risk device, the sponsor will have to submit an investigational device exemption application, or IDE. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must meet both the IDE and IND requirements. 
 The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. If the companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be required. After approval, the use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic test that was approved through the PMA process or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process and placed on the market will be subject to many of the same regulatory requirements that apply to approved drugs.

Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other countries in which we conduct our business after a product is approved and commercialized. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Healthcare Reform 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the “ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Both Congress and President Trump have expressed their intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA has or any potential changes to the ACA could have on our business. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. These and other potential legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. The ACA, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Limited third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture commercial products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, disgorgement of profits, and other civil and criminal penalties.

Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
