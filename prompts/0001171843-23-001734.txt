Regulatory Climate and Environmental Considerations 
 
The Company’s medical customers typically require FDA approval for their products and therefore sometimes require their suppliers to manufacture in facilities that are FDA registered and comply with the ISO 13485 quality standard for medical devices. The Company has eleven manufacturing locations that are ISO 13485 certified and eight that are FDA registered. The Company’s automotive customers sometimes require their suppliers to certify their manufacturing locations to the IATF 16949 automotive quality standard. The Company’s Grand Rapids, MI facility meets this requirement. The Company designs products to provide optimum performance with minimum material. In addition, the Company bales and disposes of certain of its urethane foam scrap for use in the carpeting industry. The Company’s Newburyport, MA facility utilizes solar power to provide approximately 11% of its electricity, with plans to increase capacity in the future. The Company is aware of public support for environmentally-responsible packaging and products. Future government action may impose restrictions affecting the industry in which the Company operates. There can be no assurance that any such action will not adversely impact the Company’s products and business.
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company markets to the target industries it serves by promoting specific solutions, materials, and manufacturing capabilities and services. The Company markets through websites, trade shows and expositions, social media, online advertising, emails, and press releases. Its relationships with key material suppliers are also an important part of its marketing and sales efforts. The Company markets and sells its products in the principally through a direct sales force. The Company’s commercial leaders, in conjunction with Company engineers, collaborate with customers and in-house design and manufacturing experts to develop custom-engineered solutions on a cost-effective basis. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer’s sales were approximately 21% of total sales; no other customer’s sales exceeded 10% of total sales. Seasonality is not a major factor in the Company’s sales. See the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained in Part IV, Item 15, of this Report for net sales by market.
Manufacturing
 
The Company’s manufacturing operations consist primarily of cutting, routing, compression and injection, molding, vacuum-forming, laminating, radio frequency and impulse welding and assembling. For medical custom-molded foam products and thermoplastic welded devices, the Company’s skilled engineering personnel analyze specific customer requirements to design and build prototype products to determine product functionality. Upon customer approval, prototypes are converted to final designs for commercial production runs. Molded cross-linked foam products are produced in a thermoforming process using heat, pressure, and precision metal tooling. Plastics and other materials are sealed using radio frequency and impulse welding. Reticulated polyurethane foam is also used for many high-performance medical products requiring precision fluid or air management. These products are typically fabricated using high speed die-cutting or waterjet cutting. Laminated products for medical, military, and personal comfort and protection are produced through a process whereby the foam medium is heated to the melting point. The heated foam is then typically bonded to a non-foam material through the application of mechanical pressure.
 
The Company also engineers components for automotive use as interior trim and structural applications. These components are produced using a compression molding process to create highly functional composites consisting of various materials such as polypropylene/fiberglass panels, nonwovens, and fabrics. Highly specialized polypropylene based nonwoven material is used for automotive interior noise reduction and is fabricated using a die cut process. Foam for filtration, acoustical, and thermal insulation products that do not utilize cross-linked foam are fabricated by cutting shapes from blocks of foam, using specialized cutting tools, routers, water jets, and hot wire equipment, and assembling these shapes into the final product using a variety of foam welding or gluing techniques. Products can be used on a stand-alone basis or bonded to another foam product or other material such as a corrugated medium.

The Company does not manufacture any of the raw materials used in its products. With the exception of certain grades of cross-linked foam and technical polyurethane foams, these raw materials are available from multiple supply sources. Although the Company relies upon a limited number of suppliers for cross-linked and technical polyurethane foams, the Company’s relationships with its suppliers are good, and the Company expects that these suppliers will be able to meet its requirements for these foams. Any delay or interruption in the supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company’s engineering personnel continuously explore design and manufacturing techniques, as well as new and innovative materials to meet the unique demands and specifications of its customers. Research and development is an integral part of the Company’s ongoing cost structure.
Competition
 
The medical design and contract manufacturing industry is highly competitive as is the foam and plastics converting industry as a whole. While there are several national companies that convert foam and plastics, the Company’s primary competition is from smaller independent regional manufacturing companies. These companies generally market their products in specific geographic areas from neighboring facilities. The Company’s custom engineered products face competition primarily from smaller companies that typically concentrate on production of products for specific industries. The Company expects to compete effectively in the engineered products market due to its ability to address its customers' primary vendor selection criteria, including price, product performance, product reliability, and customer service, as well as its access to a wide variety of materials, its engineering expertise, its ability to combine foams with other materials such as plastics and laminates, and its ability to manufacture products in a clean room environment.
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 
 
The Company relies upon trade secrets, patents, and trademarks to protect its technology and proprietary rights. The Company believes the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how, and the development of new products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Nevertheless, the Company has obtained patents and may continue to make efforts to obtain patents, when available, although there can be no assurance that any patent obtained will provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to the Company, or that its validity will be upheld if challenged. The Company has a total of 18 active patents relating to technologies including foam, packaging, tool control technologies, radio frequency welding, automotive superforming processes and certain nail file technologies. The Company also has patent applications in process. There can be no assurance that any patent or patent application will provide significant protection for the Company’s products and technology or will not be challenged or circumvented by others. The expiration dates for the Company’s patents range from 2023 through 2039.
Human Capital Management
 
As of January 28, 2023, the Company had a total of 2665 full-time employees (compared to 1828 full-time employees as of January 29, 2022) and 303 temporary employees (compared to 187 temporary employees at January 29, 2022). The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
 
The Company strives to promote a workplace that is professional, provides opportunity for career growth and treats all workers with dignity and respect. The Company will not tolerate unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace; it expressly prohibits any form of unlawful discrimination or harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, ethnicity, age, physical or mental disability, genetic information, military or veteran status, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, or any other legally protected status under applicable federal, state, or local law.
