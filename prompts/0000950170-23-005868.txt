Company Overview
 Founded in 2012, we are a digital media platform which focuses on performance-first, privacy-forward methods to execute programmatic digital advertising campaigns, serving both advertising agency and brand customers. Without relying on individualized profiles or sensitive personal data for targeting, we utilize machine learning and advanced data analytics to make programmatic digital advertising more effective and efficient at scale, delivering measurable real-world value for advertisers. Our differentiated advertising capabilities and superior campaign performance, measured by customer-defined business metrics or Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”), have helped fuel our customer adoption and year-after-year growth.
 We use machine learning and advanced data science to organize, analyze and operationalize non-sensitive data to deliver real-world value for customers. Central to our ad-targeting and campaign optimization methods, we build custom machine learning models for each campaign using historic and real-time data to predict future consumer conversion actions for every digital ad impression. We have integrations with Digital Ad Exchanges, or Supply Side Platforms (“SSPs”), from which we are sent ad impression opportunities for evaluation and purchase. We predictively score all ad impression opportunities for the purpose of deciding which ad impressions will likely drive valuable conversions or engagement activity for our customers. Our predictive platform scores over one million digital ad impressions per second and 75 billion to 90 billion digital ad impressions per day, assigning a “predictive score” to each. Each predictive score is determined by correlating non-individualized data attributes associated with the particular impression with data corresponding to previously purchased impressions that yielded consumer conversion or engagement activity. Such non-individualized attributes include variables such as publisher, content and URL keywords, device make, device operating system and other device attributes, ad position, geographic data, weather, demographic signals, creative type and size, etc. The “predictive scores” generated by our platform allow us and our advertising clients to determine which ad impressions are more likely or less likely to result in client-desired KPIs. Our machine learning models are customized for every campaign and our platform “learns” over the course of each campaign as it processes more data related to post media view conversion experience. Based on these statistical probabilities or “predictive scores,” our platform automatically determines bidding optimizations to drive conversions and advertiser return on investment (“ROI”) or return on advertising spend (“ROAS”), bidding on less than .001 of the evaluated impressions. Our use of machine learning and data science helps us to maximize efficiency and performance, enabling our customers to avoid wasted ad spend related to suboptimal impressions such as impressions that are predicted to be at a greater risk for fraud/invalid traffic or impressions with a higher likelihood of being unviewable, unmeasurable, or not brand safe, among other factors.
 Our capabilities extend across the digital ecosystem to identify and engage digital impressions with the highest likelihood of completing customer-desired actions, including online sales, other online actions, and real-world actions such as physical location visitation, in-store sales or vertical specific KPI's such as prescription fills/lift or submitted credit card applications. Our custom and highly impactful campaign executions encompass popular digital screens — mobile, desktop, tablet, connected TV (“CTV”), Digital Out of Home (“DOOH”) — and all digital ad formats, including display, rich media, video, native and streaming audio. We actively manage our digital supply to provide advertisers with scale and reach, while minimizing redundant inventory, waste and other inefficiencies. Our CTV capability delivers scale and reach supplemented by innovative and industry recognized machine-learning optimizations towards real-world actions and value-added measurement services.
 Our platform and machine learning-based targeting provide privacy advantages that are lacking from alternatives which rely on individual user profiles or cookies employing a “one-to-one” approach to digital ad targeting. Our core targeting approach is statistical, not individualized, and as a result we do not need to compile or maintain user profiles, and we do not rely on cookies or user profiles for targeting. Our solution-set is especially valuable to regulated customers, such as financial institutions and pharmaceutical or health companies, and other privacy-forward advertisers who desire efficient and effective digital ad-targeting without individualized or personal targeting data. We adhere to data usage protocols and model governance processes which help to ensure that each customer’s data is safeguarded and used only for that customer’s benefit, and we take a consultative and collaborative approach to data use best practices with all of our customers.


 Supplementing our core machine learning-powered platform capabilities, we offer customized vertical solutions to address the needs of advertisers in specialized industries. These specialized solutions feature vertical-specific capabilities related to targeting, measurement and audience validation. Our broader health offering, which encompasses engagements with customers in the verticals and sub-verticals of healthcare, pharmaceutical, pharmacy, over-the-counter brands, and health-related government (collectively, “AdTheorent Health”), harnesses the power of machine learning to drive superior performance on campaigns targeting both healthcare providers (“HCP”) and patients, leveraging Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) compliant methods and targeting practices that comply with Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Code and other self-regulatory standards. In the third quarter of 2022, we launched our AdTheorent Health Predictive Audience Builder, a new-to-market solution which allows programmatic advertisers to use aggregated health data to research and target “audiences” in a more precise, data-driven and less opaque manner than what is currently available across the industry. This solution leverages primary-sourced health data and machine learning to create statistical representations of audiences, but notably is not ID-based and does not include Personal Health Information (“PHI”). These features allow AdTheorent Health Predictive Audiences to be built for performance, with the goal of achieving health advertisers' KPIs, while being privacy forward and HIPAA-compliant by design. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter and part of our strategy to establish a scalable foundation for the deployment of innovative verticalized solutions, we launched AdTheorent Predictive Audience Builder, a platform tool that allows advertisers to build customizable, machine learning-based audiences for other key verticals such as banking, financial services and insurance (“BFSI”) and retail. We have also created additional offerings tailored to address the unique challenges and opportunities in a growing range of other verticals.
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, our total revenue was $166.1 million, an increase of 0.4%, to our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $165.4 million. Our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $82.6 million, a decrease of 5.7% compared to our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $87.6 million. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $28.8 million, an increase of 13.3%, compared to our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $25.4 million.
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 total Adjusted Gross Profit was $109.8 million, up 0.4% over the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 Adjusted Gross Profit of $109.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $22.3 million, a decrease of 48.1% over Adjusted EBITDA of $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For a detailed discussion of our key operating and financial performance measures and a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Non-GAAP Financial Information.
The AdTheorent Technology Platform and Service Offering
 Behind every ad impression in the programmatic ecosystem, a “real time bidding” (“RTB”) auction takes place which connects prospective media buyers, such as brands and agencies, with valuable digital properties where there are opportunities to serve digital ads. Brands and agencies use Demand Side Platforms (“DSPs”) like AdTheorent to connect with suppliers of digital media suitable for and seeking digital advertisements (i.e., publishers like The New York Times). These real-time auctions are mediated by SSPs which are connected to the various individual publishers. We use a highly differentiated machine learning platform to assist agencies and brands with the optimization of their media buying decisions; they use our capabilities to identify which specific ad impressions are most likely to drive conversion activity from their digital ads. When desirable ad impressions are auctioned, our automated bidders will bid for each desirable impression with a competitive price, leading to either the impression being served for the AdTheorent-executed campaign, or the bid being lost. The following illustration shows this general workflow, as well as how we have been able to build a robust machine learning (“ML”)- powered decisioning and targeting solution on top of the RTB process to make it more efficient and scalable, as evidenced by strong and measurable performance for our customers:


   Unlike other programmatic advertising competitors, whose ad-targeting practices are generally reliant on the availability of cookies and other individualized ID-based user profiles, our machine learning-based targeting approach is statistical, not individualized. Cookies are used by advertisers to retarget a specific user based on the user’s web browsing behavior. Simply put, a cookie is a text file deposited on a user’s browser when the user accesses web content, which allows advertisers to track and retarget the user based on assumptions about the user’s interests. To the extent cookies are available in the digital ecosystem, we can access and use them in different ways, but we are not dependent on cookies for ad targeting. We are well positioned with regard to Google’s plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome, currently projected by Google to begin in the second half of 2024 according to an updated announcement in July 2022. Following its initial announcement in early 2020, several industry initiatives (led by Google and Microsoft) commenced to facilitate ad serving, measurement, and attribution in a privacy-first manner, which initiatives we have supported and adopted as a participant. These initiatives are centered around an application programming interface (“API”) based approach in which interest-based information and ad serving/measurement is managed within user browsers and shared in anonymized, aggregate forms. This post-cookie paradigm is well suited to us because our machine learning-based ad targeting approach is already centered around ingesting and using aggregated and statistical data for modeling. Parallel industry efforts to replace cookies with privacy friendly Unified IDs will allow us and the industry generally to leverage a form of one-to-one cookie replacement, but with more limits, and we are not dependent on these outcomes. We are also not dependent on third party partners to license user profiles or IDs as part of third party audience segments, which are commonly used methods for digital ad-targeting.


We have also used machine learning and data science to advance location-based targeting in a more accurate, efficient and privacy-forward way. Our approach makes location data more valuable and actionable as a component of machine learning-based predictive advertising, enabling advertisers to reach consumers who are currently at, or have recently been to, a location and have the highest probability of taking a desired action. Our Point of Interest (“POI”) capability provides a diverse set of consumer-focused retail and service businesses, and leisure and geographic landmarks, all available for targeting within our platform, utilizing more than 33 million consumer-focused POIs and more than 17,000 business categories to reach consumers at scale. Our location-based targeting capabilities are supplemented by machine learning-based optimizations in order to provide superior results for customers. Additionally, we offer value-added geo-intelligence solutions that enable advertisers to track relevant KPIs such as Cost Per Incremental Visit and Cost Per Visit, with such metrics verified by third parties.
 We similarly make traditional contextual advertising more effective by leveraging URL and publisher content to perform natural language processing keyword analysis as additional signals to inform predictive models. This provides us with enhanced non-individualized methods to leverage data signals that are capable of informing predictions about non-individualized engagement with digital advertisements. For example, our machine learning may identify that the presence of certain keywords or keyword combinations in a publisher’s content are more likely to drive engagement and action from users relative to a given product or service.
We use contextual and other privacy-friendly signals to offer cross-device, relationship and visitation targeting by identifying connections between devices and locations, all without creating or maintaining user profiles or seeking to resolve any user “identity.” These capabilities enable delivery of targeted ads across multiple devices. Additionally, we are able to amplify campaign messages by activating all devices connected to a network or community. Our capability for correlating devices using machine learning and statistics enables the extension of targeted messaging to friends and family.
In addition, although we do not rely on third party-licensed audience segments for ad targeting or optimizations, AdTheorent Predictive Audiences leverage machine learning models to identify audience quality parameters which are important to our customers, within which AdTheorent campaigns seek to identify consumers who are most likely to convert given the specific customer’s business goal or KPI. AdTheorent Health Predictive Audience Builder and AdTheorent Predictive Audience Builder, launched in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively, feature custom algorithms tailored to ensure “audience quality,” as determined in consultation with customers. This additional “audience quality” capability augments AdTheorent’s core ML-based campaign KPI optimization product-set, and offers customers an alternative to standard ID-based third party audience licenses.
 Machine learning technology may be embedded within creative ad units developed by our in-house creative technologists, referred to as Studio A\T, delivered through our platform. Our solution relies on machine learning for creative optimizations with creative elements adjusted and delivered dynamically based on real-time data regarding the consumer, location and other key environmental factors, allowing the advertiser to deliver personalized creative to our target consumers. Our machine learning enables the selection and delivery of the most effective creative solution for the individual consumer. Our in-house creative technologists support brands from ideation to design, through production and launch, making us a natural extension of digital customer brand teams.
AdTheorent offers customers two primary methods of engaging with our platform. Our full-service, or “Managed Programmatic,” model supplements our core platform capabilities with a full suite of media services, including campaign strategy and planning, media optimization and execution, data science as a service, reporting and analytics, creative and more. In addition to our Managed Programmatic method for transacting with customers, our direct access offering (“Direct Access”) is a user-controlled enterprise solution that provides brand and agency users direct access to our award-winning media buying platform and machine learning technology. AdTheorent Direct Access expands our total addressable market by making our platform and offerings available to customers regardless of their preferred method for executing programmatic digital campaigns.
 We believe that our Managed Programmatic and Direct Access offerings are complementary and can be used together, empowering customers with a flexible engagement model based on their unique business goals, internal capabilities and technical and other resources. The Managed Programmatic model is well suited for campaigns with complex KPIs and customers who desire additional support and value-added benefits including strategy, creative, and campaign optimization and execution, while the Direct Access model addresses the needs of customers with existing media trading teams and resources.

 Industry Overview
 We believe the key industry trends shaping the advertising market include:
 Fundamental shift to digital programmatic advertising: Digital advertising dominates United States spending accounting for over 70% of market share. Marketers are continuing to realize the benefits of programmatic advertising across a wide range of advertising channels and formats, including desktop, tablet, mobile, CTV, and DOOH. In 2023, more than 91% of all digital display ad dollars is forecaseted to be transacted programmatically and that percentage is expected to increase in 2024. eMarketer estimates that in the United States alone, programmatic digital display ad spending will rise 16.9%, to $148.8 billion in 2023, and another 12.9%, to 168.0 billion in 2024. Programmatic digital video ad spending is forecasted to grow 23.9% in 2023 to $82.5 billion, and 17.5%, in 2024, to $96.9 billion. As the broader market continues to mature and programmatic platforms compete to capture more of this growing opportunity, advertisers are prioritizing media buying platforms which provide measurable ROI/ROAS, as opposed to platforms which connect media buyers and media sellers in a more generic, less performance-focused manner.
CTV is projected to be the fastest-growing programmatic channel in the coming years: The TV industry is undergoing significant disruption as Internet-enabled CTV has become a preferred vehicle for streaming video content. The amount of CTV users in the U.S. is forecasted to increase from 225.7 million, or 66.9% of the U.S. population, in 2022, to 242.3 million, or 70.0% of the U.S. population, in 2026, according to eMarketer. Additionally, despite macroeconomic conditions, eMarketer's CTV ad spending forecast increased by $3.0 billion in 2023 to $26.9 billion. CTV provides many benefits to advertisers, including more accurate control of scale, addressability, and measurement. Advertisers are increasingly investing in CTV as more inventory becomes available and as they realize the benefits that a full-funnel approach can have for their brands. As the CTV advertising market continues to mature, advertisers will benefit from demand more customized solutions that drive real world business outcomes.
 Focus on consumer data privacy is expected to increase demand for cookie-less advertising solutions: Advertising has become more data driven and advertisers want to target customers while respecting consumer privacy. Internet advertisers in the past have capitalized on data from cookies to gain insights into users for retargeting, and they have relied on third party licensed “audience” data to target user profiles perceived to represent interested consumers. However, an increasing number of privacy laws and regulations restrict the use of personal data for advertising, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”),the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, effective in 2023 (“CPRA”), and other recent and forthcoming state laws such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (effective January 1, 2023), the Colorado Privacy Act (effective July 1, 2023), the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (effective July 1, 2023) and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (effective December 31, 2023). In addition, industry changes are restricting access to individualized IDs (internet browser providers including Google (Chrome) and Apple (Safari), and Apple’s iOS changes), causing some advertisers to reduce their reliance on vendors and software platforms that primarily utilize cookies and user IDs/profiles for ad targeting. In today’s connected world, we expect advertisers to increasingly need privacy-forward methods to identify their customers and connect with them across multiple channels,

devices and formats. We further expect this to drive an industry shift away from cookie-based and profile-based DSPs towards privacy-focused solutions.
 Machine learning applied in a programmatic advertising setting drives measurable ROAS for brands: Advertisers are looking for a centralized view of their customers, while connecting online and offline purchases to measure performance and ROAS. ROAS is a critical metric for marketing campaigns, and machine learning and data-driven solutions deliver the accountability that advertisers need and want, and great flexibility to utilize customer-provided data sets to optimize their campaign performance. We believe that informed advertisers will prioritize machine learning-based solutions to maximize ROAS in a privacy-forward manner.
 Strengths
 We believe the following strengths and capabilities provide us with the ability to maintain and expand our position as a leading technology platform and solutions provider for digital advertising:
 Award-Winning Proprietary Machine Learning Powered Media Buying Platform: Our technology and solutions, designed and developed in-house, have been recognized with numerous industry awards, and have been enhanced and refined since our founding in early 2012. Our machine learning-powered predictive advertising capability is engineered to drive superior outcomes (versus other advertising methods) for advertiser customers. We provide valuable differentiation through our proprietary media buying platform which uses machine learning and data science as the core method of ad-targeting and campaign optimization. Our predictive platform scores over one million digital ad impressions per second, and 75 billion to 90 billion digital ad impressions per day, assigning a “predictive score” to each, for the purpose of identifying which of hundreds of non-individualized data attributes correlate with customer-desired conversions/actions. Predictive scores are used to optimize media purchases and ad delivery to maximize customer returns on each advertising campaign.
Privacy-Forward Solutions and Approach: Our privacy-friendly approach to data and ad-targeting represents a strategic strength and opportunity, as industry privacy regulation increases, including but not limited to GDPR in the European Union (“EU”), CCPA/CPRA in California, and other state and local regulations. Industry changes, including initiatives lead by Apple and Google which will make it more difficult to access and use individual user IDs, reinforce the value of ML-powered statistics-driven ad-targeting. Because we do not rely on individualized IDs to target ads — instead relying on statistics and machine learning models — we are not dependent on cookies, device IDs, or industry-created replacements for the foregoing, which we believe represents a notable and growing advantage.
 Value-Added Vertical Solutions Which Enhance Differentiation: We offer customized vertical solutions to address the unique needs of advertisers in specialized industries. These solutions feature vertical-specific capabilities related to targeting, custom KPI achievement and ROI measurement, data and inventory, and audience validation. For example, many of these solutions will leverage data signals which constitute valuable KPIs to clients within those industry verticals (e.g., SKU level sales for Consumer Packaged Goods (“CPG”), prescription fill data for AdTheorent Health, viewership data for Entertainment, etc.). AdTheorent Health harnesses the power of machine learning to drive performance on campaigns targeting both HCP and patients, leveraging HIPAA-compliant methods and targeting practices that comply with NAI Code and other self-regulatory standards. Our BFSI solutions drive real-world performance within the context of regulatory requirements and data use best practices intended to prevent discrimination in the promotion of federally regulated credit-extension products. We have created additional industry-tailored offerings to address the unique challenges and opportunities in a growing range of verticals.
 Customer Retention and Growth Across Leading Global Brand and Agency Customers: Our demonstrated ability to address advertiser challenges and provide measurable value has yielded strong customer loyalty, retention and growth among a growing roster of the most sophisticated digital advertising customers. We have continued to meaningfully grow the number of active customers (which are defined as our customers who spent over $5,000 during the previous twelve months). We monitor active customers to help understand our revenue performance. Additionally, monitoring active customers helps us understand the nature and extent to which the active customer base is growing, which assists management in establishing operational goals. We have many long-tenured customers with 69% of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, coming from customers who have generated revenue with us since 2019 or earlier. This is calculated by analyzing our 2022 revenue and grouping customers according to the year in which they commenced generating spend with us.
Advanced Platform Automation and Efficiencies Which Drive Profitability: Key among the efficiency-driving features of our platform are our automated optimizer tools which allow users to drive performance and efficiency. Our platform optimizers automate intraday changes to targeting and bid prices at regular intervals to balance delivery (i.e., media

buying goals) with campaign objectives. Media buyers/traders leverage the optimizer to drive efficient media costs, KPI metric performance, and reduce time spent on manual adjustments. In addition, our platform includes automated campaign functionality which has enabled us to operate more efficiently at scale.
 Experienced, Long-Tenured Management & Team: Our management team has deep and extensive experience in the advertising technology sector and a track-record of delivering positive financial results and value creation for stakeholders, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage. Our long-tenured management and extended team has provided us with valuable continuity of operations and unanimity of purpose and mission. Our deep advertising technology, data science and operational experience, combined with our keen awareness of evolving digital customer demands and data use trends and changes, significantly contribute to our operating success.
Growth Strategies
 As the advertising industry continues to shift spend towards digital programmatic advertising, we believe that we are uniquely suited to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding market opportunity. We believe existing market fragmentation provides room for consolidation and disruption and we expect to capture more market share due to our ability to drive customer KPIs and ROAS. We believe that we have significant growth potential, which we intend to realize by pursuing the following strategies:
 •Advance capability differentiation and innovation: Our innovative digital advertising solutions have been designed with the commitment to driving campaign results for customers, using a privacy-forward approach to data and ad-targeting, measured by the specific business metrics our customers designate. We will continue to innovate and maintain focus on delivering solutions that deliver compelling value to customers. We believe that as we execute our product and technology roadmap, supported and accelerated by greater investment, we will heighten our differentiation in the area of data-driven and machine-learning powered predictive advertising.
 •Capitalize on market and regulatory trends favoring privacy-forward solutions: As privacy standards evolve and the availability of personal identifiers continues to be restricted, we believe that our differentiation will compound and be further prioritized by media buyers seeking privacy-forward alternatives to legacy methods of ad-targeting. We plan to accelerate marketing efforts to highlight our advantages to advertisers seeking solutions not reliant on cookies or one-to-one personal identity resolution.
 •Gain share through sales team growth, brand direct initiatives, further development of verticalized value-added offerings and expansion of Direct Access offering: We will seek to attract new customers and grow existing customers by continuing to aggressively scale our sales and revenue teams. The sales team will continue to serve agency as well as brand direct customers with whom we have experience strong growth traction in recent years. In addition, we will accelerate our investment in developing vertical-specific offerings to address the unique needs of advertisers in specialized industries in our wide range of vertical offerings. Our Direct Access offering expands our total addressable market by making our platform and offerings available to customers who have their own trading teams, expertise and other resources necessary to execute programmatic digital campaigns, and we will continue to enhance our user interfaces, workflows, and platform tools to make our capabilities intuitive and accessible for self-service platform users.
 •Gain share through enhanced audience quality capabilities designed to offer customers new alternatives besides ID-based third-party audience segments: We do not rely on third party-licensed audience segments for ad targeting or optimizations. AdTheorent Predictive Audiences leverage machine learning models to identify audience quality parameters which are important to our customers, within which AdTheorent campaigns seek to identify consumers who are most likely to convert given the specific customer’s business goal or KPI. AdTheorent Health Predictive Audience Builder and AdTheorent Predictive Audience Builder, launched in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2022, respectively, feature custom algorithms tailored to ensure “audience quality,” as determined in consultation with customers. This additional “audience quality” capability augments AdTheorent’s core ML-based campaign KPI optimization product-set and offers customers and alternative to standard ID-based third-party audience licenses. We believe these new capabilities will offer customers attractive alternatives to standard syndicated third party audience segments, which also represents cost savings and incremental revenue opportunities for AdTheorent and its customers.
 •Further capitalize on capabilities in rapidly expanding CTV market: We believe that our machine learning-based predictive advertising provides unique differentiation in the CTV marketplace, positioning our CTV offerings for continued growth. AdTheorent-powered CTV campaigns leverage custom machine learning models 


to drive measurable business outcomes (i.e. a credit card sign up) for our customers, going beyond the “video view” or “video complete” metrics that are widely used to define CTV success today.
 •International Expansion: Given the breadth of our offerings, multi-national customer base, and privacy-forward approach to data use and machine learning that is not dependent on using individualized data for targeting, we believe our offerings and solutions are particularly compelling to EU markets and other markets governed by or subject to current or proposed privacy regulation. We will continue to use rigorous criteria to identify which additional markets should be in primary focus over the next several years.
 •Growth through acquisitions: In addition to our organic growth, we intend to pursue accelerated growth through acquisitions with potential targets including business that help us accelerate entry into new geographies and more rapidly expand our products and solution offerings.
 Competition
 The programmatic advertising industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with smaller, privately-held companies, along with public companies such as the Trade Desk, and with divisions of large, well-established companies such as Google and Amazon. We believe that we provide a valuable, highly differentiated alternative to other programmatic media buying platforms and service providers because of our foundationally different approach to programmatic ad targeting, privacy-forward approach to data, and our performance-first approach and the measurable results our capabilities and solutions make possible. We believe we are differentiated from our competitors in the following areas:
 •Our machine-learning powered platform has been developed in-house since 2012 under the consistent management of a long-tenured and dedicated team;
 •We have operationalized into our platform advanced data science techniques in a manner that makes large and disparate data sets actionable in a real-time bidding environment;
 •Unlike other programmatic advertising competitors, whose ad-targeting practices may be reliant on the availability of cookies and other individualized ID-based user profiles, our machine learning-based targeting approach is statistical, not individualized;
 •Our approach to impression-specific predictive scoring is unique, effective and drives value and ROAS for our customers;
 •Our platform is omni-channel and highly scalable, covering a wide range of inventory, ad formats, and digital screens;
 •Our platform is highly efficient and automated, offering platform users ease of use and complex KPI attainment while facilitating operating leverage that drives strong financial performance;
 •Our verticalized solutions layer value-added custom services on top of our core platform advantages;
 •Our privacy-forward approach to data provides international expansion opportunities in markets where personalized and individualized ad-targeting is disfavored or not permitted; and
 •We offer value-added services for customers who desire “one-stop” programmatic executions, including strategy, creative, customer success, campaign optimization, data and analytics, data science as a service, and compliance support.
 Customers
 Our customers consist of many of the largest, most sophisticated and most recognized brands in the United States. Our top customer verticals and sub-verticals include AdTheorent Health, BFSI, and retail. We monitor active customers to help understand our revenue performance. Additionally, monitoring active customers helps us understand the nature and extent to which the active customer base is growing, which assists management in establishing operational goals. Active customers are defined as our customers who spent over $5,000 during the previous twelve months, which include a mix of brand and agency customers.
 We have grown the number of active customers 12.3% from 309 to 347 from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. We monitor this metric to understand the extent to which the active customer base is growing.


We have a loyal customer base as demonstrated by our long-tenured customers, or those with us for three years or more, which contributed 69% of revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
 Sales and Marketing
 We have a large, experienced sales team of 57 across the United States & Canada. Our experienced sales team is focused on business development overall, with an emphasis across key industries and media channels. The team is responsible for reaching and engaging new customers and driving revenue growth with existing customers. We provide an unparalleled level of end-to-end customer service, which includes support from campaign ideation to design, through production, launch and successful delivery.
 Due to certain macroeconomic challenges faced in the latter half of the year ended December 31, 2022, and our ongoing efforts to operate efficiently, we decreased our total net sellers by 9% from December 31, 2021. In 2023, we plan to invest in our sales team in a targeted and opportunistic basis to accelerate growth in key strategies such as AdTheorent Health, Direct Access, CTV, as well as to accelerate opportunities in new markets and verticals.
 Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness of our brand, articulating key differentiators, engaging core customer segments and driving revenue opportunities for sales. We work to increase visibility to our customers and potential customers through a variety of channels and initiatives including events, thought leadership (industry insights, awards, research, content), public relations, lead generation, social media, and sponsored content/advertising. The team supports the overall AdTheorent brand including the Managed Programmatic and Direct Access customer transaction methods, as well as deploying vertical-specific marketing initiatives across key industries.
 Intellectual Property
 The protection of our intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on statutory and common law intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws in the United States and Canada, and use contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We also restrict the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had three pending patent applications, one registered patent issued in 2022, and four registered trademarks. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domain name registrations, including adtheorent.com. Our patent issued in 2022 – “Data Learning And Analytics Apparatuses, Methods and Systems” – recognizes one of our valuable ML-based advertising innovations, which we leverage as part of our cost per action and KPI optimization capability suite. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.

 As of December 31, 2022, we had 297 full-time employees across the United States and Canada. Our team draws from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experiences across the technology, data science and advertising industries. We prioritize our people and are proud to have earned a spot on the Crain’s New York “Best Places to Work” list for the past nine consecutive years. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We engage consultants and contractors from time to time to supplement our permanent workforce.
Diversity and Inclusion
 We are committed to cultivating diversity and broadening opportunities for inclusion across our businesses. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 51% of our full-time workforce, 33% of our senior executives and 11% of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). Although we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation, we seek to continuously improve in this area through our recruitment practices, employee development, mentoring, workshops, community outreach and pro bono work, internal working groups, and by fostering ongoing conversations about human differences and the inherent value of all people in our communities.
Talent Attraction and Engagement
 We seek to foster community, inclusion, and diversity throughout the organization by identifying talent culture adds, with a targeted emphasis on the value and contributions of each employee. Our talent attraction strategy includes utilizing employee referrals and networks, with a generous referral award, job boards, including those focused on diverse talent, and

partnerships with organizations representing underrepresented communities. All job descriptions are thoroughly reviewed for consistent and inclusive language. We retain our talent through open and honest communication. Leadership is accessible to all levels of the organization. Feedback is encouraged through formal surveys, regular employee check ins, and the opportunity to provide anonymous suggestions. We continuously seek to improve, and we remain nimble in our ability to implement suggestions that will further benefit our employees. Employees know they have a real opportunity to be heard and to affect our business and culture.
 Training and Development
 We empower employees to develop their skills and abilities by following our core values and acting on great ideas regardless of their role or function. We work to provide an environment where talented individuals and teams can take control of their career growth. We provide a wide range of learning and development opportunities in both individual and group settings. We have ongoing career growth conversations, beyond a formal review process, and believe in investing in career growth and promoting from within. Similarly, we encourage employees to follow their interests and learn about new roles and departments. Employees can continue their growth by taking on new career trajectories within our growing organization.
Compensation and Benefits
 In order to be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available.
 We offer our employees a holistic total rewards package with premier health and welfare programs for employees and family members. We provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees and reward their efforts and contributions. We use internal and external resources to help develop plans that are fair and reward our employees’ commitment and performance with the goal of attracting and retaining high performing individuals. Third party survey results show we consistently provide rich benefits, and that our annual merit increase percentages are well above average.
 In addition to salaries, we offer dynamic competitive compensation programs that are in line with our peers and industry. To reward employee contributions and enable them to share in the success of the Company, all employees receive generous and attainable incentive compensation beyond their base salary and equity compensation opportunities, including an Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). We offer a 401(k) with employer match, employer-subsidized insurance benefits which are both robust and cost effective, flexible spending accounts, and employee assistance programs, among many other employee benefits. Recognizing the importance of work/life balance, all employees start with generous personal time off (“PTO”), which increases with tenure, and we offer employees an above average number of paid holidays. We offer company paid family leave and all employees receive full incentive compensation during approved leaves of absence.
 We maintain pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for employees performing similar work.
Health and Wellness
 The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. We strive to provide a work environment where our employees feel safe and are comfortable working, and receive support.
 Understanding and valuing the importance of work life balance, we have maintained a flexible work from home arrangement, leaving it to employees to determine a schedule that best fits their individual needs. We keep meeting times and deadlines within regular business hours and evaluate workloads to ensure even distribution and balance. For those who choose to come into our offices, we have created spaces that foster social engagement and sponsor reoccurring onsite events. Employee mental health is a top company priority, and we promote dialogue to ensure that employees feel supported. We advise employees to regularly take PTO, facilitate workshops promoting personal well-being, provide extensive subsidized health benefits, including access to mental health resources, and provide for gym reimbursement.
 Government Regulation
 We operate in support of many highly-regulated businesses across the United States and Canada, with significant un-tapped opportunity across the EU and APAC. Within the United States and Canadian markets that are our current focus, we are subject to a variety of, and may in the future become subject to additional, federal, state and local statutes and regulations in various jurisdictions, which are subject to change at any time, including data privacy and consumer protection laws. We

work hard to balance the most effective advertising techniques with responsible, privacy-forward methods for targeted advertising
 Although we do not rely on sensitive personal data to target campaigns and our business methods are not premised on the creation of behavioral user profiles, we provide product offerings that may result in receiving or facilitating transmission of consumer personal data. The United States Congress and state legislatures, along with federal regulatory authorities, have recently increased their attention on matters concerning the collection and use of consumer data, including relating to internet-based advertising. Data privacy legislation has been introduced in Congress, and California has enacted broad-based privacy legislation, CCPA. State legislatures outside of California have proposed and, in certain cases, enacted a variety of types of data privacy legislation. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions have also enacted or are developing laws and regulations governing the collection and use of personal data.
 We expect that the trend of enacting and revising data protection laws will continue and that new and expanded data privacy legislation in various forms will be implemented in the United States and in other countries around the globe. We believe that our data use practices have positioned us to provide market leadership as a privacy-forward leader in digital advertising. Moreover, since our platform does not rely on personal and individualized targeting methods to deliver desirable KPIs for our customers, we believe such evolving regulation will serve as a competitive advantage, as many competitors will need to reimagine how they conduct business to keep up with such regulations.
