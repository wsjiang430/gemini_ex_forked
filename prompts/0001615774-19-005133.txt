Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 
We design, manufacture and sell direct current, or DC, power systems for applications primarily in the telecommunications market and, to a lesser extent, in other markets, including military, electric vehicle charging, cogeneration, distributed power and uninterruptable power supply. Within the telecommunications market, our systems provide reliable and low-cost energy for applications that do not have access to the utility grid or have critical power needs and cannot be without power in the event of utility grid failure. Within this market, we offer three configurations of our DC power systems, with output power ranging from 5 kW to 20 kW and with three possible sources of fuel: diesel, natural gas and liquid petroleum gas.
 
Our DC base power systems integrate our DC generator with automated controls that are programmed to efficiently charge various battery chemistries to provide backup energy during a power failure. In addition, these systems are also used to provide prime power in off-grid and bad-grid locations in telecommunications towers. Substantially all of our net sales are derived from sales of our DC base power systems to Tier-1 wireless telecommunications tower companies in the U.S.
 
Our DC hybrid power systems combine our DC base power systems with lithium-ion batteries (or other advanced battery chemistries) to efficiently store energy from DC generator or grid systems to provide back-up power or prime power. Our DC hybrid power system replaces lead acid systems with longer-life and higher efficiency lithium-ion batteries equipped with our proprietary battery management system, or BMS, which protects batteries from being over charged or over discharged during daily use.
 
Our DC solar hybrid power systems combine our DC hybrid power system with solar panels to produce and store lower cost energy generated by the solar panels into lithium batteries, thereby reducing a DC generator’s run time and operating costs.
 
Recent Events
 
In July 2018, we began shipments of DC power systems to another large U.S. Tier-1 wireless provider, T-Mobile, through its channel partner. During the year, our shipments to T-Mobile grew to 22% of our net sales. As a result, we currently sell our DC power systems to the top three U.S. Tier-1 wireless providers and reached record level of revenues of $24.0 million and a record backlog of $16.0 million at December 31, 2018.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we installed DC hybrid system in Sri Lanka at an off-grid remote Tier-1 telecommunications tower site to demonstrate use of our DC generator and lithium battery system to power a remote site. Due to the lack of electric infrastructure, a significant percentage of telecommunications tower sites in Sri Lanka lack connection to the grid and thereby require renewable and battery storage devices in combination with generators to provide power to radio equipment. We believe that the successful demonstration of our DC hybrid power system in a prime power application will provide us access to the remote off-grid market in Sri Lanka.
 
In December 2018, we completed the installation of ten telecommunications towers in Namibia, which was part of the initial phase of a national program to bridge the digital divide between urban and rural Namibia. We believe that expanding our service offerings to telecommunications customers in emerging markets provides us with the opportunity to sell DC backup generators and storage batteries to these markets in the future.
 
In March 2018, we received Phase II approval and purchase orders for twenty light-weight, liquid cooled mobile DC power systems for use in the U.S. Army Robotic Mule project. This Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) program is part of a global military initiative to utilize electric propulsion powered vehicles to remotely provide surveillance, transportation and reconnaissance over wide areas, thereby improving survivability and reaction times in the battlefield. During fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered twenty systems for integration into Robotic Mule project. During first half of 2019, completed robotic mules will be field tested under various challenging operational and environmental conditions. We anticipate receiving additional production orders during 2019 upon successful completion of these field tests.

In November 2018, we began operations at our 29,000 square feet second manufacturing facility located at 400 E. Gardena Blvd, Gardena, CA 92804 which is located in proximity to our corporate offices and manufacturing facility. Our new facility is designed to increase production capacity of our fabrication, welding and final assembly operations.
 
Historical Background
 
We began operations in 1979 by releasing our first product, a solar powered vaccine refrigerator/freezer, for use in remote areas worldwide. This product was developed in support of a World Health Organization Cold Chain initiative and the U.S. Agency for International Development and for the first five years administered by the NASA Lewis Research Center. Since then, we have continued to expand our capabilities and product lines within the solar and renewable energy industries.
 
In 1984, we designed and manufactured test carts for Hughes Aircraft Company that provided cooling systems for testing F-14 radar assemblies. During the same period, we also supplied defense contractor, Martin Marietta, with computerized environmental control units for testing laser guided missile launch systems and a cooling system for a Phalanx Gun system to General Dynamics.
 
During most of the 1980s, we generated a majority of our revenues through development contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and major defense companies for the design of DC power generator and cooling systems. We retain design rights on all of our engineering and product development contracts.
 
In 1991, we began commercialization of technologies originally pioneered by these military contracts, which led to the development of proprietary permanent magnet alternator and related power electronics that encompasses a DC power system. During that period, we also manufactured solar powered refrigerators used by United Nations foreign aid agencies to store and preserve vaccines in field-operated medical care centers.
 
During the 1990s, we developed and commercialized an advanced Permanent Magnet Homopolar Hybrid, or PMHH, DC alternator that is lighter and more efficient than a conventional AC alternator. Over the ensuing years, our generators and controls were extensively field tested in a variety of military applications. Our PMHH DC alternator technology was used as an auxiliary power source in military vehicles and as a prime power generator for military missions in the field. During this time, we also engineered, manufactured and sold DC power systems for various other applications including oil and gas fields, rural homes and farms and telecommunications. We also generated revenues by providing short-run production, prototyping and design services to develop energy efficient DC power systems for customers within the military, renewable energy and telecommunications markets.
 
With the significant growth of the telecommunications market in the 1990s, we elected to transition from manufacturing products primarily for military applications to the commercialization of these products for the telecommunications market. We were one of the first companies to introduce high efficiency, light weight, compact DC power systems to this market.
 
In 2005, we developed and manufactured a computerized ground support unit for Martin Marietta that was used in the U-2 aircraft and in the Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle programs. During the same year, we developed our low-cost, higher efficiency 8000 Series DC alternators and our fully integrated next generation Supra Controller™ Series power control system which is designed to integrate and monitor engine controls, power controls and battery management system into a single integrated system.
 
From 2006 to 2011, we introduced our next generation of 8000 Series DC alternators with higher power output and efficiency and lower production costs with remote monitoring and controls. During this period, we obtained UL 2200 listing for our DC generators and introduced lithium-ion battery hybrid systems with our proprietary battery management system, or BMS.

In 2008, we expanded our marketing of DC power systems to telecommunications companies in an effort to supply DC power for the radio equipment located at a wireless cell tower sites as backup power in case of power outages. In 2013, after four years of extensive field testing, we received approval from Verizon Wireless to market our DC power systems to its regional facilities throughout the U.S.
 
In 1988, we introduced DC hybrid power systems designed for off-grid remote applications. These systems integrated our DC power systems with solar panels, lead acid batteries assembled into an outdoor enclosure with the capability to be remotely monitored and operated. In 2011, we introduced lithium ion batteries into our systems. During the 2013 and 2014, we shipped $1.7 million of our DC hybrid power systems, to two of the largest wireless telecommunications providers in Australia.
 
In 2015, due to a significant growth in sales, we moved our production facility to Gardena, CA expanding our production capacity by over 400%. A significant portion of our growth was a result of Verizon Wireless’s national campaign to add backup generators to cellular sites located in inner cities and remote locations with bad grid conditions.
 
In 2016, our sales peaked at $22.8 million, with 95% of these sales to Verizon Wireless. In 2016, due to the increased product demand, we decided to raise equity capital to fund inventory growth and other working capital needs. In December 2016, we successfully closed our initial public offering of 2,400,000 shares of common stock with net proceeds of approximately $17 million.
 
In 2017, we expanded our sales and service infrastructure to diversify our customer base globally. We established regional sales offices in South Africa, U.A.E., Singapore, Poland and the Dominican Republic and established sales and service locations in Australia and Romania to locally manage the Southeast Asia and EMEA regions respectively.
 
In the U.S., we are an approved supplier to all of the four top Tier 1 wireless providers. During 2017, we generated revenues from the top two Tier-1 wireless providers and are currently providing products to three of the top four Tier 1 wireless providers.   
In 2018, our revenues grew to $24.0 million as compared to $14.4 million in 2017. This growth of approximately 67% is mainly attributable to increased sales of our DC generator’s to Tier-1 telecommunications customers in the U.S. markets. In addition, during 2018 we received purchase orders from Namibia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Australia customers contributing 6% of our total annual revenues.
 
 Markets
 
We operate primarily within the telecommunications market and, to a lesser extent, in other markets including military, electrical vehicle charging, cogeneration, distributed power and uninterruptable power supply.
Telecommunications
 
We believe that investments in wireless telecommunications infrastructure is on the rise globally due to rising data usage and increased pressure to reduce costs requiring providers to improve operational efficiencies while expanding coverage of networks into remote or rural areas. Increased reliance on wireless networks is also resulting in increased demand for reliability of these systems resulting in higher demand for power backup systems. We believe that some of the key aspects fueling the growth of telecommunications operators include:

● | improved operational efficiency of telecommunications towers, with an emphasis on reducing power consumption and power generation costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased need for communications during natural and manmade disasters has resulted in strengthening of telecommunications infrastructure
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased active user base through the expansion of networks in remote or rural areas in developing nations; and the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | increased densification and data transfer speeds that increase the usage of additional services like internet and video on smart mobile devices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The electrical power requirement for cell towers can be segmented into the following areas:
 

● | Good Grid. Currently, the majority of our sales are related to new installations in the U.S. It is within this market where we have the most competition from legacy alternating current, or AC, generation technology. The technological advantages of our DC power systems as compared to legacy AC power systems includes smaller size, longer reserve (backup) time, lower acoustic noise, the ability to operate on low gas pressures, ease of installation and site permitting. Because backup generators are typically operated less than 100 hours a year, the higher fuel efficiency, reduced maintenance and longer service life of our products are oftentimes not considered in the customer procurement process. As a standalone component, AC generators are typically lower in cost than an equivalent DC generator. As in installed cost, in most instances, DC generators will have a lower cost. Most wireless companies are highly compartmentalized thereby making it difficult for them to validate the ownership advantages of DC generators over AC generators.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bad Grid: This is comprised primarily of the overseas market Within this market, it is not uncommon for an electrical grid to operate other than on a 24-hour basis. Oftentimes, these grids will operate for only 4 to 18 hours a day. Typically, the cost of bad grid electricity is lower than the cost of fuel, so the goal is to store as much energy from the grid in a battery while its available and then use the battery while the grid is not operational. For extended outages beyond the battery energy storage, a generator is used. Due to the higher number of generator run hours, fuel economy becomes an important factor. Here is where we believe our hybrid systems, that are combined with lithium ion batteries, are more cost competitive as compared to AC generator systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Off Grid. This is comprised primarily of the overseas market and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. market. We have been servicing this wireless market since 1994 (and the microwave tower market since 1985). AC generators compete in this market primarily due to their legacy presence and the lack of knowledge on the part of the wireless operators of the advantages of a DC generator. DC solar and non-solar hybrid applications represent our largest growth opportunities within the overseas markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to improve wireless tower efficiency, service providers are divesting these fixed assets to more agile regional tower operators, while simultaneously requiring an upgrade of the technologies to maintain competitive services as we have moved from 2G, 3G, 4G and soon, 5G services. As electronics efficiencies have improved, the amount of electronics on a cell site have increased thereby creating a greater demand for energy. The improvement in electronics, including the ability to operate at higher temperatures, has reduced the need for air conditioning. We consider this to be the single most important factor driving the use of DC generators within the telecommunications market. The other trend is the elimination of walk-in shelters in favor of housing electronics “outdoor” in smaller cabinets. Increased new construction of these outdoor tower facilities has provided us with the ability to market our higher-efficiency DC power systems to these tower operators globally.
 
 Military
 
Food, communications, transportation and weapon systems are the lifeblood of a military unit. With few exceptions, military communications operate from 28 volts DC or 48 volts DC sources. Currently, many guns (including howitzers), cannons and motors use computers and require DC power. The use or robotics to move materials from one place to another and provide weaponized platform will have a larger effect on reducing casualties and help counter the effects of IEDs. We believe that the demand for DC power with the military is increasing as the use of pulsed energy weapon systems (i.e., weapons that either use pulses of electricity to fire ammunition or operate by sending an electric current to a target) are more widely used on the battle field. This increased use of electronics in military missions has resulted in an increased need for DC power and for more efficient ways of generating, storing and distributing energy. The military has assigned a special program management department to oversee the development and standardization of a new range of higher efficiency mobile power generators ranging in size from 5 kW to 200 kW. With pulsed weapon systems, DC power requirements can climb as high as 6 megawatts.

The objectives of the creation of a new generation of power generators are:
 

● | enhanced mobility, reliability and maintainability;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | improved fuel efficiency;
--+--------------------------


● | reduced system size and weight;
--+--------------------------------


● | reduced infrared and acoustic signatures;
--+------------------------------------------


● | increased survivability in rugged combat operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced total cost of ownership.
--+---------------------------------

 
Once the Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources, or the AMMPS, the U.S. Department of Defense’s third generation of military power generators, is fully implemented in vehicles and stationary platforms, it is expected that the new generators will save over 50 million gallons of fuel per year, according to the Mobile Electric Power Systems Command Brief issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2009. The new generation of mobile electric power generators will also have the capability to connect together to form an efficient power distribution center to create “power islands” that serve both DC and AC loads. In addition, solar and wind power is being added to AMMPS to create hybrid systems that can function as self-sustaining power sources in remote areas. The next generation of power systems are required to provide 21% higher fuel efficiency, reduce noise and weight and be capable of performing in extreme environments. Our DC hybrid power systems, with integrated controls that manage energy produced by solar and lithium battery solutions, provide higher fuel efficiency than traditional fossil fuel powered power systems currently used by the military. We believe our complete line of commercialized DC hybrid power systems in use for the past decade provides us with a competitive advantage in meeting stated power system goals outlined by Department of Defense.
 
Improvements in sensors, navigation and communication technologies have led to increased integration of situational awareness systems that allow all combat assets to communicate and coordinate both defensive and offensive efforts in combat. Reliance on these systems has led to an effort to integrate DC auxiliary power units ranging in size from 3 kW to 20 kW onboard combat vehicles independent of engine driven alternators. Integration of auxiliary power units to run climate control and on-board electronics while idling saves a significant amount of fuel and maintenance, a critical asset during combat operations. We believe that the integration of smaller horsepower auxiliary power units to operate climate control and on-board electronics systems, rather than large horsepower vehicle engines while idling, may save a significant amount of fuel and maintenance, both of which are critical assets during combat operations.
 
During the past two decades, we have shipped 2 kW and 30 kW advanced power units, comprised of hybrid vehicle power systems, auxiliary power systems and prime power systems, to the U.S. Department of Defense and to its prime contractors for a wide variety of missions covering the land, sea and air. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, sales of auxiliary power systems designed for use in military combat vehicles represented 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively, of our net sales. 
 
Residential and Commercial Power 
 
Combining a high-efficiency propane or natural gas fueled DC generator (i.e., low capital cost) with a zero-emissions renewable energy source (i.e., low operating cost) results in low-cost sustainable power. This is premise behind our solar hybrid system.

We believe that by using a DC generator operating on natural gas, with or without a solar PV array, will be instrumental in assisting electric utilities in meeting the increased power demand for electric car charging. Many homes and commercial business are without sufficient power to charge an electric vehicle, or EV, or fleet of EVs and the ability to increase electrical service can be cost prohibitive. In addition, the utilities’ energy cost during peak demand may become too high making natural gas a cost-competitive alternative to the electric grid.
 
We also believe that energy requirements associated with EV charging could drive the use of combined heat and electrical power, or CHP.
 
Using DC generators with inverters in a CHP application could replace oil-fueled heaters in the Eastern U.S. These products can produce space heating and electricity at the same time. An advantage of CHP over current oil and natural fueled heating is that grid power is not required to operate the heaters blowers, fuel pumps, or controls. Our technology allows continued heating and provides electricity in the worst of storms.
 
Our Competitive Strengths 
 
We have over a 30-year history and have developed a reputation as a proven supplier of reliable and advanced proprietary technology products to customers within the telecommunications, military, industrial and marine markets. We have invested significant capital and engineering expertise to develop products that capitalize on the growing trend towards environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient power generation systems. We further believe our success will be based on the following key competitive strengths:

● | Proprietary Technologies. Our decades of research and development efforts has led to the integration of high-efficiency DC alternator technology integrated with conventional engines to provide highly reliable backup power solutions for telecommunications towers. During the last decade, we invested significant capital in the development of charge control algorithms that allow our DC power generators to safely charge various types of battery chemistries. We believe this feature, combined with our ability to remotely monitor our DC generators, gives our customers higher field reliability and uptime when compared to conventional AC generators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engineering Expertise. During 2018, we invested significant capital in expanding our field sales staff globally. Our direct sales model, where our engineers and sales personnel jointly assess customer needs and design customized solutions, has resulted in success with the top three Tier-1 wireless providers in the U.S. We design and manufacture DC alternators, controls and enclosures in-house. We believe this allows us to customize designs to applications reducing system weight and size. In addition, DC alternators are inherently more efficient than AC systems, thereby more fuel efficient. Our proprietary battery charging algorithms reduce generator run time thereby reducing maintenance cost and increasing life.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacturing Competitiveness. We believe that our vertical integration approach to manufacturing lowers our production costs and improves our overall operational efficiency. In addition, vertically integrated manufacturing of our proprietary technologies such as DC alternators, charge controls and battery management systems, provides us with a greater control and protection over our intellectual property. We believe our modular approach to manufacturing provides us with the lowest manufacturing costs for our proprietary technologies while giving us the ability to deliver customized solutions to our Tier-1 wireless provider customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Customer Base. A significant percentage of our sales are comprised of direct sales to our customers. Currently, significant percentage of our U.S. sales are to national Tier-1 telecommunications providers with multiple facilities. Since 2017, we substantially expanded our global sales and service network to market directly to Tier-1 telecommunications providers. In the international markets, our customers are regional Tier-1 telecommunications providers. We have established sales offices in Namibia, Dubai, Singapore, Australia, Poland and the Dominican Republic. Our sales team directly markets to Tier-1 companies in their regions and during 2018, we received initial purchase orders from Tier-1 telecommunications providers in Namibia, Sri Lanka, Australia and Thailand.

● | Experienced Management Team. Each of our President and Chief Executive Officer and key engineers has over 25 years of engineering and production experience in the design and manufacturing of power systems. Our engineers have equipment design experience, as well as hands-on skills to build prototypes. A key factor demonstrating management’s abilities and our engineering aptitude can be found in our successful track record over the last 25 years of executing fixed-cost research, design and engineering contracts, with an average of eight projects per year.

Business Strategy
 
We believe the growth in wireless telecommunications infrastructure in the U.S. and international markets has led to a rapid rise in the need for DC backup power systems. With our 30 years of experience and reputation within the DC power systems market, we are working to increase awareness, availability and affordability of more efficient DC-based products as a backup power and charging source within the telecommunications industry. Because of the increased reliance on wireless networks during emergencies and natural disasters, existing and new wireless installations are being upgraded to provide reliable operations during time of emergency. The primary elements of our business strategy include:

● | Further develop U.S. mobile telecommunications market. We continue to invest significant capital into our sales and marketing efforts to demonstrate our DC power systems to the top Tier-1 wireless providers in the U.S. During 2019, we expect to reach out to the more than 500 small wireless and cable operators in North America to discuss the benefits of our product offerings. These small telecommunications companies service rural areas that have more off-the-grid sites than the Tier 1 wireless telecommunications companies. Our goal is to further diversify our customer base. In 2018, 75% of our sales of DC power systems were to Tier-1 telecommunications customers. We believe increased demand to equip cellular tower sites with backup equipment, combined with our ability to compete on an economic basis with AC power systems at large volumes, will result in a significant transition of the marketplace from AC power systems to DC power systems. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand global sales to bad-grid or off-grid markets: The increase in subscriber base in rural and remote areas in developing countries has increased the deployment of telecommunication sites in off-grid and bad-grid areas. Approximately 94% of our DC power systems sales are to U.S. customers, which we believe represents only 4.7% of the total global telecommunications market. Due to frequent power outages and lack of electric infrastructure in rural areas in developing nations, we believe a significant opportunity exists for sales of our backup DC power systems to customers located in regions, such as South East Asia, Australia and Africa. In 2017, we established regional direct sales offices in South Africa, U.A.E., Singapore, Australia, Romania, Poland and Dominican Republic to directly connect with Tier-1 telecommunications providers. During 2018 we demonstrated DC and DC Hybrid systems in South East Asia and Africa which have resulted in purchase orders and the approval of our products by over 35 Tier-1 telecommunications providers in those regions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop LPG and Natural Gas DC power systems. Increases in natural disasters and emergencies during the past decade has resulted in increased demand for backup power systems for residential and commercial applications. In addition, we believe that the rise in popularity of EV vehicles and trucks will strain the electrical grid creating the need to use natural gas to supplement the grid in a manner similar to what happened in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s. During that time, Japan used natural gas engines to power air-conditioning compressors thereby removing a large electrical demand from their electrical grid. The Gas Research Institute tried to develop a similar product for U.S. markets during that period, but the engine failed to meet market expectations. During 2018, we developed a supply relationship with Toyota Engines in Japan and Bosch in Germany to develop a new series of long-life, low-maintenance, fuel-efficient engines. This newer engine will replace our Kubota gas engines in our DC generators and which we believe will increase our competitiveness in both telecommunications and solar hybrid applications. We believe ease of access to natural gas and propane during natural emergencies in residential and commercial areas is a key advantage for our new product line. We plan to release this product line to market during the third quarter of 2019, initially targeting local regional markets in the western United States, while later expanding internationally in 2020.

● | Expand renewable solar energy product offerings. We believe that increased environmental regulations, combined with the declining cost of solar and advanced storage batteries, has accelerated the shift of the telecommunications tower operators towards solar hybrid systems in off-grid and bad-grid regions worldwide. In 2013, we delivered 20 solar hybrid renewable energy DC power systems to the largest mobile telecommunications provider in Australia for installation in a remote mobile tower application. In developing regions like Africa, South East Asia and Latin America significant parts of these regions lack a basic electricity grid. In order to provide telecommunications services, companies require a combination of renewable and fossil fuel-based power generation solutions to be cost effective. In 2018, we demonstrated solar hybrid storage systems in Sri Lanka at a remote off-grid site to prove viability of our DC generators in prime power applications. We plan to target power markets in South East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where local governments are incentivizing the use of renewable energy within the telecommunications industry through favored spectrum auctions and tax incentives.

Our Technologies
    In 1991, we began introducing DC power systems to provide backup and prime power for off-grid and bad-grid applications. Our initial products were predominantly designed for military applications and used as auxiliary power for vehicles, tanks and radar sites. In the late 1990s, we introduced our DC power systems for commercial applications like mobile telecommunications towers, solar refrigerators and oil field applications.
 
In 1992, we developed our own proprietary DC alternator to improve system efficiency, reduce costs and lower weight. Our design replaced a conventional 4-pole, three-phase designs with a light weight, low cost 12-pole and 32-pole designs (i.e., designs containing 12 or 36 magnetic poles) incorporating either 6 or 3 phases (i.e., containing 6 or 3 power circuits). Another unique aspect of the design of our DC alternators is the elimination of bearings, internal wiring connections, and an exciter (i.e., a device which supplies the magnetizing current to generate working flux) to provide a longer life cycle than conventional motor designs in the marketplace.
 
In 2002, we introduced our 6200 PMHH alternator, which combines the attributes of homopolar alternator technology with a permanent magnet. When mounted on an engine and operated at either a fixed or variable speed, the model 6200 PMHH generates a precise amount of regulated voltage and current. The DC output can then be used to power electronics or charge batteries.
 
In 2006, we introduced our next generation 8000 Series alternators designed for higher power and voltage applications, which features our proprietary 32-pole permanent magnet alternator technology. The 8000 Series offers high efficiency at a lower cost while integrating our proprietary digital control system, Supra Controller™, that manages and optimizes alternator output. Our Supra Controller™ networks all components via CAN bus communications and software and has the ability to control, analyze, monitor, record and communicate all key system parameters to ensure efficiency, safety and reliability of the overall system. The ability to remotely monitor and calibrate each system parameter, receive system alarms and auto-reset the system when a fault is corrected are the key differentiating factors of our DC power systems.
 
In telecommunications tower backup applications, backup generators are used to provide power during grid outages or to charge batteries to provide longer run times during emergencies. Due to battery costs and availability issues, many telecommunications providers are known to use various types of chemistries or capacities as storage sources. During the past decade, we have successfully integrated various battery chemistry charge algorithms into our Supra Controller™ software.
 
In 2011, we added charge algorithms for various lithium battery chemistries and integrated our proprietary BMS with our Supra Controller™ software. In 2013, we further expanded the integration of storage and renewable energy such as solar and wind into our Supra Controller™ software resulting in the shipment of twenty off-grid telecommunications tower power systems to Australia.
 
In 2017 and 2018, we demonstrated our DC hybrid power systems to telecommunications providers in South East Asia and Africa. We believe that the integration of renewable energy and storage batteries are ideal for off-grid remote locations in rural areas worldwide. During 2019, we plan to continue our research and development efforts to further enhance these integrations for remote telecommunications towers in South East Asia and Africa.

In 2018, we developed our next generation BMS that enhances our current technology to more accurately measure, monitor, control and integrate battery performance data with our Supra Controller™. In addition, we enhanced the user interface to allow us the ability to update or develop new charging algorithms in the field which can be remotely programmed or uploaded. We believe these enhancements will increase our penetration into the battery storage market during 2019.
 
 Products and Services
 
We broadly classify our power systems into three categories:
 

● | DC base power systems. Our basic system which is centered around a DC generator. Applications include both prime power and backup power.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DC hybrid power systems. Our basic DC power system with added energy storage via lithium-ion or other battery chemistries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DC Solar hybrid power systems. Our DC hybrid power system with added renewable energy (i.e., solar panels).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DC Base Power Systems
 
Our DC base power systems are designed for use in prime power and backup power applications. All of our DC power systems are designed to last 20 years or more in backup applications and meet all UL2200 standards. To maximize operational life, we incorporate (over and above our competition) the following:

● | all aluminum, powder coated, enclosure with stainless hardware, which is lightweight and corrosion resistant;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 105 C rated signal wire, tinned copper strands;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | stainless steel braided covering hoses for fuel and coolant lines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class 220 C magnet wire for alternator windings; 


● | watertight connectors in place of terminal strips and other non-sealed connectors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Supra Controller™ modules that are environmentally sealed.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that the number one reliability issue with a generator set is the failure to start. To improve the reliability of our generators, we remove the engine’s starting battery and replace it with a super capacitor. The super capacitor has a 15- to 20-year service life, greater cold cranking amps and withstands greater temperature extremes than conventional starting batteries.
 
To reduce maintenance and help ensure that there is always adequate oil, we increase the engine’s oil capacity to provide for a 3,000-hour (natural gas / propane) or 1,500-hour (diesel) maintenance interval. Standard oil intervals for typical generators range from 200 to 500 hours.
 
DC Hybrid Power Systems
 
In most off-grid or bad-grid outdoor applications where DC loads are required, such as telecommunications towers in rural or remote areas, fuel costs of operating a generator can account for more than 60% of the total operating costs.

In most backup applications, such as telecommunications and uninterruptable power supply systems, lead acid batteries are used for providing transitional power while the generator starts up. In most of our prime power applications (including telecommunications) the goal is to reduce maintenance and fuel costs. Our Supra Controller™ automatically cycles the generator off when the loads are small and cycles it on again when the load increases or the battery charge is depleted. This cycling reduces engine maintenance and saves significant quantities of fuel.
 
Additional fuel savings are realized by using lithium-ion batteries in place of lead acid batteries. Lead acid batteries, when compared with lithium-ion batteries, have high internal resistance, are inherently inefficient during charging or discharging in cyclic load applications and therefore require longer to charge, resulting in higher fuel costs. In 2011, we completed the design and testing of a hybrid power system, where our DC power system was integrated with lithium-ion batteries to provide a longer life and higher fuel efficiency to cyclic DC power applications such as telecommunications towers.
 
Our DC hybrid power systems can monitor the charge/discharge cycle of either lithium-ion or lead acid batteries, or other battery types, on a cell by cell basis using our BMS. Our Supra Controller™ system incorporates a CAN bus communications capability that provides communication and control between the battery and the DC hybrid power system. Each cell in the battery pack is individually monitored for voltage and temperature, ensuring the safety and longevity of the battery bank. These power systems include enclosures, a lithium-ion battery pack, our proprietary BMS and our proprietary Supra Controller™ system that controls engine output, battery charging algorithms, cooling system and power control circuits that optimize DC load outputs.
 
DC Solar Hybrid Power Systems
 
Our DC solar hybrid power system combines our DC hybrid power system with solar photovoltaic modules and a custom engineered multi power point tracking charge controller. In most off-grid or bad-grid outdoor applications, such as telecommunications towers in rural or suburban areas, the fuel costs of operating a generator can account for more than half of the total operating costs. We believe that incorporating renewable energy sources, such as solar, with our DC hybrid power systems is ideal solution for numerous off-grid and bad-grid applications worldwide. Our DC solar hybrid power systems incorporate the following features:

● | Hybrid power panel. We produce distribution panel assemblies that make use of punched and plated buss bars to make the heavy current connections between appliances. The industry standard is using labor intensive hand crimped wires and lugs which are accomplished in the field.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Photovoltaic Arrays. Our telecommunications customers request photovoltaic array structures to withstand winds of 150 mph and 200 mph. We satisfy these requirements against the industry standard of 120 mph.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shelter. We provide an all-weather light-weight aluminum walk-in shelter that is easy to transport by truck or helicopter.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lightning protection. We provide the highest degree of lightning protection through the use of air-coil type inductors designed by us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Air-Conditioning. We provide DC air-conditioning if required in very hot weather environments. We also provide cooling systems using ambient air.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe these tools assist in reducing equipment downtime, thereby reducing the overall cost of ownership. In addition, we plan to use these tools to monitor and provide accurate billing for our rental equipment deployed at customer facilities. 
 
Aftermarket and Service Parts
 
We offer extensive aftermarket and service parts programs. We maintain an extensive inventory of aftermarket parts and sell parts directly to customers or through our qualified network of service providers. In addition, we require our regional service providers to maintain sufficient quantities of aftermarket parts in their inventory to ensure minimum downtime upon product failure.
 
We maintain accurate records of bill of materials for each serial number shipped and service our products well beyond their recommended lives. In the marketplace, our products are known for their long life and durability.
 
Product and Warranty Support
 
We offer product commissioning as an added service to all our customers and require the purchase of such services as a condition for acceptance of any warranty claims in the future. We offer installation of the equipment, preliminary testing, integration of equipment with other assets located at the site and introductory maintenance and safety training. We offer various levels of fee-based services to support our products in the field. In addition, we have trained product and application engineers that deliver high quality, responsive lifetime technical support to all our customers worldwide.
 
We further support our customers by using qualified regional independent service providers to perform warranty and aftermarket service and repair on our products. Our regional service providers are factory trained and certified prior to being authorized to repair or service our equipment. We generally reimburse regional service providers for the warranty services they perform on our systems.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales strategy focuses on using our direct sales force to market our DC backup power products to telecommunications providers in the U.S. Since 2017, we made significant investments in hiring additional sales personnel in the U.S. market to demonstrate our products to Tier-1 telecommunications providers. In 2017, we signed a national contract with an additional Tier-1 telecommunication provider which established national terms and conditions across our product line. In 2018, we started shipping DC backup power products to a third Tier-1 telecommunications customer, T-Mobile. Our products are purchased by regional centers operated by our telecommunications customers, thereby expanding our overall market into regions we may not have covered previously.
 
Since 2017, have we expanded our sales and service infrastructure in the international markets. We established regional sales offices in South Africa, U.A.E., Singapore, Poland and Dominican Republic and established sales and aftermarket service locations in Australia and Romania to locally manage South East Asia and EMEA regions, respectively. Due to a general lack of a reliable power grid, many emerging markets continue to expand their telecommunications infrastructures at a high rate. We believe that this lack of a reliable power grid, together with our knowledge of integrating renewables with generators, provides us with a opportunity to enter these emerging markets with our hybrid storage and renewable energy solutions.

We experienced a modest success in marketing our DC power products to military contractors in the U.S. We have allocated a dedicated sales force to market to government and military customers which has resulted in military sales contributing approximately 6% of the total sales during 2018.
 
We also market our products through our web site and by exhibiting our products at trade shows globally. Our primary sales are generated through product demonstrations and short-term rentals to demonstrate the capabilities of our products and value proposition to large mobile network providers worldwide. In 2018, we demonstrated our DC power systems to customers worldwide. In South East Asia, upon successful demonstration of our DC power system, we received an initial purchase order for twenty-five units from a Tier-1 telecommunications provider. We believe this strategy of demonstrating our products and technologies to prospective customers expedites the sales process for our DC power systems.
 
Distribution and Service
 
We market our products through various distribution channels that promote our products and brand and provide effective aftermarket support and service. While the majority of our sales are achieved through our direct sales force, we also utilize independent service providers and dealers to complement our global sales strategy.

Our focus on safety, quality and on-time delivery is supported by employee training and information systems that monitor process and product quality and communicate trends and findings to senior management on a real-time basis.
 
Design Engineering/Research and Development
 
Our research and development efforts are market driven and are focused on the development of new technologies and product improvements, as well as reducing costs and improving product quality and reliability. During 2017, the primary focus of our research and development activities was the development of lighter-weight, more compact and lower cost DC power generation systems for our Tier-1 wireless provider customers in the U.S. and international markets. Significant resources were expended in enhancing our system controls like our Supra Controller™ and BMS. Features such as remote monitoring and self-diagnostics were enhanced to make systems more robust and intelligent.
 
A significant part of our research and development effort has focused on the development of control software that integrates engine controls, power management and battery algorithms to fully optimize fuel consumption in both prime power and backup power generation applications. We use a high level of integration with a single control and communication module, our Supra Controller™, rather than competitive system designs with a number of independent control modules controlling a single function. Our integrated approach ensures software compatibility, reduces complexity in wiring, increases reliability and reduces cost.
 
Our research and development expenditures increased by $573,173 to $1,907,810 during 2018, as compared to $1,334,637 in 2017. This growth in expenditures is attributable to an increase in new product development activities. During 2018, we developed a 20kW DC power system, a liquid-cooled DC power system for the SMET military project, developed and introduced our next generation BMS, and a system integrating renewable energy, battery storage and DC power for remote off-grid telecommunications tower sites in Southeast Asia. The costs related to these developments included increase in engineering staff, increase direct labor costs to fabricate and assemble prototypes and production units. We maintain an in-house design, prototyping, testing and application engineering capabilities including expertise in 3-D solid modeling and finite element analysis, computer-based modeling and testing, rapid prototyping, design verification testing and document publication, which includes manufacturing assembly instructions, supplier drawings and product manuals. In addition, we utilize third party testing laboratories to certify our products compliance to current applicable UL standards.

We consider our manufacturing process to be a trade secret and have non-disclosure agreements with our employees to protect the trade secrets held by us. However, such methods may not afford complete protection, and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know-how or obtain access to our know-how and manufacturing concepts. We may register patents and trademarks in future to protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position.
 
Suppliers
 
We attempt to mitigate the material adverse effect of component shortages in our business through detail material planning and by qualifying multiple vendor sources for key components and outside processes. In order to meet our customer demands, we forecast the supply of our long lead time items such as engines, castings and electronic components through strategic planning of inventory levels. We conduct on- site supplier audits of major suppliers to help ensure reliability, quality and sustainability of critical components.
Quality Control
 
We began concentrating on our quality control in the early 1980s, much of which was required by our customers at the time, including NASA and Hughes Aircraft. In the late 1980s, we implemented the MIL-I-45208A quality control system monitored by U.S. Department of Defense, to meet prime source requirements for a contract we received from the U.S. Army Picatinny Arsenal, to design and manufacture an advanced battery and monitoring system for a security device used in nuclear munitions depots around the world. We are currently in the process of obtaining an ISO 9000 certification.
Certifications
 
Our DC generator systems comply with UL2200 safety standards. Our products also comply with applicable regulatory emission standards of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the California Air Quality Management District.
Product Warranties
 
Our standard warranty on new products is two years from the date of delivery to the customer. We offer a limited extended warranty of up to five years on our certified DC power systems based on application and usage. Under our standard warranty, provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and recovery from suppliers. Historically, we have experienced warranty costs of below 1% of net sales which we believe is well within industry norms.
Information Systems
 
We utilize integrated information systems (i.e., ERP) that link our lead management, sales planning, order entry, purchasing, engineering, production control, manufacturing, inventory and accounting systems. During the past five years we have made significant investments to upgrade and customize our information systems to improve productivity and our ability to accurately forecast inventory and manpower requirements. We plan to invest additional capital in software and information systems to integrate aftermarket sales and service with our ERP system to improve post sales customer experience with our products and services.
 
Government Regulations and Environmental matters
 
Our products and their installations are subject to oversight and regulations at federal, state and local levels in accordance with regional statutes and ordinances relating to, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and fuel connections, security protocols, and local and state licensing requirements. We are also regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. Our products integrate engines with our proprietary technologies to produce efficient DC power. We rely on our engine suppliers to conform to the regional regulations and statutes to meet regional emission requirements.
