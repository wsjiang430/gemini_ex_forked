ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K), references to the Company and to we, us, and our refer to Pivotal Acquisition Corp. 
 We are a Delaware corporation incorporated on August 2, 2018 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses in the following segments: logistics technology and last mile delivery services, business technology services, on-line cyber security and off-line physical security services, media and entertainment services and franchise businesses. 
 In August 2018, we issued to Pivotal Acquisition Holdings LLC, our sponsor, an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of Class B common stock (founder shares) in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. Our sponsor transferred 50,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors in December 2018 and transferred 100,000 founder shares to our chief financial officer in December 2018, in each case at the same per-share purchase price paid by our sponsor. 
 On February 4, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering (IPO) of 23,000,000 units, including 3,000,000 units subject to the underwriters over-allotment option. Each unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (Private Placement) of 6,350,000 warrants (Private Warrants) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $6,350,000. The Private Warrants were purchased by our sponsor. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Warrants are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchaser or its permitted transferees. The purchaser of Private Warrants has agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Warrants or Class A Common Stock underlying the Private Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 Transaction costs amounted to $13,203,283 as of March 8, 2019, consisting of $4,600,000 of underwriting fees, $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fee and $553,283 of other costs. In addition, as of March 22, 2019, $1,058,539 of IPO proceeds was held as cash outside of the trust account established in connection with the IPO and is available for working capital purposes. 
 For further details regarding our business, see the section titled Proposed Business contained in our prospectus dated January 31, 2019, incorporated by reference herein.
