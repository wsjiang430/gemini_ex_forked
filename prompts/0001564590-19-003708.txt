 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a global medical device company focused on providing innovative products that improve the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic pain.  We have developed and commercialized the Senza® spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, an evidence-based neuromodulation platform for the treatment of chronic pain. Our proprietary paresthesia-free HF10TM therapy, delivered by our Senza system, was demonstrated in our SENZA-RCT study to be superior to traditional SCS therapy with it being nearly twice as successful in treating back pain and 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain when compared to traditional SCS therapy.  Comparatively, traditional SCS therapy has limited efficacy in treating back pain and is used primarily for treating leg pain, limiting its market adoption. Our SENZA-RCT study, along with our European studies, represents what we believe is the most robust body of clinical evidence for any SCS therapy.  We believe the superiority of HF10 therapy over traditional SCS therapies will allow us to capitalize on and expand the approximately $2.4 billion existing global SCS market by treating both back and leg pain without paresthesia.
 We launched Senza commercially in the United States in May 2015, after receiving a label from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which supports the superiority of our HF10 therapy over traditional SCS.  The Senza system has been commercially available in certain European markets since November 2010 and in Australia since August 2011. We have experienced significant revenue growth in the United States since commercial launch. Senza is currently reimbursed by all of the major insurance providers. In early 2017, we commenced a controlled commercial launch of our new surgical lead, marketed as the SurpassTM surgical lead. In January 2018, we received FDA approval for our next generation Senza IITM SCS system.  The tables below set forth our revenue from U.S. and international sales the past three years on a quarterly basis and total revenue for each of the past five years.

 With a primary focus on treating leg pain, the global market for SCS therapy was estimated to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2018.  We believe the superiority of HF10 therapy over traditional SCS therapies will allow us to capitalize on and potentially help expand that market to approximately $4.0 billion by 2022 by expanding into other pain-related indications, such as upper limb and neck pain, painful diabetic neuropathy and non-surgical back pain, among others. The United States represents approximately 80% of this global market due in part to governmental reimbursement restraints in international markets. We believe that due to factors such as an aging population and an increasing number of failed back surgeries, there is continuing opportunity for an SCS therapy that effectively treats back pain to increase the size of the existing SCS market over time.
 We believe our HF10 therapy will continue to both take share of and expand the SCS therapy market due to HF10 therapy being a paresthesia-free therapy and having superior efficacy when compared to traditional SCS therapies. Traditional SCS therapy generates paresthesia, a sensation typically experienced as tingling, numbness and buzzing, which overlaps the pain area. Paresthesia is often considered unpleasant or uncomfortable, sometimes causes a shocking or jolting sensation with changes in posture and is a continuous reminder of the patient’s chronic condition. Compared to traditional SCS therapy which typically operates at 50 Hz to 60 Hz, HF10 therapy delivers spinal cord stimulation at a lower amplitude and a higher frequency waveform of 10,000 Hz. In addition, HF10 therapy relies on consistent anatomical placement of the stimulation leads across patients, thus reducing procedure variability relative to traditional SCS therapy which requires individualized lead placement to properly map

paresthesia coverage. We believe the ability of HF10 therapy to deliver pain relief without paresthesia provides a substantial benefit over traditional SCS therapy to patients and physicians.
 We believe the clinical results from our SENZA-RCT study, along with our European studies, position us with superior and compelling efficacy data. The following charts provide a comparison of HF10 therapy in both pain reduction and responder rates against the other prospective Level 1 studies conducted.

We believe we have built competitive advantages through our proprietary technology, clinical evidence base, strong track record of execution with over 40,000 patients implanted with Senza, extensive intellectual property and a proven management team with substantial neuromodulation experience. With the well-demonstrated superior efficacy of our HF10 therapy, we aim to continue to drive adoption and penetration in the U.S. market, which represents the largest opportunity in SCS, and expand patient access to HF10 therapy by investing in the development of evidence for new indications such as chronic upper limb and neck pain, painful neuropathies (including painful diabetic neuropathy) and non-surgical refractory back pain. On this front, we initiated two randomized controlled trials in 2018, SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP, which are evaluating HF10 therapy for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and non-surgical refractory back pain.
 Market Overview
 Existing Treatments for Chronic Pain and Limitations
 Chronic pain has been defined as pain that lasts longer than the time required for tissues to heal, which is often considered to be three months.  Patients who present with chronic pain are typically placed on a treatment progression plan. Initial medical management typically includes behavioral modification, exercise, physical therapy and over-the-counter analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. When early stage medical management is not sufficient for the treatment of chronic leg and back pain, patients may progress to interventional techniques including steroid injections or nerve blocks. Patients who do not respond to these more conservative treatments are considered candidates for more advanced therapies.  These more advanced therapies include spine surgery, treatment with oral opioids and SCS.  Spine surgery, while a common invasive procedure, can result in complications such as Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) a condition where pain persists despite the procedure, and spinal surgery often fails to treat certain types of chronic pain such as severe neuropathic back pain.  Oral opioids, while reducing the patient’s perception of pain, lack clinical evidence to support long-term usage and can cause multiple complications and side-effects including nausea, vomiting and dizziness.  Further, opioids present a high risk of addiction and abuse.    
Traditional Spinal Cord Stimulation and Limitations
 SCS is a type of neuromodulation technology that utilizes an implantable, pacemaker-like device to deliver electrical impulses to the spinal cord to treat chronic pain.  Traditional SCS therapy is designed to induce paresthesia, a sensation typically experienced as tingling, numbness and buzzing, which overlaps the area of pain with the intent of masking pain perception. The electrical pulses are delivered by small electrodes on leads that are placed near the spinal cord and are connected to a battery-powered generator implanted under the skin. Traditional SCS therapy is currently indicated as a treatment for chronic pain of the trunk and limbs in patients who failed conventional medical management. Traditional SCS therapy is considered to be a minimally invasive and reversible therapy that may provide greater long-term benefits over more invasive surgical approaches or opioids. The most common use for traditional SCS therapy is for neuropathic pain conditions such as FBSS.
 Traditional SCS therapy generally consists of two phases, an evaluation period, also called the trial period, which typically lasts several days, followed by a permanent implant for those patients who experience a successful trial period. The trial period involves a percutaneously placed insulated wire, called a lead, which a physician implants near the spinal cord using a needle. During the trial period, a temporary external system is used by patients and physicians for evaluating whether traditional SCS therapy is effective. If the trial period is successful, a permanent system is implanted in the patient. The success criterion is typically an approximate 50% reduction in pain during the evaluation period. For those patients that proceed to the permanent implant procedure, we believe that approximately 30% of U.S. procedures are completed using surgical leads and the remaining are completed using percutaneous leads.
 A key part of the permanent system is the implantable pulse generator (IPG) which is a miniaturized version of the external stimulator. The IPG should provide the patient with multiple years of use and can be either rechargeable or non-rechargeable. Due to payor constraints in certain European countries, the transition from primary cell IPGs to rechargeable IPGs has been slow in those markets. In the United States and Australia, the majority of IPGs implanted are rechargeable.

Traditional SCS products have required paresthesia to provide pain relief, and consequently, paresthesia coverage has been used as a surrogate metric for successful pain relief. Paresthesia is often considered unpleasant or uncomfortable and is sometimes made worse by a shocking or jolting sensation with changes in posture. Unpleasant sensations can be caused by lead movement closer to the spinal cord or away from it as the patient moves, resulting in variation in paresthesia intensity. Paresthesia is also a constant reminder of the patient’s chronic condition. Due to the distraction of paresthesia, patients with traditional SCS devices are instructed not to drive or operate machinery when the device is active. Medtronic plc (Medtronic) has released a survey showing that 71% of patients find paresthesia uncomfortable at times. As such, innovation in the SCS market has historically focused on technologies that optimize traditional SCS therapy’s ability to create more precise paresthesia fields. Even with successful paresthesia coverage, patients still may not receive pain relief or often lose pain relief after a period of time.
Traditional SCS procedures also require physicians to perform the complex and often time-consuming process of paresthesia mapping. This mapping process requires a patient to be sedated for the lead placement, then awakened and repeatedly questioned in order for the physician to assess paresthesia coverage over the patient’s area of pain and reposition and reprogram the leads to redirect the paresthesia. This process creates variability in the procedure and a complicated anesthesia management process, impacting the physician’s schedule and patient comfort. The primary objective of traditional SCS therapy is to create a stimulation program that covers the areas of pain without creating paresthesia beyond the pain areas, given that this can be uncomfortable and difficult to tolerate.
 Traditional SCS technology involves the delivery of low frequency electrical impulses, or waveforms, to the spinal cord.  Recent developments in traditional SCS have resulted in alternative waveforms, some of which are variations of low frequency waveforms at sub-threshold amplitudes aimed at reducing the reliance on paresthesia.  For example, Abbott Laboratories has developed a SCS system that offers an alternate low frequency waveform called BurstDR.  Medtronic is promoting a high-density programming approach. Additionally, Boston Scientific is now offering sub-threshold therapy at frequencies below 1.2 kHz.
 Our Solution for Chronic Pain
 HF10 Therapy
 Our HF10 therapy is designed to deliver innovative neuromodulation solutions for treating chronic pain based on what we believe to be the best clinical evidence available. By overcoming many of the limitations of traditional SCS therapy, our HF10 therapy offers superior efficacy for patients and provides significant advantages to physicians and hospitals. We believe the advantages of our proprietary HF10 therapy over traditional SCS include:

• | Demonstrated superior efficacy data for both leg and back pain: In our SENZA-RCT pivotal study, HF10 therapy was demonstrated to provide significant and sustained back pain relief in addition to leg pain relief. HF10 therapy was shown in both number of patients that respond and in treatment efficacy to be superior to traditional SCS therapy as it is nearly twice as successful in treating back pain and 1.5 times as successful in treating leg pain. Our SENZA-RCT study, along with the previously completed European studies, represent what we believe is the most robust body of clinical evidence for any SCS therapy. We believe that the superior efficacy results and robust data provided in our pivotal clinical trials will drive increased adoption of our HF10 therapy among patients, payors and providers and may enable us to gain significant market share in the approximately $2.4 billion existing global SCS market in 2018, which is primarily based on treating leg pain. In addition, we believe our efficacy data in back pain will allow us to expand the SCS market under current reimbursement regimes by meeting demand from back pain patients who are largely untreated by traditional SCS therapies.

• | Paresthesia free pain relief for patients: HF10 therapy offers the notable benefit to patients of achieving significant and sustained pain relief without paresthesia, thus enabling our patients to avoid the uncomfortable shocking or jolting sensations commonly associated with paresthesia, and removing a major barrier for many patients who may otherwise benefit from SCS therapy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anatomical lead placement for physicians. Since HF10 therapy relies on consistent anatomical lead placement, it removes the cumbersome process of paresthesia mapping that is required by traditional SCS therapy, reducing variability in the operating procedure and offering a significant benefit to both physicians and hospitals by reducing variability of procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Ability to treat a broader group of chronic pain patients: Our HF10 therapy is a platform technology that we believe can provide treatment benefits for a broader group of chronic pain indications. We are currently investigating the use of HF10 therapy to address additional indications such as chronic upper limb and neck pain, painful neuropathies and non-surgical refractory back pain. Based on analysis from our SENZA-RCT and European studies, we believe HF10 therapy may be an attractive treatment option for some non-surgical refractory back pain patients due to its cost, reversibility and initial trial period. Due to the removal of paresthesia, HF10 may also be an effective therapy for patients with chronic upper limb and neck pain as it will not create the intense discomfort that traditional SCS generates for patients with chronic upper limb and neck pain when leads are placed in the cervical spine.

Our Growth Strategy
 Our mission is to be the neuromodulation leader in the treatment of chronic pain by developing innovative, evidence-based solutions. To accomplish this objective we intend to:

• | Drive adoption of HF10 therapy through a world-class sales and marketing organization: We will continue to build our worldwide sales organization consisting of direct sales representatives and, in some international markets, a network of distributors and sales agents. In particular, we are continuing to make significant investments in building our U.S. commercial infrastructure and sales force. This is a lengthy process that requires significant investment to recruit and train qualified sales representatives. Following initial training for Senza, our sales representatives typically require lead time in the field to grow their network of accounts and produce sales results. Successfully recruiting and training a sufficient number of productive sales representatives is required to achieve our expected growth rate. Our sales representatives target physician specialties involved in SCS treatment decisions, including neurosurgeons, physiatrists, interventional pain specialists and orthopedic spine surgeons. Further, we expect that our direct sales force will target the approximately 2,400 hospitals and outpatient surgery centers at which we believe an estimated 90% of SCS procedures in the United States are performed. To complement our sales representatives, we intend for our marketing and reimbursement teams to drive HF10 therapy adoption through creating awareness and demand among additional stakeholders involved in the SCS treatment decision, including third-party payors, hospital administrators, and patients and their families. Internationally, we plan to increase coverage in certain of our existing markets by continuing the expansion of our direct sales force.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the existing SCS market by treating back pain: We believe we are expanding the existing SCS market by delivering a system that provides meaningful treatment for chronic back pain, which we believe represents a significant opportunity in the global SCS market. With traditional SCS therapy, patients who experience predominant back pain are associated with lower levels of treatment success. Consequently, patients with back pain are typically not recommended for treatment with traditional SCS therapy due to the difficulty of achieving and maintaining pain coverage. In contrast to traditional SCS therapy, we believe HF10 therapy is positioned to expand the existing SCS market by effectively treating back pain in addition to leg pain.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Communicate the clinically demonstrated, superior efficacy of HF10 therapy to patients, physicians and payors globally: Given our robust clinical evidence that demonstrates the superior efficacy of our HF10 therapy, we believe we will be able to position our therapy with patients, providers and payors in a differentiated way. Given that our SENZA-RCT pivotal study has demonstrated superiority for both back and leg pain in a head-to-head comparison with traditional SCS, we are able to differentiate HF10 therapy by communicating its superior clinical benefits and advantages to patients, physicians and payors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in research and development to drive innovation: We are extending our novel and proprietary technologies into a series of product enhancements with the goal of improving the treatment of chronic pain. Product enhancements have recently included a next-generation IPG and enhanced MRI capability, both of which were approved in Europe in 2017, with the next-generation IPG, or Senza II, gaining approval by the FDA in January 2018. We also expect to continue developing enhancements to Senza to further increase performance and introduce new benefits including next generation IPGs and enhanced MRI capabilities. We believe that further product enhancements if and when completed will

drive continued adoption of our technology platform and further validate the advantages and benefits of our HF10 therapy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale our business to achieve cost and production efficiencies: We plan to improve the efficiency of our third-party manufacturing processes, which we believe will lower our per unit manufacturing cost. We expect to continue to scale our manufacturing operations as we expand Senza sales volumes in the United States.

Growth Opportunities in Other Chronic Pain Indications
 We plan to use our platform technology to generate evidence on HF10 therapy for use in other chronic pain indications, including chronic upper limb and neck pain, non-surgical back pain, and painful neuropathies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating evidence for HF10 therapy in other indications or in receiving additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement coverage to promote Senza and HF10 therapy for use in other indications. Below are three areas where preliminary results have been promising:
Chronic Upper Limb and Neck Pain
 Chronic neck pain with or without upper limb pain is prevalent in 48% of women and 38% of men in the general adult population, with persistent complaints in 22% of women and 16% of men. Multiple treatments currently exist in the market today, such as epidural injections, but there is a lack of clinically efficacious treatments for some patients. In addition, there has been a very small body of evidence published on the application of SCS in chronic neck pain and upper limb pain by placing the leads in the cervical spine. The evidence has suggested limited therapeutic response when traditional SCS therapy is used, where the paresthesia in the cervical spine associated with traditional SCS therapy can create intolerable discomfort, limiting its viability. We believe Senza can overcome this barrier due to its ability to deliver pain relief without paresthesia, combined with its demonstrated superior efficacy relative to the traditional SCS for back and leg pain. The results from our SENZA Upper Limb and Neck study, which were presented at the North America Neuromodulation Society (NANS) conference in January 2019, demonstrated a 76% responder rate for neck pain (n=42) and 83% for upper limb pain (n=24) at three months, the primary endpoint. At twelve months, the responder rate was 89% for neck pain (n=37) and 95% for upper limb pain (n=20).  Further, average neck pain scores (as measured on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)) declined from 7.6 (n=42) at baseline to 2.4 (n=42) at three months and 1.5 (n=37) at twelve months. For upper limb pain, average VAS scores declined from 7.1 (n=19) at baseline to 1.8 (n=24) at three months and 1.0 (n=20) at twelve months.
Non-Surgical Back Pain
 One of the most common uses for SCS is for neuropathic pain conditions such as FBSS. The incidence of patients that will develop FBSS following lumbar spinal surgery is estimated to be within the range of 10% to 40%. However, in addition to having applicability for treating FBSS patients, there is a potential for SCS to provide benefit for patients suffering from chronic pain who are not surgical candidates.  HF10 therapy could provide an attractive treatment option for these patients, as a subset analysis of non-surgical patients from our SENZA-RCT and European studies, respectively, found a decrease in back pain VAS scores from 7.2 to 2.5 (12 months, n=11) and 8.1 to 3.4 (24 months, n=14), as well as a decrease in leg pain VAS scores from 7.1 to 2.3 (12 months, n=11) and 5.9 to 2.8 (24 months, n=14). More recent results in patients who were not candidates for major spine surgery and treated with HF10 therapy in a study led by Dr. Adnan Al-Kaisy demonstrated similar promising results. In this study, patients experienced reduced back pain VAS and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores from baseline of 87% and 63% respectively at 36 months (n=17). In addition to pain reduction and reduced disability, a reduction in opioid use was observed with 90% of the patients using opioids at the start of the study compared to 12% at the end of the study. The results of this study led to the initiation of the SENZA-NSRBP RCT which will compare HF10 therapy delivered in conjunction with conventional medical management (CMM) to CMM alone in non-surgical refractory back pain (NSRBP) patients.
Painful Neuropathies
 The American Chronic Pain Association estimates that more than 15 million people in the United States and Europe have some degree of neuropathic pain. More than two out of every 100 people are estimated to have 
 6


peripheral neuropathy, with the incidence rate increasing to eight in every 100 for people aged 55 or older. The diminished quality of life and increased disability associated with peripheral neuropathy results in significant workforce and healthcare costs. Various treatments currently exist, but have limited efficacy. As such, we have initiated an initial study to determine if HF10 therapy could help this patient group. Results of a prospective, multicenter feasibility study treating chronic intractable pain of the limbs from peripheral polyneuropathy using HF10 therapy demonstrated a decrease in mean VAS pain score from 7.5 at baseline (N=18) to 1.9 at three months post-implant (the primary endpoint), 2.8 at twelve months and 1.4 at twenty-four months.  Subject deemed responders was 78% at three months, 69% at twelve months and 88% at twenty-four months (presented at NANS in January 2019). The results from this study led to the initiation of the SENZA-PDN RCT which will compare HF10 therapy combined with conventional medical management (CMM) to CMM alone for patients suffering from painful diabetic neuropathy.
 The results we have seen in these chronic pain conditions are consistent with those of our back and leg pain results as seen in the below chart. These initial results led to the initiation of the SENZA-NSRPB and SENZA-PDN RCTs to further build the evidence base for these pain etiologies.

• | Two-thirds of HF10 therapy patients had a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 for back pain at three months (which we define as achieving remitter status), which is nearly twice the number of traditional SCS therapy patients (35%) with a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5, results that were statistically superior. The superiority of HF10 therapy for achieving remitter status for back pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study.

• | Two-thirds of HF10 therapy patients had a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5 on a scale of 0 to 10 for leg pain at three months, a much greater number than traditional SCS therapy patients (40%) with a VAS pain score of less than or equal to 2.5, results that were statistically superior. The superiority of HF10 therapy for achieving remitter status for leg pain was maintained through the 24-month follow-up period of the study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety outcomes were consistent across the treatment groups, with the exception of uncomfortable paresthesia in traditional SCS patients, which was not in HF10 therapy patients.

 The results from the clinical studies have been consistent across studies and across outcome measures. Our initial prospective multicenter European clinical study (the EU study) were consistent with our subsequent findings in our prospective, comparative, randomized, controlled U.S. pivotal study (SENZA-RCT study). In the two-year follow up of the EU study, average back pain VAS was reduced from 8.4 at baseline to 2.8 at 12 months to 3.3 at 24 months. Average leg pain was reduced from 5.4 VAS pain level at baseline to 2.0 at 12 months to 2.3 at 24 months. Additionally, for responder rates, 60% of the implanted patients had at least 50% back pain relief and 71% had at least 50% leg pain relief. Disability as measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) improved by an average of 15 points at 24 months, a clinically and statistically significant improvement. The following table summarizes key outcomes for implanted subjects in our EU and SENZA-RCT studies.

 Our SENZA-RCT pivotal study was a prospective, randomized, multi-center study, conducted across 11 U.S. clinical trial sites, comparing the safety and effectiveness of Senza delivering HF10 therapy, which we refer to as the test to Boston Scientific’s FDA-approved Precision Plus system, delivering traditional SCS therapy, which we refer to as the control. Each included patient was required to have a leg and back pain VAS score of at least 5. Among the 198 chronic pain patients who were randomized for treatments, 171 had a successful therapy evaluation phase, or trial phase, and were implanted with an SCS system. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial and met its primary and secondary endpoints. Statistical analysis also demonstrates the superior efficacy of HF10 therapy over traditional SCS therapy for all primary and secondary endpoints. 
 The 12-month outcomes for HF10 therapy in our SENZA-RCT pivotal study were published in Anesthesiology and are consistent with the outcomes from our European clinical study, the two year results of which have been published in the Pain Medicine journal of the American Academy of Pain Medicine. The 24-month SENZA-RCT results were presented in December 2015 at the annual meeting of the North American Neuromodulation Society, showing sustained superiority of HF10 therapy compared with traditional SCS in treating both back and leg pain over the 24-month follow-up period. The 24-month outcomes in our SENZA-RCT pivotal study were published in Neurosurgery.
 Patients with chronic pain are generally classified by physicians based on the location of their pain, for example whether their worst pain is predominant back, predominant leg, mixed back and leg, upper limb, neck or other. The adoption of SCS to date has been driven primarily by the treatment of patients whose worst pain is in their legs and for whom other treatment approaches have failed. We believe that broader utilization of traditional SCS therapy has been restrained by the lack of prospective randomized clinical evidence supporting SCS broadly and, in particular, demonstrating an ability to treat back pain.
 Safety Data (EU and RCT Studies)
 Safety results of our SENZA-RCT pivotal study were generally consistent between the test and control groups. Study-related serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 4.0% of HF10 therapy subjects (n=4) compared with 7.2% of traditional SCS therapy subjects (n=7; p = 0.37). In addition to the SAEs described above, there were two deaths, one of which was study-related and resulted from a myocardial infarction of a subject randomized to traditional SCS therapy that occurred during the implant procedure. The other death occurred outside the study period in the test group and resulted from a malignant hepatic neoplasm. The most common study-related AEs were implant site pain (in 11.9% of HF10 therapy and 10.3% of traditional SCS therapy subjects) and uncomfortable paresthesia (in 11.3% of traditional SCS therapy subjects and in no HF10 therapy subjects). Lead migration leading to revision occurred in 3.0% of HF10 therapy and 5.2% of traditional SCS therapy participants. Importantly, 
 9


neurological assessment revealed no stimulation-related neurological deficits in either treatment group. Also, there were no stimulation-related SAEs in either arm.
 Safety results of our EU study demonstrated no evidence of neurologic deficit or dysfunction attributable to prolonged delivery of HF10 therapy. Further, investigators reported that adverse events were similar in nature and frequency to those seen with traditional SCS therapy. The most common adverse events in both arms of the study were implant site pain, infection and lead migration.
 Our Senza System
 The Senza system is approved to create electrical impulses from 2 Hz to 10,000 Hz, including our proprietary HF10 therapy, which allows for pain relief without paresthesia. HF10 therapy delivers proprietary waveforms at 10,000 Hz pulse rate with a statistically driven and clinically verified programming algorithm.
 Senza, similar to other commercially available SCS systems, consists of leads, a trial stimulator, an IPG, surgical tools, a clinician laptop programmer, a patient remote control and a mobile charger. These components enable physicians to implant the leads and the IPG, and patients to operate the system.
 
Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG): The IPG contains a rechargeable battery and electronics that deliver electrical pulses to the lead. It can connect to one or two leads, and up to 16 electrodes. It is a programmable device and can deliver the required customized programs for each patient. The IPG is rechargeable and is placed surgically under the skin, usually above the buttock or the abdomen. The Senza and Senza II SCS systems are CE Marked and FDA-approved with labeling for “at least a 10 year battery life”. The Senza II SCS system received CE Mark clearance in Europe in November of 2017 and FDA approval in January of 2018.
Percutaneous Leads: The percutaneous leads vary in length and are thin, insulated medical wires in a cylindrical, flexible and steerable shape that conduct electrical pulses from the IPG to near the spinal cord. The insertion of the percutaneous leads can also be minimally invasive as they can be inserted in the epidural space through a needle.
 10



Surpass Surgical Leads: The Surpass surgical leads are similar to our percutaneous leads but in a larger paddle-shaped format that provides a larger surface area that broadens exposure of the lead along the vertebrae. Our Surpass surgical leads received initial approval from the FDA in late 2016 with a further approval received in January 2017 and we commenced a controlled commercial launch in early 2017.   We believe the availability of Surpass leads gives us access to up to approximately 30% of the U.S. SCS market that we previously did not address without a surgical lead.
Trial Stimulator: The trial stimulator contains electronics that deliver electrical pulses to the lead. It is an external device that is worn around the waist during the evaluation period that typically lasts several days. It is powered by batteries.
 Surgical Tools: Surgical tools include percutaneous insertion needles that are used to introduce the lead into the epidural space, a variety of stylets that give physicians the ability to steer and deliver the lead to the desired location, anchors to secure the leads and tunneling tools that provide access from the lead insertion site to the location of the IPG.
 Programmer: The clinician laptop programmer contains proprietary software that allows the customized per patient programming of the IPG. It can non-invasively interrogate the IPG and transmit programming information and download diagnostic information.
 Patient Remote Control: The patient remote control is a handheld device that allows patients to turn their stimulation on and off and change programs uploaded to their IPG.
 Charger: The charger recharges the IPG from outside the body. To charge, the charging coil of the charger is placed over the location of the IPG and then initiated by pushing a button on the charger. The charger is mobile and can be worn around the waist using a belt when charging is needed, so that the patient can perform various tasks while charging. Charging sessions are usually performed daily and are expected to average approximately 45 minutes a day.

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States, the primary purchasers of Senza are hospitals, outpatient surgery centers and physician offices. These purchasers bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans for the healthcare services associated with the SCS procedure. Government agencies and private payors determine whether to provide coverage for specific procedures. In the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs (the latter, along with applicable state governments). As the single largest payor, this program has a significant impact on other payors’ payment systems.
 Generally, reimbursement for services performed at a hospital or outpatient surgery center are reported using billing codes issued by the American Medical Association (AMA) known as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered.  Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APCs) used to determine the Medicare payment amount for services provided. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, known as ICD-10-PCS codes on and after October 1, 2015. In the United States, CMS approved a transitional pass-through payment for High-Frequency Stimulation under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system effective January 1, 2016 and expired December 31, 2017, assigning a new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II billing code to describe High-Frequency Stimulation.  This pass-through payment for HF10 therapy was in addition to the established reimbursement for spinal cord stimulation implant procedures and devices.  CMS determined that the Senza SCS System delivering HF10 therapy met the criteria for a new transitional pass-through device category based on evidence submitted from our SENZA-RCT study. We believe that SCS procedures using Senza are adequately described by existing CPT, HCPCS II and ICD-10-PCS codes for the implantation of spinal cord stimulators and related leads performed in various sites of care.
 Medicare reimbursement rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., hospital outpatient department or outpatient surgery centers) and other factors. Although private payors’ coverage policies and reimbursement rates can differ significantly from payor to payor, the Medicare program is frequently used as a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare items and services, including SCS procedures. For example, certain regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans previously denied coverage for Senza on the basis that high-frequency neuromodulation is investigational and/or experimental. We continue to engage in efforts to convince such payors of the advantages of HF10 therapy, however, there can be no assurances that we are successful in overturning any negative coverage decisions by private health insurance plans, should they arise. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained.
 Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval beyond what we have today in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.

Product Development and Research Development
 Our objective is to continue to improve patient outcomes and further expand patient access to HF10 therapy through enhancements to Senza and the development of new indications. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $33.7 million, $37.6 million and $48.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
 Since the launch of the initial Senza system, we have introduced a number of product enhancements. These include a short-tip version of the lead, new lengths of the lead, an active anchor with improved performance over silicon anchors, a second generation active anchor with smaller volume, lead adaptors that allow use of competitor leads already implanted in patients, second generation clinician programmer software, a second and third generation IPG with improved shape and compatibility for scans of the head and extremities with both 1.5 and 3 Tesla (T) MRI machines, conditional full body MRI approval for our Senza 1000 and 1500 IPG systems in Europe and Australia, and our Surpass surgical lead to complement our percutaneous lead. We also expect to continue developing enhancements to Senza to further increase performance and introduce new benefits including next generation IPGs and enhanced MRI capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or in receiving any required regulatory approvals.
 Sales and Marketing
 United States
 In 2018, we continued to grow our U.S. sales organization, which represents our main channel to communicate with our customers. Our sales representatives target physician specialties involved in SCS treatment decisions, including neurosurgeons, physiatrists, interventional pain specialists and orthopedic spine surgeons. In addition, our commercial team plans to continue to create demand for Senza among additional stakeholders involved in the SCS treatment decision, including third-party payors, hospitals administrators and SCS patients and their families. We have also developed a clinical support team in order to provide ongoing support to physicians and patients for the use of Senza.
International
 We sell Senza in Europe and Australia through a combination of our direct sales force and a network of sales agents and independent distributors. We began our direct sales operations in the United Kingdom in late 2010 and to date have expanded our direct sales operations to Austria, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. We utilize sales agents and independent distributors to sell in an additional seven countries.
Competition
 We compete in the SCS market for chronic pain. We also compete with spine surgeries, in particular re-operations. Currently, our major competitors are Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories, who have obtained regulatory approval for SCS systems. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market are:

• | Sales force experience and access
--+----------------------------------


• | Published clinical efficacy data
--+---------------------------------


• | Product support and service
--+----------------------------


• | Effective marketing and education
--+----------------------------------


• | Company brand recognition
--+--------------------------


• | Clinical research leadership
--+-----------------------------


• | Technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pricing and reimbursement
--+--------------------------

 13


 
• | Product reliability, safety and durability
--+-------------------------------------------


• | Ease of use
--+------------


• | Physician advocacy and support
--+-------------------------------

 Many of our competitors have greater capital resources, more established operations, longer commercial histories and more extensive relationships with physicians. They also have wider product offerings within neuromodulation and in other product categories, providing them with greater supplier power and with more opportunities to interact with stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions. We also face competition to recruit and retain qualified sales and other personnel.
 We expect our competitors to launch new products and release additional clinical evidence within the next few years. For example, Abbott Laboratories received FDA approval for a SCS system that offers an alternate low frequency waveform called BurstDR, and in February 2016, the company gained approval for a neuromodulation system that stimulates the dorsal root ganglion for treatment of focal pain and complex regional pain syndrome, in each case, using pivotal clinical studies for each therapy to support the FDA approval process.  Medtronic is performing studies to collect data on existing SCS products for back pain and also testing their high-density programming approach. Additionally, Boston Scientific has commenced a randomized clinical trial of a high-frequency SCS therapy in their Accelerate study and has also presented the results of a sub-threshold therapy through their Whisper study. Additionally, there are a number of emerging competitors at various stages of development. Stimwave has developed and is commercializing a minimally invasive stimulation system that employs an externally worn power source and radio frequency transmitter.  Nalu Medical, Inc. (Nalu Medical) and Neuspera Medical Inc. (Neuspera Medical) are also pursuing a similar approach as well.  Saluda is developing and testing a low frequency closed loop system for the treatment of chronic pain.  In November 2015, Nuvectra, a company that was spun-off from Greatbatch, received FDA approval for its SCS system, which is similar to many of the other traditional SCS systems currently on the market.
 Intellectual Property
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology and products, proprietary processes and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned 170 issued patents globally, of which 105 were issued U.S. utility patents, 2 were issued U.S. design patents, 34 were issued Australian utility patents, one was an Australian design patent, 14 were issued European utility patents, one was a European design patent, 5 were issued German Utility Models, 3 were issued Japanese patents, one was an issued Korean utility patent, one was an issued Korean design patent, two were issued Chinese utility patents and one was an issued Chinese design patent. In general, our patents cover SCS systems that are configured to generate non-paresthesia producing therapy signals at frequencies between 1,500 Hz to 100,000 Hz, as well as additional aspects, algorithms and components of the Senza system and HF10 therapy. As of December 31, 2018, we held 134 patent applications pending globally, of which 73 were patent applications pending in the United States, and 58 were patent applications pending across Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, China and Korea. We also have an exclusive license from the Mayo Foundation to two U.S. issued patents and one U.S. pending patent application. All of our current issued patents are projected to expire between 2028 and 2038.
 As of December 31, 2018, our trademark portfolio contained 29 trademark registrations, of which there were 6 U.S. trademark registrations, 7 Australian trademark registrations, 8 European trademark registrations, one U.K. trademark registration, 2 Japanese trademark registrations, one Norwegian trademark registration, 2 Swiss trademark 
 14


registration and 2 Turkish trademark registrations.  Our trademark portfolio also contained 8 pending applications, of which 3 are pending U.S. trademark applications and 5 are pending foreign trademark applications.
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional or priority patent application. We cannot assure that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or proprietary technologies may be alleged to infringe.
 There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using Senza, any of which could severely harm our business.
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment.
 The Mayo License
 In October 2006, we entered into a license agreement (the Mayo License) with the Venturi Group, LLC (VGL) and the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (the Mayo Foundation) pursuant to which the Mayo Foundation committed to confer with us exclusively to develop products for the treatment of autonomic and peripheral nervous system disorders, including pain, using devices to modulate nerve signaling, and non-exclusively to test such devices, and VGL committed to confer with us non-exclusively to develop such devices, and exclusively to test such devices. These commitments to confer expired in January 2011. We were granted a worldwide license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products incorporating or using the know-how developed for and provided to us by the Mayo Foundation or VGL in the course of such development and testing activities, exclusively for product development and non-exclusively for product testing. Pursuant to the Mayo License, we are obligated to pay royalties in the low single digits to the Mayo Foundation, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products, subject to reduction under certain circumstances. We are also required under the Mayo License to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize licensed products.
 The Mayo License terminates upon the expiration of (1) the last to expire of the licensed patents or (2) our obligation to pay royalties, whichever is later. We, the Mayo Foundation or VGL may terminate the Mayo License upon 60 days’ notice of a party’s material breach if such breach remains uncured after such 60-day period. 
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We rely upon third-party suppliers for the manufacture and assembly of our Senza SCS system and its components, some of which are single- or sole-sources of the relevant product component. We have not yet identified and qualified second-source replacements for several of our critical single-source suppliers. Thus, in the event that our relationship with any of our single- or sole-source suppliers terminates in the future, we may have difficulty maintaining sufficient production of our products at the standards we require. Where practicable, we seek out and validate second-source manufacturers for our single-source components. We believe that existing third-party 
 15


facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture the Senza SCS system components ourselves.
 We believe our manufacturing operations, and those of our suppliers, are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or their component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. For products distributed in the United States, we are required to manufacture any products that we sell in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR) which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications: Quality Management System ISO13485, Full Quality Assurance Certification for the design and manufacture of spinal cord stimulator systems and accessories and a Design Examination certificate for Implantable Pulse Generator and Accessories. We are required to demonstrate continuing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain these certifications and will continue to be periodically inspected by international regulatory authorities for certification purposes.
 Our material supply contracts are as follows:
 Pro-Tech Design and Manufacturing
 In July 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Pro-Tech Design and Manufacturing, Inc. (Pro-Tech) pursuant to which Pro-Tech, as a single-source supplier, conducts the inspection, labeling, packaging and sterilization of our Senza SCS system. Our supply agreement is scheduled to expire in July 2019, unless terminated earlier. We may terminate the agreement without cause upon six months’ prior written notice, and Pro-Tech may terminate without cause upon 18 months’ prior written notice. In addition, we and Pro-Tech have the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event of the other party’s material breach that remains uncured at the end of such 30-day period.
 Stellar Technologies
 On July 1, 2009, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Stellar Technologies, Inc. (Stellar) our single-source supplier of our percutaneous leads, percutaneous lead extenders and surgical leads for our neurological stimulator products. On June 30, 2014, the agreement’s initial term expired, and the agreement automatically renewed for the first time. On July 1, 2014, we entered into a first amendment to the manufacturing agreement with Stellar, which provides for an additional five year term commencing from the date of the amendment, after which the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of intent not to renew at least 30 days before the expiration of the then-current term. On January 28, 2016, we entered into a second amendment to this agreement, which provides for the purchase of certain supplementary products pursuant to the agreement. We refer to the manufacturing agreement as amended by the first and second amendments as the Stellar Agreement.
 Either we or Stellar may terminate the Stellar Agreement at will upon one year’s advance notice, subject to certain remaining rights and payment obligations, including an early cancellation fee payable by us to Stellar. We may also terminate the Stellar Agreement if Stellar is unable to perform its obligations under the Stellar Agreement for 60 days or more, or if Stellar is unwilling to perform its obligations under the Stellar Agreement and does not cure such defect within 60 days of our providing written notice to cure. Stellar may terminate the Stellar Agreement in the event of our default of certain specified obligations, including our payment obligations, material violation of a warranty or law, our material breach, and our insolvency.
 CCC Supply Agreement
 We rely upon C.C.C. Del Uruguay S.A. (CCC) a subsidiary of Greatbatch Ltd., as one of our manufacturers of our IPGs. In April 2012, we entered into our original supply agreement with CCC, which we later amended in March 2013, June 2014 and November 2016. On November 15, 2016, we entered into a new multi-year supply agreement with CCC, pursuant to which CCC agreed to a revised arrangement with regard to the manufacture and 
 16


supply of our IPGs. The agreement is effective as of November 11, 2016 and, pursuant to its terms, terminated our existing supply agreement with CCC entered into on March 13, 2015.
 The agreement continues for ten years unless terminated earlier. The term of the agreement automatically renews for additional two-year terms unless one party provides the other party with written notice of termination at least one year prior to the end of the initial term or the applicable renewal period. In the event of a change of control of CCC, the agreement may be terminated by us upon three years’ written notice to CCC, provided that such notice period shall be one year in the event CCC is acquired by certain competitors to us. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party, with written notice, upon the other party’s cessation of business or other termination of its business operations, uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. Upon termination of the agreement, CCC shall, subject to certain exceptions and unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, fulfill all purchase orders placed by us and accepted by CCC prior to the effective date of termination.
 The agreement contains, among other provisions, customary representations and warranties by the parties, ordering and payment and shipping terms, customary provisions with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property created during the term of the agreement, certain indemnification rights in favor of both parties, limitations of liability and customary confidentiality provisions.
 EaglePicher Medical Power Supply Agreement
 In April 2009, we entered into a product supply and development agreement with EaglePicher Medical Power LLC (EaglePicher) our single-source supplier of the batteries and related products for our IPG. Pursuant to the agreement, EaglePicher must use its best efforts to supply these batteries and related products in sufficient quantity to meet our demand. The agreement also provides that, upon our written request, EaglePicher will conduct development of a modified version of these products to our specifications, if we so desire. The initial term of our supply agreement with EaglePicher expired in November 2010, and the term had been automatically renewing for successive one-year periods.
 In March 2015, we entered into a first amendment to the product supply and development agreement with EaglePicher. The amendment committed us to specified minimum purchase amounts until the end of 2017 and adjusts EaglePicher’s production capacity and facilities commitments under the agreement as well as certain pricing, purchasing, delivery and cancellation terms. The amendment also extends the term of the agreement to December 31, 2019, with an additional two-year automatic renewal period unless we or EaglePicher provide notice of intent not to renew prior to the commencement of such renewal term. The amendment further provides us with the right to place a final order with EaglePicher following termination of the agreement, as amended and modifies certain warranty and assignment terms and the parties’ limitations of liability.
 In November 2015, we entered into a second amendment to the agreement, which increased our pre-existing specified minimum purchase amounts and increased EaglePicher’s production capacity commitments under the agreement, as well as specifying certain purchasing and purchase order protocols.  The amendment obligated EaglePicher to establish and qualify an additional battery production operation and commits us to fund approximately $1.0 million of such production operation paid in three milestone installments.  The amendment also establishes EaglePicher as our exclusive battery supplier through the initial five-year term of the agreement, ending December 31, 2019.
 In September 2017, we entered into a third amendment to the agreement, which changed the renewal term of the agreement such that the agreement will automatically renew for a period of one year unless we or EaglePicher provides notice of intent to terminate the agreement six months prior to the commencement of such renewal term.
 Vention Supply Agreement
 In December 2015, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Vention Medical Design and Development, Inc. (Vention) pursuant to which Vention agreed to manufacture and supply our IPGs. We are 
 17


obligated to purchase from Vention specified minimum purchase quantities of IPGs for the duration of the Vention agreement.
 The agreement continues for five years unless terminated earlier. The term of the agreement automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless one party provides the other party with written notice of termination at least one year prior to the end of the applicable renewal period. The agreement may be terminated by us for any reason upon 180 days’ written notice to Vention. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, or by either party, with written notice, upon uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. Upon termination of the agreement, Vention shall, upon our request, manufacture an additional 24 months of continuous supply of IPGs based on the preceding forecast average or such other amount as agreed upon by the parties.
 In September 2017, we entered into a first amendment to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Vention, which changed the unit costs of the products supplied by Vention.  In April 2018, we entered into a second amendment to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, which acknowledged that Vention changed its name to Nordson MEDICAL Design and Development, Inc (Nordson) and which changed the unit cost of the products supplied by Nordson.
 Other Suppliers
 We also have other suppliers, including some sole-source suppliers, for certain of our components, with whom we do not have agreements.
 Product Liability and Insurance
 The manufacture and sale of our products subjects us to the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims. Our products are used in situations in which there is a risk of serious injury or death. We carry insurance policies which we believe to be customary for similar companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that these policies will be sufficient to cover all or substantially all losses that we experience.
 We endeavor to maintain executive and organization liability insurance in a form and with aggregate coverage limits that we believe are adequate for our business purposes, but our coverage limits may prove not to be adequate in some circumstances.
 Government Regulations
 United States
 Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and its implementing regulations, guidances, and standards. The FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, and production of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
 Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, 
 18


advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
 Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. A legally marketed device is defined by statute to mean a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements in the form of a premarket approval (PMA).
 A Class III device includes devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to a device that has a new intended use or utilizes advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general and special controls. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Submission and FDA approval of a PMA application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed.
 PMA Approval
 The Senza SCS system is a Class III device subject to review and approval through the PMA pathway. PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must also include, among other things, a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device and proposed labeling. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees.
 The FDA has 45 days from its receipt of a PMA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has 180-days to review a PMA application that has been filed by the FDA, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant and/or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 The timing of FDA review of an initial PMA application can vary substantially and, in some cases, require several years to complete. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
  
• | it is not demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the manufacturing process, methods, controls or facilities used for the manufacture, processing, packing or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data is then submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.  In May 2015, we received approval for our PMA application for the Senza SCS system.
 Approval by the FDA of new PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data.  For example, if we seek approval to expand the label of Senza to include additional pain indications, we anticipate that we will be required to submit and receive approval for a PMA supplement.
 Clinical Studies
 In the United States, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require compliance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations. For a device that presents a “significant risk” to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial, as well as obtain approval of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution where the study will be conducted. If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE approval from FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required, though the sponsor must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements, such as protection of human subjects and informed consent. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices. The FDA or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Continuing Regulation
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; the reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk of health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur. Manufacturers are also required to register and list their devices with the FDA, based on which the FDA will conduct inspections to ensure continued compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters; fines; injunctions; consent decrees; civil penalties; repairs, replacements or refunds; recalls, corrections or seizures of products; total or partial suspension of production; the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals; withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications; and criminal prosecution. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

International
 Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. In addition, the FDA must be notified of, or approve the export to certain countries of devices that require a PMA, and not yet approved in the United States.
 In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, we need to comply with the requirements of the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (AIMDD) and appropriately affix the CE Mark on our products to attest to such compliance. To achieve compliance, our products must meet the “Essential Requirements” laid down in Annex I of the AIMDD relating to safety and performance. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. The assessment of the conformity of Senza has been certified by our Notified Body (the British Standards Institution, or BSI).
 As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and that any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. With respect to active implantable medical devices or Class III devices, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless reliance on existing clinical data from equivalent devices can be justified. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, Senza must continue to comply with the requirements of certain EU Directives.
 We are subject to continued surveillance by our Notified Body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. We also must comply with additional requirements of individual countries in which our products are marketed.
 The assessment of the conformity of Senza with the AIMDD and the Radio and Telecommunications Terminal (R&TTE) Directive has been certified by the BSI.
 In April 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, 
 21


transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once applicable, the Medical Devices Regulation may impose increased compliance obligations for us to access the EU market.  
 Other Regulations
 We are also subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation in the jurisdictions in which we will conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, applicable anti-kickback, false claims, physician sunshine and patient privacy and security laws and regulations.
 Anti-Kickback Statute: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act: The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the civil False Claims Act in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any 
 22


amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Penalties for a federal civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties that range, as of August 1, 2016, from approximately $10,781 to $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and criminal liability. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 EU Data Protection Laws: We are subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time. 
 For example, the EU Data Protection Directive, as implemented into national laws by the EU member states, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the processing of personal data. The new EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered into force in May 2016 and became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the current data protection laws of each EU member state. The GDPR will implement more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, more robust rights for individuals over their personal data and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase, and harm our business and financial condition. 
 We are also subject to evolving EU laws on data export, as we may transfer personal data from the EU to other jurisdictions. For example, in 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. EU and U.S. negotiators agreed in February 2016 to a new framework, the Privacy Shield, which would replace the Safe Harbor framework. However, this framework is under review and there is currently litigation challenging other EU mechanisms for adequate data transfers (e.g. the standard contractual clauses). It is uncertain whether the Privacy Shield framework and/or the standard contractual clauses will be similarly invalidated by the European courts. We rely on a mixture of mechanisms to transfer personal data from our EU business to the U.S., and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by European regulators under the GDPR, as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the European courts.

In recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising. In the EU, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a user’s device. The current EU laws that cover the use of cookies and similar technology and marketing online or by electronic means are under reform. A draft of the new ePrivacy Regulation is currently going through the European legislative process.  Unlike the current ePrivacy Directive, the ePrivacy Regulation will be directly implemented into the laws of each of the EU member States, without the need for further enactment. When implemented, it is expected to alter rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising and to impose stricter requirements on companies using these tools.  The current provisions of the draft ePrivacy Regulation also extend the strict opt-in marketing rules to business-to-business communications, and significantly increase penalties.
 Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations including by European Data Protection Authorities, fines and penalties (for example, of up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) under the GDPR and draft ePrivacy Regulation), litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Analogous State and Foreign Law Equivalents:  We may be subject to state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Healthcare Reform: In March 2010 the Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was signed into law, which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the medical device industry. The Affordable Care Act impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013. In December 2015, Former President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 are exempt from the medical device excise tax. As part of continuing resolution legislation signed by the U.S. President and passed by Congress in January 2018, the medical device excise tax moratorium was further extended until January 1, 2020.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (MACRA), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments scheduled to begin in 2019 that are based on various 
 24


performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations.
 There have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In addition, Congress could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or potentially replace certain elements of the ACA. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminates or reduces reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would affect our ability to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 The UK Bribery Act. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering or promising bribes to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. In addition, under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the UK, as we do, may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability is strict, with no element of a corrupt state of mind, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. Furthermore, under the UK Bribery Act there is no exception for facilitation payments.
