ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology products based on our proprietary Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE®) fusion protein immune cell engager technology platform. Our TriKE® platform generates proprietary therapeutics designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient’s own natural killer cells, or NK cells. Once bound to an NK cell, our moieties are designed to enhance the NK cell, and precisely direct it to one or more specifically targeted proteins expressed on a specific type of cancer cell or virus infected cell, resulting in the targeted cell’s death. TriKE®s can be designed to target any number of tumor antigens on hematologic malignancies or solid tumors and do not require patient-specific customization.
 
We are using our TriKE® platform with the intent to bring to market immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, and solid tumors. The platform is scalable, and we are putting processes in place to be able to produce investigational new drug (IND) ready moieties in a timely manner after a specific TriKE® conceptual design. Specific drug candidates can then be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with partnering companies. We believe our TriKE®s may have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used as both monotherapy and in combination with other standard-of-care therapies.
 
We are also using our TriKE® platform to develop therapeutics useful for the treatment of infectious disease such as for the treatment of patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While the use of anti-retroviral drugs has substantially improved the health and increased the longevity of individuals infected with HIV, these drugs are designed to suppress virus replication to help modulate progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to limit further transmission of the virus. Despite the use of anti-retroviral drugs, infected individuals retain reservoirs of latent HIV-infected cells that, upon cessation of anti-retroviral drug therapy, can reactivate and re-establish an active HIV infection. For a curative therapy, destruction of these latent HIV infected cells must take place. The HIV-TriKE® contains the antigen binding fragment (Fab) from a broadly neutralizing antibody targeting the HIV-Env protein or a protein that binds infected CD4+ T cells. The HIV-TriKE® is designed to target HIV while redirecting NK cell killing specifically to actively replicating HIV infected cells. The HIV-TriKE® induced NK cell proliferation and demonstrated the ability in vitro to reactivate and kill HIV-infected T-cells. These findings indicate a potential role for the HIV-TriKE® in the reactivation and elimination of the latently infected HIV reservoir cells by harnessing the NK cell’s ability to mediate the antibody-directed cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Our initial work has been conducted in collaboration with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota under a program led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller, the Deputy Director. Dr. Miller is a recognized key opinion leader in the field of NK cell and IL-15 biology and their therapeutic potential. We have exclusive rights to the TriKE® platform and are generating additional intellectual property for specific moieties.
 
Immuno-Oncology Platform
 
Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKE®s)
 
The generation of chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, expressing T cells from monoclonal antibodies has represented an important step forward in cancer therapy. These therapies involve the genetic engineering of T cells to express either CARs, or T cell receptors, or TCRs, and are designed such that the modified T cells can recognize and destroy cancer cells. While a great deal of interest has recently been placed upon chimeric antigen receptor T, or CAR-T, therapy, it has certain limitations for broad potential applicability because it can require an individual approach that is expensive, time consuming, and may be difficult to apply on a large scale. NK cells represent an important immunotherapeutic target as they are involved in tumor immune-surveillance, can mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), contain pre-made granules with perforin and granzyme B and can quickly secrete inflammatory cytokines, and unlike T cells they do not require antigen priming and can kill cells in the absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation of antigens. Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKE® constructs are composed of a single-chain fusion protein that binds the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potent and lasting cytotoxic killing response, interleukin 15 (IL-15) to promote NK cell activation, persistence and proliferation, and a cancer cell targeting moiety. An additional benefit of TriKE® may have been its attractive biodistribution, as a consequence of their smaller size, which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these advantages, TriKE® is designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties, and can be engineered to target a variety of tumor antigens.
 
We believe there is a continued unmet medical need for targeted immuno-oncology therapies that can have the potential to be dosed in a patient-friendly outpatient setting, can be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy. We believe our TriKE® constructs have this potential and therefore we have generated, and intend to continue to generate, a pipeline of product candidates to be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies.
 
GTB-3550 TriKE® and Phase 1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic Syndrome (AML/MDS) Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 
GTB-3550 is the Company’s first-generation TriKE® product candidate which is a single-chain, tri-specific recombinant fusion protein construct composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15, all connected by small peptide linkers. The GTB-3550 Phase 1 clinical trial for treatment of patients with CD33-expressing, high risk myelodysplastic syndromes and refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia opened for patient enrollment in September 2019 and completed enrollment in September 2021. The clinical trial was conducted at the University of Minnesota’s Masonic Cancer Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota under the direction of Dr. Erica Warlick and Dr. Mark Juckett.
 
Background and Select Non-Clinical Data
 
In conjunction with our research agreement with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, the exploration of targeting NK cells to a variety of tumors initially focused on novel bi-specific killer engagers, or BiKEs, composed of the variable portions of antibodies targeting the CD16 activating receptor on NK cells and CD33 (AML and MDS; see figure below), B7H3 (solid tumors – breast, lung, colon, prostate), Her2 (Breast, Gastric), or CD19/CD22 (B cell lymphomas) on the tumor cells.

Subsequently, a tri-specific (TriKE®) construct that replaced the linker molecule between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv with a modified IL-15 molecule, containing flanking sequences, was generated, and tested. Data indicates that the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 potently induce proliferation of healthy donor NK cells, possibly greater than that induced by exogenous IL-15, which is absent in the BiKE platform. Targeted delivery of the IL-15 through the TriKE® also resulted in specific expansion of the NK cells without inducing T cell expansion on post-transplant patient samples.
 
When compared to the CD16 x CD33 BiKE, the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 TriKE® is also capable of potently restoring killing capacity of post-transplant NK cells against CD33-expressing HL-60 targets and primary AML blasts. These results demonstrated the ability to functionally incorporate an IL-15 cytokine into the BiKE platform and also demonstrated the possibility of targeting a variety of cytokines directly to NK cells while reducing off-target effects and the amount of cytokines needed to obtain biologically relevant function.
 
The figure below is a schematic of a BiKE construct (top) and a TriKE® construct (bottom), which has the modified IL-15 linker between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv components.
 

The CD33 -targeting TriKE® constructs was tested against three separate human tumor cell lines to evaluate specificity: CD33+ HL-60 (promyelocitic leukemia) cells, CD33, Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and CD33- HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma). TriKE®  (GTB-3550) activity was only seen against the CD33+ HL-60 cells containing a Luc reporter to allow for in vivo imaging of the tumors, were used to show in vivo efficacy of BiKE (1633) and TriKE® (GTB-3550) against relevant human tumor targets (HL-60-luc) over an extended period of time. The system consisted of initial conditioning of mice using radiation (250-275 cGy), followed by injection of the tumor cells (I.V. for HL-60-luc, a three-day growth phase, injection of human NK cells, and repeated injection of the drugs of interest, BiKE and TriKE® (three to five times a week). Imaging was carried out at Day 7, 14, and 21, and extended as needed. Subsequent studies were also carried out to evaluate other TriKEs expressing targeting arms against other tumor antigens (B7H3 and HER2 for instance).

The figure below shows the results (tumor burden and mortality) when dosing NK cells alone (top panel), the BiKE version (lacking IL-15) of GTB-3550 (middle panel; called 1633), and the TriKE®, GTB-3550 (bottom panel; then called 161533) in the above human tumor model, HL-60-luc. In the NK-cell-only arm, two out of the five mice were dead by Day 21 with two of the surviving mice having extensive tumor burden as depicted by the colored images. In contrast, all five mice in each of the BiKE and TriKE® arms survived. In addition, the tumor burden in the TriKE®-treated mice was significantly less than in the BiKE-treated mice, demonstrating the improved efficacy from NK cells in the TriKE®-treated mice.
 

Based on these results, and others, the IND for GTB-3550 was filed in June 2017 by the University of Minnesota. The FDA requested that additional preclinical toxicology, additional information and clarifications on manufacturing, and clinical development plans. The requested additional information and clarifications were completed and incorporated into the IND in eCTD format. We filed the IND amendment in June 2018 and announced on November 1, 2018, that the FDA granted approval of the IND and the Company was authorized to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study with GTB-3550 in AML, MDS, and severe mastocytosis. The Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated in September 2019 and closed in September 2021.
 
Targeting Solid Tumors and Other Potentially Attractive Characteristics
 
Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKE® is composed of a single-chain fusion protein that binds the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potentially more potent and lasting response as demonstrated by preclinical studies. An additional benefit due to the smaller size of TriKE® is enhanced biodistribution which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these potential advantages, TriKE® is designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens. We believe these attributes make them an ideal pharmaceutical platform for potentiated NK cell-based immunotherapies and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of CAR-T therapy and other antibody therapies.
 
Examples of our earlier stage solid tumor targeting product candidates are focused on CD33, B7-H3, Her2, CD19, CLEC12A, CD22, and CD133 alone and in combination. We believe these constructs have the potential to target prostate, breast, colon, ovarian, liver, and head and neck cancers. Depending on the availability of drug supply, we hope to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2023.
 
Efficient Advancement of Potential Future Product Candidates – Production and Scale Up
 
We are using our TriKE® platform with the intent to bring to market multiple immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable, and we are currently working with a third-party product manufacturer investigating the optimal GMP production expression system for TriKE® constructs.
 
We believe TriKE®s will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used as both monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care therapies.

Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
 
GTB-3550
 
GTB-3550 was our first TriKE® product candidate. It reflected our first-generation TriKE® platform. It is a single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion protein conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. We studied this anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE® in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. CD33 is primarily a myeloid differentiation antigen with endocytic properties broadly expressed on AML blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells. CD33 or Siglec-3 (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3, SIGLEC3, SIGLEC3, gp67, p67) is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage. It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. The anti-CD33 antibody fragment used for these studies was derived from the M195 humanized anti-CD33 scFV and has been used in multiple human clinical studies. It has been exploited as target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. We believe the recent approval of the antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab validates this targeted approach.
 
GTB-3550 is being replaced by a more potent next-generation camelid nanobody TriKE®, GTB-3650, targeting relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).
 
About High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes is a rare form of bone marrow-related cancer caused by irregular blood cell production within the bone marrow. As a result of this irregular production, MDS patients do not have sufficient normal red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets in circulation. High-risk MDS is associated with poor prognosis, diminished quality of life, and a higher chance of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The goals of therapy are to reduce disease associated symptoms and the risk of disease progression and death, thereby improving both quality and quantity of life. United States incidence of MDS is estimated to be 10,000 cases per year, although the condition is thought to be under diagnosed. The prevalence has been estimated to be from 60,000 to 170,000 in the United States. Approximately 40% of patients with High-Risk MDS transform to AML, another aggressive cancer with poor outcomes.
About Acute Myeloid Leukemia
 
Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 65–69 years. AML is an aggressive disease and is fatal without anti-leukemic treatment. Among patients treated with chemotherapy, 65% to 80% achieve complete remission. Despite a plethora of novel agents that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 2017 for treatment of AML, once complete remission (CR) is achieved, approximately 50% of patients age < 60 years of age and up to 90% of patients ≥ 60 years of age will relapse, despite consolidation strategies. Furthermore, while 10–40% of younger AML patients are primarily refractory to AML induction therapy, the number is considerably higher for patients above 60 years (40–60%). The vast majority of fit AML patients will undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after achieving a CR. However, 40% of these patients relapse after HSCT. Thus, refractory or relapsed (r/r) AML is a very common scenario in AML and despite recent advances and new targeted therapies, the management of AML remains a challenge, particularly in older adults ineligible for intensive therapies. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the five-year survival rate is about 35% in people under 60 years old, and 10% in people over 60 years old. Older people whose health is too poor for intensive chemotherapy have a typical survival of five to ten months. AML accounts for approximately 1.8% of cancer deaths in the United States.

About GTB-3550 TriKE® Clinical Trial
 
We opened our GTB-3550 Phase 1 clinical trial in September 2019 and enrolled our first patient in January 2020. Patients with CD33+ malignancies (primary induction failure or relapsed AML with failure of one reinduction attempt or high-risk MDS progressed on two lines of therapy) age 18 and older were eligible (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03214666). The primary endpoint is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GTB-3550 TriKE®. Correlative objectives include the number, phenotype, activation status and function of NK cells and T cells. From January, 2020 until September, 2021 twelve patients received escalating doses of GTB-3550 in the Phase 1 trial. The results of this trial were presented at several conferences in 2021. To summarize, the therapy was overall well tolerated and safe. There were no serious cases of cytokine release syndrome observed. Four of twelve patients had transient reductions in bone marrow leukemic blast cells. Correlative studies showed activation, proliferation, and persistence of functionally active endogenous NK cells. The results of our first generation GTB-3550 Phase 1 clinical trial support our plans to advance the next generation camelid nanobody into the clinic.
The Next Generation of Camelid Nanobody TriKE®s
 
Our goal is to be a leader in immuno-oncology therapies targeting a broad range of indications including hematological malignancies and solid tumors. A key element of our strategy includes introducing a next-generation camelid nanobody platform. Camelid antibodies (often referred as nanobodies) are smaller than human immunoglobulin and consist of two heavy chains. These nanobodies have the potential to have greater affinity to target antigens, potentially resulting in greater potency. GT Biopharma is utilizing this camelid antibody structure for all its new TriKE® product candidates.
 
Generation of humanized single-domain antibody targeting CD16 for incorporation into the TriKE® platform
 
To develop second generation TriKE®s, we designed a new humanized CD16 engager derived from a single-domain antibody. While scFvs consist of a heavy and a light variable chain joined by a linker, single-domain antibodies consist of a single variable heavy chain capable of engaging without the need of a light chain counterpart (see figure below).
 

These single-domain antibodies are thought to have certain attractive features for antibody engineering, including physical stability, ability to bind deep grooves, and increased production yields, amongst others. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated increased NK cell activation against CD33+ targets including NK cell degranulation (% CD107a+) and IFNg with the single-domain CD16 TriKE® (cam 16-wt15-33; GTB-3650) compared to the original TriKE® (scFv16-m 15-33; GTB-3550) (see figure below). These data were published by Felices M et al (2020) in Cancer Immunol Res.

CD33+ HL60 Targets
 

GTB-3650
 
GTB-3650 is a CD33 targeted TriKE® which targets CD33 on the surface of myeloid leukemias. We are advancing GTB-3650 through preclinical studies and anticipate filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the first half of 2023. We further anticipate starting a study targeting patients with relapsed/refractory AML and high grade MDS by the end of 2023.
 
GTB-5550
 
GTB-5550 is a B7-H3 targeted TriKE® which targets B7-H3 on the surface of advanced solid tumors. We are advancing GTB-5550 through preclinical studies and have initiated a GMP manufacturing campaign in anticipation of filing an IND in the late second half of 2023 and starting a study targeting patients with B7-H3 positive solid tumors in the first half of 2024.
 
Oncology Markets
 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes
 
AML is a heterogeneous hematologic stem cell malignancy in adults with incidence rate of 4.3% per 100,000 populations. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 68 years. AML is an aggressive disease and is fatal without anti-leukemic treatment. AML is the most common form of adult leukemia in the U.S. These patients will require frontline therapy, usually chemotherapy including cytarabine and an anthracycline, a therapy that has not changed in over 40 years. Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by dysplastic features of erythroid/myeloid/megakaryocytic lineages, progressive bone marrow failure, a varying percentage of blast cells, and enhanced risk to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. It is estimated that over 10,000 new cases of MDS are diagnosed each year and there are minimal treatment options; other estimates have put this number higher. In addition, the incidence of MDS is rising for unknown reasons.
B7-H3 Positive Solid Tumors
 
The B7-H3 protein, which functions as a checkpoint inhibitor, has been identified in many of the most common solid tumor cancers, including but not limited to bladder, breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, glioma, kidney, liver, lung, pancreatic, prostate, head and neck cancer, and melanoma. In recent studies, B7-H3 has been identified as a critical promoter of tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer stemness and drug resistance. Because this protein does not seem to be expressed in normal cells, this makes it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.

Manufacturing
 
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. We rely on a third-party contract manufacturing operation to produce and/or test our compounds and expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our potential product candidates as well as for our future commercial needs. We do not have long-term commitments with a third-party product manufacturer. We require in our manufacturing and processing agreements that third-party product manufacturers produce intermediates, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and finished products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain confidentiality agreements with potential and existing manufacturers to protect our proprietary rights related to our drug candidates.
