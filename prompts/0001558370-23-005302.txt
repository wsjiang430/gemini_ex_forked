Item 1. Business.
Overview
Williams Industrial Services Group Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “Williams,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”, unless the context indicates otherwise) was initially formed in 1998 as GEEG Inc., a Delaware corporation, and in 2001 changed its name to “Global Power Equipment Group Inc.,” and, as part of a reorganization, became the successor to GEEG Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company. Effective June 29, 2018, the Company changed its name to Williams Industrial Services Group Inc. to better align its name with the Williams business, and the Company’s stock trades on the NYSE American LLC (the “NYSE American”) under the ticker symbol “WLMS.” Williams has been safely helping plant owners and operators enhance asset value for more than 50 years. It provides a broad range of infrastructure services including construction, maintenance, and support, to customers in energy, power, and industrial end markets. The Company’s mission is to be the preferred provider of construction, maintenance, and specialty services through commitment to superior safety performance, focus on innovation, and dedication to delivering unsurpassed value to its customers.

Our Strategy
Beginning in 2016, we shifted our strategy to become a preferred provider of construction, maintenance, and specialty infrastructure services, to exit all product manufacturing businesses and to use the proceeds from the sales to reduce and restructure our term debt, and during 2018, we completed the restructuring of our Company and began expanding our services. This resulted in us selling our wholly owned subsidiaries, Hetsco Holdings, Inc. and Hetsco, Inc. in January 2017 and our Mechanical Solutions segment and liquidating, in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy process, the entity comprising the Electrical Solutions segment in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Mechanical Solutions and Electrical Solutions segments qualified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This allowed us to review financial information presented on a company-wide basis as a single reporting segment which is comprised of Williams Industrial Services Group, LLC and related subsidiaries (collectively, the “Williams business”). Unless otherwise specified, the financial information and discussion in this Form 10-K are based on our continuing operations (previously referred to as our Services segment); they exclude any results of our discontinued operations. Please refer to “Note 5—Changes in Business” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information.
In 2018, we implemented major cost reduction initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, including restructuring and consolidating our corporate functions, and began working on a comprehensive strategic plan to grow and improve our business, which was finalized in early 2019. Our strategy has been focused on a comprehensive plan to grow and improve our operations, strengthen our core competencies, aggressively manage working capital, and reduce costs in order to improve liquidity and reduce debt. Our common stock now trades on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “WLMS”. 
On December 16, 2020, we entered into new credit facilities which included senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million (collectively, the “Term Loan”), consisting of a $35.0 million closing date term loan facility and up to $15.0 million of borrowing under a delayed draw term loan facility with EICF Agent LLC (“EICF”), an affiliate of Energy Impact Partners, as agent, and CION Investment Corporation as lender and co-lead arranger, and the other lenders party thereto, and a senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC"), which refinanced and replaced our previous credit facilities. The original delayed draw term loan facility expired in June 2022. The Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility mature on December 16, 2025. In connection with the refinancing, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of the prior facilities and all interest in full. For additional information, please refer to “Note 11—Debt” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
During November 2021, we changed our corporate management structure in an effort to reinforce our customer focus and strengthen operations, and, among other changes, added a Chief Operating Officer and a Vice President of Safety. Our Chief Financial Officer was appointed Chief Operating Officer and our Corporate Controller was appointed Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, in 2022, the Company promoted its Senior Vice President of Energy and Industrial to Executive Vice President of Business Development. We are enhancing our management methods to provide additional process capabilities and focus on customer relations and sales.
In early 2022, we lost a major contract with a customer in Canada, and as a result, we exited the Canadian market. This customer contributed 12% of our revenue and approximately 15% of our gross margin in 2021. In addition, in February 2022, we lost a major multi-year contract with a customer within the nuclear decommissioning market contributing to a loss of approximately $374.6 million in backlog for the years 2022 through 2029. We continue to target other growth opportunities within our end markets with greater customer focus and strengthened operational effectiveness. This loss was not a result of performance and does not diminish the Company’s ability to serve its customers. Please refer to Item 1. Business under “Backlog” included in this Form 10-K for additional information.
In the third quarter of 2022, management assessed the Company’s financial condition, resulting in the Company developing a liquidity plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern during 2023. Further, as a result of the Company being unable to comply with its debt covenants and in an effort to address its liquidity constraints, the Company amended its Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility and entered into two unsecured promissory notes (the “Wynnefield Notes”) in favor of Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value, LP and Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value, LP I (collectively, the “Wynnefield Lenders”) during the first quarter of 2023.

In addition, we have engaged an investment banking firm to explore a range of strategic alternatives for the Company to maximize shareholder value, which could include a potential sale. We have not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor made decisions related to further actions or possible strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction, or that any strategic alternative identified, evaluated and consummated will provide the anticipated benefits or otherwise preserve or enhance stockholder value. If the Company’s liquidity improvement plan and the January 9, 2023 and February 24, 2023 amendments to the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility do not have the intended effect of addressing the Company’s liquidity problems through its review of strategic alternatives, including if the Company is unable to obtain future advances under the discretionary delayed draw term loans, the Company will continue to consider all strategic alternatives, including restructuring or refinancing its debt, seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing or delaying the Company’s business activities and strategic initiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures, including obtaining relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully implement its liquidity improvement plan and obtain necessary debt or equity financing to address the Company’s liquidity challenges and continue operations until the Company returns to generating positive cash flow or is otherwise able to execute on a transaction pursuant to its review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. For additional information, please refer to “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Note 2—Liquidity”, “Note 11—Debt” and “Note 18—Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

● | Analog to Digital Conversions. We provide services to convert analog control systems to digital control systems to enhance reliability and accuracy, and increase output of operating plants. Utilities will continue to make significant capital investments in these upgrades throughout the industry. We have extensive experience in performing these upgrades, based on our successful history of completing several projects across our fleet of customers. Moreover, we see substantial opportunity to leverage our experience with performing these projects in the future as the industry continues to invest in these upgrades.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Transmission and Distribution and Substation Construction and Maintenance. We provide quality maintenance and construction services to support the Electric Distribution and Substation Industry by offering a full range of capabilities that provided continuous, cost-effective solutions for overhead and underground distribution lines and substations. Due to our underperformance in the transmission and distribution business in Florida and Connecticut, the Company is no longer pursuing any new projects in these markets. We have exited the Florida transmission and distribution market during the first quarter of 2023 and we are in the process of exiting the Connecticut transmission and distribution market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Decommissioning. We have provided decommissioning services to U.S. nuclear stations that have been retired. Several U.S. nuclear stations have already been shut down, and several more shutdowns are planned. After shutdown, the plants must be decommissioned. This process takes many years. We have worked with owners and prime contractors for decommissioning work and are targeting the decommissioning market as it grows. We are also exploring opportunities related to the decommissioning of fossil power plants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nuclear Power Plant Services and New Nuclear Power Plant Construction. We are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services anywhere in U.S. nuclear power facilities under the rules issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”). Additionally, we are one of only a small number of contractors with a qualified and audited Nuclear Quality Assurance (“NQA-1”) Program, which is required to perform construction of “Safety” related systems in new nuclear power plants. Through our Appendix B Program and other programs, we provide training, certifications, and ongoing safety monitoring to all of our employees working at nuclear sites and have been one of the leading providers of coatings at U.S. nuclear facilities for over 40 years. Under the rules issued by the NRC, owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with NRC regulations on quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. For the majority of our maintenance and project work, we directly hire the labor and provide the management and supervision to perform the work directly for the owner. In some cases, we act as a general contractor and subcontract portions of the work or, alternatively, subcontract our services to full scope engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) firms or general contractor firms. We maintain good relationships with the utilities, the EPC firms, the general contractor firms, and relevant engineering firms. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Biden administration’s key focus is to reduce fossil fuel emissions in the United States power sector and to drive the development of zero-carbon technologies and domestic clean energy supply chains. This led to the establishment of subsidies at the federal level for the nation’s nuclear generating fleet. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act established a $6 billion Nuclear Credit Program, which when fully implemented, will provide credits to subsidize the operation of qualifying units. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law containing nearly $369 billion in climate and clean energy investments and a ten year extension and modification of key tax Credits which includes, among other credits, the Nuclear Power Production Credit which is estimated to be worth approximately $30 billion.
We provide these services throughout the U.S., primarily on a direct hire basis, with experienced craft laborers who are directed and managed by an experienced team of supervisors and project managers across our network. We also act as a general contractor where we manage multiple subcontractors and, in other cases, we are retained as a subcontractor on a project. Our flexible staffing model enables us to meet seasonal and outage demand without being restricted by internal capacity limitations, thereby minimizing our fixed costs.
We bid against other contractors based on customer specifications. Fixed-price contracts present certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Alternatively, because of efficiencies that may be realized during the contract term, fixed-price contracts may offer greater profit potential than cost-plus contracts.
In 2022, 78.5% of our revenue was generated from cost-plus contracts that provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The remaining 21.5% of our revenue was generated from fixed-price contracts.

Safety 
For over 15 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the specialized services we provide. We use the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) to measure safety, which is calculated by multiplying the number of recordable incidents by 200,000 and dividing that number by the total hours worked each year. This metric is also used by others in our industry, which allows for a more objective comparison of our performance. Our TRIR was 0.43 and 0.61 during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to maintain safety measures necessary to preserve the health and wellbeing of our workforce.
Market Overview 
Power Generation Market and the Industrial Services Industry. The U.S. industrial services industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, broadly defined as routine modification, maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants. The industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints, reduce labor costs, increase labor utilization and productivity, and eliminate operational redundancies. 
We expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future:

● | Aging Power Generation Infrastructure Increases Demand for Plant Maintenance and Decommissioning Services. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the U.S. was placed in service before 1990. Coupled with the relatively limited number of large-scale power generation facilities being constructed in the U.S., the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and to take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites result in opportunities for companies providing services to plant operators. Although natural gas prices are expected to remain elevated, driving higher electricity prices, the outlook for natural gas generation is expected to remain steady over the near term, due to continuing constrains on coal-fired power from rapid plant retirements and low inventories, according to Fitch research.

Additionally, at the end of December 2021, the United States had 93 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 55 nuclear power plants in 28 states. The average age of these nuclear reactors is about 40 years old. Although in 2022 there were fewer operating nuclear reactors than in 2012, from 2013 through 2019, annual nuclear generation capacity and electricity generation increased each year (except in 2017) even as the number of operating reactors declined according to the EIA. Power plant uprates—modifications to increase capacity—at nuclear power plants have made it possible for the entire operating nuclear reactor fleet to maintain a relatively consistent total electricity generation capacity. These uprates, combined with high-capacity utilization rates (or capacity factors), have helped nuclear power plants maintain a consistent share of about 20% of total annual U.S. electricity generation since 1990. Some reactors have also increased annual electricity generation by shortening the length of time reactors are offline for refueling. 
While the remainder of the operating plants are planned to operate 60 to 80 years with a stable amount of required generating capacity, utilities plan to invest in maintenance, modification, and upgrades to enable continued operations. Older nuclear reactors require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are subject to a rigorous program of NRC oversight, inspection, preventive and corrective maintenance, equipment replacement and equipment testing. Nuclear power plants are required to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than 24 months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage. While decommissioning work on retired nuclear reactors provides opportunities for growth, the focus is on extending the life of plants through capital improvements.

● | North America Infrastructure Growth. Oil and natural gas production remains at historically high levels, and is expected to continue until 2050, according to the EIA. The United States continues to be an integral part of the global oil and natural gas markets and a significant source of global supply. Increased levels of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid production and accelerated new build and expansion of pipeline and related infrastructure to reduce transportation bottlenecks have combined to supply additional petroleum products to key markets. Infrastructure growth and modifications provide opportunities for us to assist in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.

● | Standby and Distributed Power Generation. Unlike central station generation, standby and distributed power generation equipment can sit on either side of the utility meter and may be owned by a utility, a customer or a third party. Peak energy demand requirements and higher costs, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure limits, are driving investment into this space. The growth in industries with high power demand and sensitivity to power supply instability, such as datacenters, medical centers, universities and remotely located industrial loads, are straining the traditional power infrastructure. The electric power needs for these markets have historically been served by small-scale utility-owned diesel or gas engine generators strategically located to support distributed system operations. The power supply is trending toward larger (greater than 1,000 kilowatts) diesel engine generator systems and expanding into alternative energy assets.

● | Water and Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure Maintenance and Capital Improvements Demand. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we decided to exit our Florida water business. This was largely based on a $6 million write-down in revenue on our two largest water projects in Florida. The Company is no longer pursuing water projects. These two projects are scheduled to be completed in the second and fourth quarter of 2023, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers, Marketing and Seasonality 
Our customers include major private and government-owned utilities throughout the U.S., as well as leaders in the U.S. pulp and paper and industrial sectors. We market our services using dedicated sales and marketing personnel as well as our experienced on-site operations personnel. We use our safety and service track record with long-term renewable contracts to expand our services and supplement existing contracts with small- to medium-sized capital projects. Our sales initiatives directly seek to apply operational strengths to specific facilities within our targeted industries and customers throughout the U.S. We are impacted by seasonality, resulting in fluctuations in revenue and gross profit during our fiscal year. Generally, this is driven by our customers’ schedule of planned outages which are typically scheduled for every other year.
We depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any of those customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. For a listing of our major customers, please refer to “Note 16—Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
In early 2022, we lost a major contract with a customer in Canada, and as a result, we exited the Canadian market. This customer contributed 12% of our revenue and approximately 15% of our gross margin in 2021. In addition, the Company lost a multi-year contract within the nuclear decommissioning market in February 2022 that contributed to a loss of approximately $374.6 million of backlog for the years 2022 through 2029. This contract did not represent a material amount of gross profit. Please refer to Item 1. Business under “Backlog” in this Form 10-K for additional information. 
Materials and Suppliers
The markets for most of the materials we use are served by a large number of suppliers, and we believe that we can obtain required materials from more than one supplier. Although we are not dependent on any single supplier, vendor or subcontractor, our ability to obtain necessary supplies to complete our projects is contingent on our ability to successfully implement our liquidity plan. For additional information, please refer to “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Note 2—Liquidity” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Competition
Our competitors vary depending on geography and the scope of services to be rendered. Several national service providers, which are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do, will often compete for larger maintenance and capital project opportunities that become available. These service providers include, among others, Allied Power, BHI Energy and Day & Zimmermann. Additionally, smaller contractors that operate on a regional basis often compete for smaller opportunities associated with open shop labor sources. We compete based on reputation, safety, price, service, quality, and our breadth of service capabilities. We believe our strong reputation, longevity in the industry, project management capabilities, including service diversity, long-term customer relationships, safety record and performance, and our success at identifying and retaining qualified personnel differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe that the fact that we maintain a presence at several of our customers’ sites is a competitive advantage because it provides us with an intimate understanding of these facilities, which allows us to better identify our customers’ service needs. Specific to our customers that operate nuclear power plants, barriers to entry include the requirement to hold and maintain the rigorous NRC qualifications and safety standards.

Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations; however, we remain exposed to potential losses because we are subject to deductibles, coverage limits and retention requirements.
Typically, our contracts require us to indemnify our customers for third party injury, damage or loss arising from the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the customer as an additional insured up to the limits of insurance available, or we may be required to purchase special insurance policies for specific customers. We maintain performance and payment bonding lines to support our business. In rare cases we may provide a letter of credit in lieu of a bond to satisfy performance and financial guarantees on a project.
We generally require all subcontractors working with us at a customer’s location to indemnify us and our customers and name us as an additional insured for activities arising out of such subcontractors’ work. We also require certain subcontractors to provide additional insurance policies, including surety bonds in favor of us, to secure such subcontractors’ work or as required by contract. It is possible that our insurance and the additional insurance coverage provided by our subcontractors will not fully protect us against a valid claim or loss under the contracts with our customers. 
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2022, we used the Williams trade name and its logo. We have registered federal trademarks related to certain Company logos as well as registered trademarks related to certain Company logos in Canada. We presently have no U.S. patents in force. We rely on trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. This Form 10-K may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and those brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. 
Compliance with Government Regulations
We are subject to certain federal, state, and local environmental, occupational health and nuclear regulatory laws applicable in the U.S. We also purchase materials and equipment from third parties and engage subcontractors who are also subject to these laws and regulations. Below is a summary of certain laws and regulations applicable to our business.

● | Environmental. We are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. These laws and regulations relate primarily to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous materials. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure, or other accident involving such pollutants, substances, or hazardous materials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Health and Safety Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state and international laws. Regulations promulgated by these agencies require employers and independent contractors who perform construction services, including electrical and repair and maintenance, to implement work practices, medical surveillance systems and personnel protection programs to protect employees from workplace hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. In recognition of the potential for accidents within various scopes of work, these agencies have enacted very strict and comprehensive safety regulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NRC. Owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are licensed to build, operate, and maintain those plants by the NRC. Their license requires that they qualify their suppliers and contractors to ensure that the suppliers and contractors comply with NRC regulations. We must demonstrate to our customers that we comply with NRC regulations related to quality assurance, reporting of safety issues, security and control of personnel access and conduct. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Department of the Treasury. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we believe that we operate safely and prudently and in material compliance with all environmental, occupational health, nuclear regulatory and other applicable laws, there can be no assurance that accidents will not occur or that we will not incur substantial liability in connection with the operation of our business. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures or material adverse effect on earnings or cash flows as a result of complying with these laws.
Backlog 
The services we provide are typically carried out under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. Total backlog represents the dollar amount of revenue expected to be recorded in the future for work performed under awarded contracts. 
Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, the customer’s budgetary constraints and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be recognized in different periods and at levels other than those originally projected. Additional work that is not identified under the original contract is added to our estimated backlog when we reach an agreement with the customer as to the scope and pricing of that additional work. Backlog is reduced as work is performed and revenue is recognized, or upon cancellation.
Backlog is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled, modified, or otherwise altered by our customers. We utilize our calculation of backlog to assist in measuring aggregate awards under existing contractual relationships with our customers. We believe our backlog disclosures will assist investors in better understanding this estimate of the services to be performed pursuant to awards by our customers under existing contractual relationships.

Employees 
We believe our employees are our greatest asset. Our business success is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain high performing talent by providing a culture that is built on our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, and results.
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires a commitment from employees, officers and directors at the Company and its subsidiaries to conduct business honestly and ethically. Among other things, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics encourages employees to talk to supervisors, managers, or other appropriate personnel, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, or the General Counsel, about observed illegal or unethical behavior and the best course of action in a particular situation. The Company has a confidential hotline administered by an outside firm that an employee can call or visit on the internet to anonymously submit a report in the event he or she has ethical concerns or suspects instances of misconduct. 
For over 15 years, we have maintained a safety record in the top quartile of the industry, benefiting both us and our customers. We also maintain a broad range of professional certifications and memberships in national organizations relevant to the performance of many of the services we provide.
We have implemented a robust human performance strategy that focuses on organizational factors, job-site conditions, individual behavior, and results. This strategy has contributed to a highly reliable organizational culture that has produced and consistently sustained positive results.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 506 full-time employees (excluding temporary staff and craft labor), and we did not have any part-time employees. The number of our employees, including temporary staff and craft labor, fluctuates greatly, depending on the timing and requirements for craft labor. Many of the craft labor employees are employed through various union agreements. As of December 31, 2022, there were 758 craft labor employees, of which 644 were under collective-bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees, both full-time and temporary, are satisfactory.
