Item 1.  Business

Methode Electronics, Inc. was incorporated in 1946 as an Illinois corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966.  As used herein, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Methode” means Methode Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

We are a global manufacturer of component and subsystem devices with manufacturing, design and testing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Lebanon, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our primary manufacturing facilities are located in Dongguan and Shanghai, China; Cairo, Egypt; Mriehel, Malta; and Fresnillo and Monterrey, Mexico. Our corporate headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois. We design, manufacture and market devices employing electrical, radio remote control, electronic, light-emitting diode ("LED") based lighting, wireless and sensing technologies.  Our components are found in the primary end-markets of the aerospace, appliance, automotive, commercial vehicles, communications (including information processing and storage, networking equipment and wireless and terrestrial voice/data systems), construction, consumer and industrial equipment, medical, rail and other transportation industries.

We maintain our financial records on the basis of a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30. Fiscal 2019 ended on April 27, 2019, fiscal 2018 ended on April 28, 2018 and fiscal 2017 ended on April 29, 2017, and all represented 52 weeks of results.

Segments.  Effective October 27, 2018, we reorganized our reportable segments resulting from the acquisition of Grakon Parent, Inc. ("Grakon"). Prior to the acquisition of Grakon, our reportable segments were Automotive, Power, Interface and Other. As a result of this change, our reportable segments are now Automotive, Industrial, Interface and Medical. Historical information has been revised to reflect the new reportable segments. Refer to Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Area Information," in our consolidated financial statements for further information.

The Automotive segment supplies electronic and electro-mechanical devices and related products to automobile original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), either directly or through their tiered suppliers. Our products include integrated center consoles, hidden switches, ergonomic switches, transmission lead-frames, LED based lighting and sensors, which incorporate magneto-elastic sensing and other technologies that monitor the operation or status of a component or system.

The Industrial segment manufactures external lighting solutions, industrial safety radio remote controls, braided flexible cables, current-carrying laminated busbars and devices, custom power-product assemblies, such as our PowerRail® solution, high-current low-voltage flexible power cabling systems and powder-coated busbars that are used in various markets and applications, including aerospace, commercial vehicles, computers, industrial, power conversion, military, telecommunications and transportation.

The Interface segment provides a variety of copper and fiber-optic interface and interface solutions for the appliance, commercial food service, construction, consumer, material handling, point-of-sale and telecommunications markets.  Solutions include copper transceivers and solid-state field-effect consumer touch panels.
The Medical segment is made up of our medical device business, Dabir Surfaces, Inc., our surface support technology aimed at pressure injury prevention. Dabir has developed the technology for use by patients who are immobilized or otherwise at risk for pressure injuries, including patients undergoing long-duration surgical procedures.
Sales.  The following table reflects the percentage of net sales by segment for the last three fiscal years.

 | Fiscal Year Ended
 | April 27, 2019 | | April 28, 2018 | | April 29, 2017
Automotive | 73.4 | % | | 80.3 | % | 77.5 | %
Industrial | 20.7 | % | | 11.6 | % | 11.3 | %
Interface | 5.8 | % | | 8.1 | % | 11.2 | %
Medical | 0.1 | % | | — | % | — | %


The majority of our sales activities are directed by sales managers who are supported by field application engineers and other technical personnel who work with customers to design our products into their systems.  Our field application

engineers also help us identify emerging markets and new products.  Our products are primarily sold through our in-house sales staff. We also utilize independent manufacturers’ representatives with offices throughout the world.  Information about our sales and operations in different geographic regions is summarized in Note 11, "Segment Information and Geographic Area Information," in our consolidated financial statements.  Sales are made primarily to OEMs, either directly or through their tiered suppliers, as well as to selling partners and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Materials.  The principal materials that we purchase include application-specific integrated circuits, coil and bar stock, ferrous and copper alloy sheets, glass, LED displays, plastic molding resins, precious metals, and silicon die castings.  All of these items are available from several suppliers and we generally rely on more than one supplier for each item.

Patents.  We have been granted a number of patents in the U.S., Europe and Asia and have additional domestic and international patent applications pending related to our products and manufacturing processes. Our existing patents expire on various dates from 2019 to 2036. We seek patents in order to protect our interest in certain products and technologies, including our TouchSensor field-effect touch technology, magneto-elastic torque sensing, medical devices and high-power distribution products. We do not believe any single patent is material to our business, nor would the expiration or invalidity of any patent have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.

Seasonality.  A significant portion of our business is dependent upon automotive and commercial vehicle sales and the production schedules of our customers.  The automotive and commercial vehicle markets are cyclical and depend on general economic conditions, interest rates, fuel prices and consumer spending patterns. 

Material Customers.  During fiscal 2019, shipments to General Motors Corporation (“GM”) and Ford Motor Company (“Ford”), or their tiered suppliers, represented 35.5% and 11.6%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.  In general, these sales were for component parts used in particular vehicle models of the OEMs. Typically, our GM and Ford supply arrangements for each component part include a blanket purchase order and production releases. In general, a blanket purchase order is issued for each GM or Ford part as identified by the customer part number. Each such GM or Ford blanket purchase order accounted for less than 10.0% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales. Each blanket purchase order includes standard terms and conditions, including price. In certain circumstances, we supply GM or Ford the requirements for a particular customer vehicle model for the life of the model, which can vary from three to seven years. Both GM and Ford order parts using production releases approved under the relevant blanket purchase order. The production releases are submitted by the various GM or Ford plants and include information regarding part quantities and delivery specifications.
Backlog. Our backlog of orders was approximately $275.1 million at April 27, 2019, and $249.2 million at April 28, 2018.  We expect that most of the backlog at April 27, 2019 will be shipped within fiscal 2020.

Competitive Conditions.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments.  We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas; many of these competitors have greater resources and sales.  Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products.

Research and Development.  We maintain a research and development program involving a number of professional employees who devote a majority of their time to the enhancement of existing products and to the development of new products and processes.  Research and development costs primarily relate to product engineering and design and development expenses and are classified as a component of costs of products sold on our consolidated statements of income. Expenditures for such activities amounted to $41.2 million for fiscal 2019, $37.9 million for fiscal 2018 and $27.8 million for fiscal 2017.

Environmental Matters.  Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.  Currently, we do not have any material environmental-related lawsuits or material administrative proceedings pending against us.  Further information as to environmental matters affecting us is presented in Note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies," in our consolidated financial statements.

Employees.  At April 27, 2019 and April 28, 2018, we had 6,187 and 5,056 employees, respectively.  We also, from time to time, employ part-time employees and hire independent contractors.  Our employees from our Malta and Mexico facilities, which account for approximately 54% of our total number of employees, are represented by collective bargaining agreements.  We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our employee relations are good.
