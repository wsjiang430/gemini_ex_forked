ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Business Overview 
 We are a global pharmaceutical company, committed to helping patients around the world to access affordable medicines and benefit from innovations to improve their health. Our mission is to be a global leader in generics, specialty medicines and biopharmaceuticals, improving the lives of patients. 
 We operate worldwide, with headquarters in Israel and a significant presence in the United States, Europe and many other markets around the world. Our key strengths include our world-leading generic medicines expertise and portfolio, focused specialty medicines portfolio and global infrastructure and scale. 
 Teva was incorporated in Israel on February 13, 1944 and is the successor to a number of Israeli corporations, the oldest of which was established in 1901. 
 Our Business Segments 
 We operate our business through three segments: North America, Europe and International Markets. Each business segment manages our entire product portfolio in its region, including generics, specialty and over-the-counter (OTC) products. This structure enables strong alignment and integration between operations, commercial regions, R&D and our global marketing and portfolio function, optimizing our product lifecycle across therapeutic areas. 
 In addition to these three segments, we have other activities, primarily the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to third parties and certain contract manufacturing services.

 In December 2017, we announced a comprehensive restructuring plan intended to significantly reduce our cost base, unify and simplify our organization and improve business performance, profitability, cash flow generation and productivity. This plan is intended to reduce our total cost base by $3 billion by the end of 2019. 
 For information regarding our major customers, see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 For information regarding certain business transactions completed during 2018, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsTransactions. 
 Below is an overview of our three business segments. 
 North America 
 Our North America segment includes the United States and Canada. 
 We are the leading generic drug company in the United States. We market over 500 generic prescription and OTC products in more than 2,000 dosage strengths and packaging sizes, including oral solid dosage forms, injectable products, inhaled products, liquids, ointments and creams. Most of our generic sales in the United States are made to retail drug chains, mail order distributors and wholesalers. 
 Our wholesale and retail selling efforts are supported by participation in key pharmaceutical conferences as well as focused advertising in professional journals and on leading pharmacy websites. We continue to strengthen consumer awareness of the benefits of generic medicines through partnerships and digital marketing programs. 
 During 2018, our generics business in the United States continued to be negatively impacted by certain developments, including: (i) pricing pressure as a result of customer consolidation into larger buying groups capable of extracting greater price reductions, (ii) an accelerated FDA approval process for generic versions of off-patent medicines, resulting in increased competition for these products, and (iii) delays in the launch of some of our new generic products. We have also experienced supply discontinuities due to regulatory actions and approval delays, which also had an impact on our ability to timely meet demand in certain instances. 
 Our specialty portfolio in North America has an established presence in central nervous system (CNS) medicines with our leading product COPAXONE®, which is among the leading products for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) in North America. In addition, we continue to strengthen our specialty portfolio with the recent launch of AJOVY® for the treatment of migraine and the continued growth of our neurodegenerative and movement disorder treatment medicine AUSTEDO®. We are committed to maintaining a leading presence in the respiratory market by delivering a range of medicines for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We also maintain a meaningful presence in oncology medicines. 
 Anda, our distribution business in the United States, distributes generic, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from various third party manufacturers to independent retail pharmacies, pharmacy retail chains, hospitals and physician offices in the United States. Anda is able to compete in the secondary distribution market by maintaining high inventory levels for a broad offering of products, competitive pricing and offering next day delivery throughout the United States. 
 Europe 
 Our Europe segment includes the European Union and certain other European countries. 
 We are the leading generic pharmaceutical company in Europe. We are among the top three companies in more than 20 markets across Europe. No single market in Europe represents more than 25% of our total 
 
3 


  European generic revenues, and therefore we are not dependent on any single market that could be affected by pricing reforms or changes in public policy. In Europe, we also out-license certain generic pharmaceutical products to third parties. 
 Despite their diversity and highly fragmented nature, the European markets share many characteristics that allow us to leverage our pan-European presence and broad portfolio. Global customers are crucial partners in our generic business and are expanding across Europe, although customer consolidation is lower than in the United States. We are one of a few generic pharmaceutical companies with a pan-European footprint. Most competitors focus on a select few markets or business lines. 
 Our OTC portfolio in Europe includes global brands such as SUDOCREM® as well as local and regional brands like FLUX® in the Nordic countries. 
 Our specialty portfolio in Europe focuses on three main areas: CNS and pain, respiratory and oncology. Our leading product is COPAXONE, which is among the leading products for the treatment of MS in the European Union. 
 International Markets 
 Our International Markets segment includes all countries in which we operate other than those in our North America and Europe segments. These markets comprise more than 35 countries, covering a substantial portion of the global pharmaceutical market. 
 Our key international markets are Japan, Russia and Israel. In Japan, we operate our business through a business venture with Takeda Pharmaceutical Companies Limited (Takeda), in which we own a 51% stake and Takeda owns the remaining 49%. The countries in our International Markets segment range from highly regulated, pure generic markets, such as Israel, to hybrid markets, such as Japan, to branded generics oriented markets, such as Russia and certain Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Latin American and Asia Pacific markets. 
 Each markets strategy is built upon differentiation and filling the unmet needs of that market. Our integrated sales force enables us to extract synergies across our branded generic, OTC and specialty medicines product offerings and across various channels (e.g., retail, institutional). 
 Our specialty portfolio in International Markets focuses on three main areas: CNS and pain, respiratory and oncology. 
 Our Product Portfolio and Business Offering 
 Our product and service portfolio includes generic medicines, specialty medicines, OTC products, a distribution business, API and contract manufacturing. Each region manages the entire range of products and services offered in its region and our global marketing and portfolio function optimizes our pipeline and product lifecycle across therapeutic areas. In most markets in which we operate, we use an integrated and comprehensive marketing model, offering a portfolio of generic, specialty and OTC products. 
Generic Medicines 
 Generic medicines are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of originator medicines and are typically more affordable in comparison to the originators products. Generics are required to meet similar governmental requirements as their brand-name equivalents, such as those relating to manufacturing processes and health authorities inspections, and must receive regulatory approval prior to their sale in any given country. Generic medicines may be manufactured and marketed if relevant patents on their brand-name equivalents (and any additional government-mandated market exclusivity periods) have expired or have been challenged or otherwise circumvented. 
 
4 


 We develop, manufacture and sell generic medicines in a variety of dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, injectables, inhalants, liquids, ointments and creams. We offer a broad range of basic chemical entities, as well as specialized product families, such as sterile products, hormones, high-potency drugs and cytotoxic substances, in both parenteral and solid dosage forms. 
 Our generic business has a wide-reaching commercial presence. We are the market leader in the United States and have a top three leadership position in over 30 countries, including some of our key European markets. We have a robust product portfolio, comprehensive R&D capabilities and product pipeline and a global operational network, which enables us to execute key generic launches to further expand our product pipeline and diversify our revenue stream. We use these capabilities to mitigate price erosion in our generics business. 
 When considering whether to develop a generic medicine, we take into account a number of factors, including our overall strategy, regional and local patient and customer needs, R&D and manufacturing capabilities, regulatory considerations, commercial factors and the intellectual property landscape. We will challenge patents when appropriate if we believe they are either invalid or would not be infringed by our generic version. We may seek alliances to acquire rights to products we do not have in our portfolio, to share development costs or litigation risks, or to resolve patent and regulatory barriers to entry. 
 As part of our comprehensive restructuring plan, we have substantially optimized our generics portfolio globally, particularly in the United States, through product discontinuation and price adjustments, with a focus on increasing profitability. This will enable us to accelerate the restructuring and optimization of our manufacturing and supply network, including the closure or divestment of a significant number of manufacturing plants in the United States, Europe and International Markets. 
 In markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel, generic medicines may be substituted by the pharmacist for their brand name equivalent or prescribed by International Nonproprietary Name (INN). In these so-called pure generic markets, physicians and patients have little control over the choice of generic manufacturer, and consequently generic medicines are not actively marketed or promoted to physicians or consumers. Instead, the relationship between the manufacturer and pharmacy chains and distributors, health funds and other health insurers is critical. Many of these markets have automatic substitution models when generics are available as alternatives to brands. In Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, certain Asia Pacific, Latin American and European countries, generic medicines are generally sold under brand names alongside the originator brand. These markets are referred to as branded generic markets and are generally out of pocket markets in which consumers can pay for a particular branded generic medicine (as opposed to government or privately funded medical health insurance), often at the recommendation of their physician. Branded generic products are actively promoted and a sales force is necessary to create and maintain brand awareness. Other markets, such as Germany, Japan, France, Italy and Spain, are hybrid markets with elements of both approaches. 
 Our position in the generics market is supported by our global R&D function, as well as our API R&D and manufacturing activities, which provide significant vertical integration for our products. 
 For information about our product launches and pipeline of generic medicines in North America and Europe, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment InformationNorth America Segment and Item 7Managements Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment InformationEurope Segment. 
 Specialty Medicines 
 Our specialty medicines business, which is focused on delivering innovative solutions to patients and providers via medicines, devices and services in key regions and markets around the world, includes our core therapeutic areas of CNS (with a strong emphasis on MS, neurodegenerative disorders, movement disorders and 
 
5 


  pain care including migraine) and respiratory medicines (with a focus on asthma and COPD). We also have specialty products in oncology and selected other areas. 
 We deploy medical and sales and marketing professionals within each therapeutic area who seek to address the needs of patients and healthcare professionals. We tailor our patient support, payer relations and medical affairs activities to the distinct characteristics of each therapeutic area and medicine. 
 The U.S. market is the most significant market in our specialty business. In Europe and International Markets, we leverage existing synergies between our specialty business and our generics and OTC businesses. Our specialty presence in International Markets is mainly built on our CNS franchise, with gradual development in other therapeutic areas closely related to our branded generics portfolios in those countries. 
 We have built specialized Patient Support Programs to help patients adhere to their treatments, improve patient outcomes and, in certain markets, to ensure timely delivery of medicines and assist in securing reimbursement. These programs reflect the importance we place on supporting patients and ensuring better medical outcomes for them. As part of our restructuring plan, we outsourced certain of these services to external vendors. Patient Support Programs are currently operated in many countries around the world in multiple therapeutic areas. We believe that it is important to provide a range of services and solutions tailored to meet the needs of patients according to their specific condition and local market requirements. We believe this capability provides an important competitive advantage in the specialty medicines market. 
 Below is a description of our key products: 
 CNS and Pain 
 Our CNS and pain portfolio includes COPAXONE for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, AJOVY for the treatment of migraine (launched in the United States in September 2018) and AUSTEDO for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington disease (launched in the United States in 2017). 
 COPAXONE 
 

 | COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate injection) is one of the leading MS therapies in the United States (according to IQVIA data as of January 4, 2019). COPAXONE is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS (RMS), including the reduction of the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), including in patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | COPAXONE is believed to have a unique mechanism of action that works with the immune system, unlike many therapies that are believed to rely on general immune suppression or cell sequestration to exert their effect. COPAXONE provides a proven mix of efficacy, safety and tolerability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The FDA approved generic versions of COPAXONE 40 mg/mL in October 2017 and February 2018 and a second generic version of COPAXONE 20 mg/mL in October 2017 in the United States. Hybrid versions of COPAXONE 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL were also approved in the European Union.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | On October 12, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) handed down its ruling in the consolidated appeal of decisions from the U.S. District Court and Patent Trial and Appeal Board, relating to patents covering COPAXONE 40 mg/ml. The CAFC found all claims at issue to be invalid, and we are currently evaluating our options for further appeals. COPAXONE 40 mg/mL is protected by one European patent expiring in 2030. This patent is being challenged in Italy and Norway and has been opposed at the European Patent Office. The U.K. High Court found this patent invalid and our application for permission to appeal this decision was rejected.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The market for MS treatments continues to develop, particularly with the recent approvals of generic versions of COPAXONE discussed above, as well as additional generic versions expected to be
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 


 
approved in the future. Oral treatments for MS, such as Tecfidera®, Gilenya® and Aubagio®, continue to present significant and increasing competition. COPAXONE also continues to face competition from existing injectable products, as well as from monoclonal antibodies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AJOVY (anti CGRP) 
 

 | AJOVY is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). On September 14, 2018, the FDA approved AJOVY (fremanezumab-vfrm) injection for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. We launched the product in the United States immediately upon approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In February 2019, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended granting a Marketing Authorization Application for AJOVY in the European Union in a centralized process. We expect regulatory action in the first half of 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | On May 12, 2017, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka) providing Otsuka with an exclusive license to conduct phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for AJOVY in Japan and, once approved, to commercialize the product in Japan.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AJOVY is also in clinical development to evaluate safety and efficacy in the treatment of episodic cluster headache as well as post traumatic headache.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AJOVY is protected by patents expiring in 2026 in Europe and in 2027 in the United States, with possibility for extension in various markets. An additional patent relating to the use of AJOVY in the treatment of migraine is issued in the United States and will expire in 2035. This patent is also pending in other countries. AJOVY will also be protected by regulatory exclusivity of 12 years from marketing approval in the United States and 10 years from marketing approval in Europe.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Eli Lilly & Co.s (Lilly) marketing and sale of its galcanezumab product for the treatment of migraine infringes nine Teva patents. Lilly has also submitted IPR (inter partes review) petitions to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, challenging the validity of the nine patents asserted against them in the litigation. In addition, we have entered into separate agreements with Alder Biopharmaceuticals and Lilly, resolving the European Patent Office oppositions they have filed against our AJOVY patents. The settlement agreement with Lilly also resolved Lillys action to revoke the patent protecting AJOVY in the U.K.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUSTEDO 
 

 | AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine) is a deuterated form of a small molecule inhibitor of vesicular monoamine 2 transporter, or VMAT2, that is designed to regulate the levels of a specific neurotransmitter, dopamine, in the brain. The FDA granted Deutetrabenazine New Chemical Entity Exclusivity until April 2022 and Orphan Drug exclusivity for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease until April 2024.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AUSTEDO was approved by the FDA and launched in April 2017 in the United States for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. In August 2017, the FDA approved AUSTEDO for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in adults in the United States and we launched AUSTEDO for the treatment of TD in September 2017. TD is a debilitating, often irreversible movement disorder caused by certain medications used to treat mental health or gastrointestinal conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In September 2017, we entered into a partnership agreement with Nuvelution Pharma, Inc (Nuvelution) for the development of AUSTEDO for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in pediatric patients in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 


 
 | AUSTEDO is protected in the United States by five Orange Book patents expiring between 2031 and 2033 and in Europe by two patents expiring in 2029.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oncology 
 Our oncology portfolio includes BENDEKA® / TREANDA®, GRANIX® and TRISENOX®in the United States and LONQUEX®, TEVAGRASTIM®/RATIOGRASTIM® and TRISENOX® outside the United States. 
 BENDEKA and TREANDA 
 

 | BENDEKA (bendamustine hydrochloride) injection and TREANDA (bendamustine hydrochloride) for injection are approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. BENDEKA, which was launched in the United States in January 2016, is a liquid, low-volume (50 mL) and short-time 10-minute infusion formulation of bendamustine hydrochloride that we licensed from Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eagle) to complement our bendamustine franchise, which also includes TREANDA. BENDEKA is now the most-used bendamustine product in the United States. The lyophilized formulation of TREANDA continues to be available, but its use has substantially declined in favor of BENDEKA. In December 2018, TREANDA was approved in China.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Eagle launched a ready-to-dilute bendamustine hydrochloride in June 2018, which competes directly with Bendeka. Other competitors to BENDEKA include combination therapies such as R-CHOP (a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone in combination with rituximab) and CVP-R (a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone in combination with rituximab) for the treatment of NHL, as well as a combination of fludarabine, doxorubicin and rituximab for the treatment of CLL and newer targeted oral therapies, ibrutinib and idelilisib.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | There are 15 patents listed in the U.S. Orange Book for BENDEKA with expiry dates between 2026 and 2033. Teva and Eagle received notices of Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filings by Slayback Pharmaceuticals, Fresenius Kabi, Apotex and Mylan for generic versions of BENDEKA, which all contained Paragraph IV challenges against one or more of the patents listed in the U.S. Orange Book for BENDEKA. In response, Teva and Eagle filed patent infringement lawsuits against Slayback, Fresenius and Apotex in August 2017 and against Mylan in December 2017. All lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The respective 30 month stays expire starting in January 2020. Additionally, in June 2018, Teva and Eagle received a notification from Hospira that it filed a 505(b)(2) new drug application (NDA) referencing BENDEKA. In response, Teva and Eagle filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Hospiras 30 month stay expires in December 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have U.S. Orange Book patents for TREANDA expiring between 2026 and 2031. To date, one company has filed an NDA for a liquid version of bendamustine and 21 others have filed ANDAs for a generic version of the lyophilized form of TREANDA. Trial against five of the 21 ANDA filers began in December 2015. In June 2017, the court issued a final judgement affirming the validity of certain claims of the patents. We have reached final settlements with 19 of the 21 ANDA filers, which provide for the launch of generic versions prior to patent expiration. The two ANDA filers with whom we have not reached final settlements filed an appeal of the final judgment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In July 2018, Eagle prevailed in its suit in the U.S. district court against the FDA to obtain seven years of orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for BENDEKA. The FDA has appealed the district courts decision, but barring a reversal by the appellate court, drug applications referencing BENDEKA will not be approved by the FDA until the orphan drug exclusivity expires in December 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Truxima®


 | Truxima (rituximab-abbs) is a monoclonal antibody biosimilar to Rituxan® (rituximab). It was approved by the FDA in November 2018 for the treatment of adult patients in three indications: (i) relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell nonHodgkins lymphoma (NHL) as a single agent, (ii) previously untreated follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL in combination with first line chemotherapy and, in patients achieving a complete or partial response to a rituximab product in combination with chemotherapy, as single-agent maintenance therapy, and (iii) non-progressing (including stable disease), low-grade, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL as a single agent after first-line cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Truxima is the first rituximab biosimilar to be approved in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We entered into an exclusive partnership with Celltrion, Inc. (Celltrion) in October 2016 to commercialize Truxima in the United States and Canada.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have reached an agreement with Genentech, Inc. (Genentech) to settle the U.S. patent litigation regarding Truxima, including entry terms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Herzuma®


 | Herzuma (trastuzumab-pkrb) is a HER2/neu receptor antagonist biosimilar to Herceptin®1 (trastuzumab). Herzuma was approved by the FDA in December 2018 for the following indications: (i) adjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressing node positive or node negative (ER/PR negative or with one high risk feature) breast cancer, as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel or as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin, and (ii) in combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, or as a single agent for treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We entered into an exclusive partnership with Celltrion in October 2016 to commercialize Herzuma in the United States and Canada.

 ProAir 
 

 | The ProAir line of products includes ProAir hydrofluoroalkane (HFA), ProAir RespiClick® and ProAir Digihaler, which are sold only in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ProAir HFA (albuterol sulfate) is an inhalation aerosol with dose counter and is indicated for patients four years of age and older for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm with reversible obstructive airway disease and for the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. ProAir HFA is the leading quick relief inhaler in the United States. It is protected by various patents expiring through 2031. In June 2014, we settled a patent challenge to ProAir HFA with Perrigo Pharmaceuticals (Perrigo) permitting Perrigo to launch its generic product in limited quantities once it receives FDA approval and without quantity limitations after June 2018. In November 2017, we settled another patent challenge to ProAir HFA with Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et al. (Lupin) permitting Lupin to launch its generic product as of September 23, 2019, or earlier under certain circumstances. To date, no generic competition has been launched. In January 2019, we launched our own ProAir authorized generic.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ProAir Digihaler (albuterol sulfate 117 mcg) inhalation powder is the first and only digital inhaler with built-in sensors which connects to a companion mobile application and provides inhaler use information to people with asthma and COPD. ProAir Digihaler was approved by the FDA on December 21, 2018 for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients aged four years and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) in patients aged four years and older. ProAir Digihaler contains built-in sensors that detect when the inhaler is used and measure inspiratory flow. This inhaler-use data is then sent to the companion mobile app using Bluetooth® Wireless Technology so patients can review their data over time and, if desired, share it with their healthcare professionals. ProAir Digihaler will be available in the United States in 2019 through a small number of early experience programs, which will be conducted in partnership with healthcare systems and in limited geographies, in order to gather real-world experience. A national launch is planned for 2020.

Other Activities 
 We have other sources of revenues, primarily the sale of APIs to third parties, certain contract manufacturing services and an out-licensing platform offering a portfolio of products to other pharmaceutical companies through our affiliate Medis. 
 We produce approximately 300 APIs for our own use and for sale to third parties in many therapeutic areas. APIs used in pharmaceutical products are subject to regulatory oversight by national health authorities. We utilize a variety of production technologies, including chemical synthesis, semi-synthetic fermentation, enzymatic synthesis, high potency manufacturing, plant extract technology and peptide synthesis. Our advanced technology and expertise in the field of solid state particle technology enable us to meet specifications for particle size distribution, bulk density, specific surface area and polymorphism, as well as other characteristics. 
 We sell medical devices and provide contract manufacturing services related to products divested in connection with the sale of certain business lines in the past, as well as other miscellaneous items. Our other activities are not included in our North America, Europe and International Markets segments described above. 
 Research and Development 
 Our R&D activities span the breadth of our business, including generic medicines (finished goods and API), specialty pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and OTC medicines. 
 All of our R&D activities are concentrated under one global group with overall responsibility for generics, specialty and biologics, enabling better focus and efficiency. We recently closed and sold a significant number of R&D facilities across all geographies, delivering efficiencies and substantial cost savings. During the past year, we conducted a thorough review of all R&D programs across the entire company, in generics and specialty, prioritizing core projects and terminating others, while maintaining a substantial pipeline. 
 A strong focus for Teva is the development of new generic medicines. We develop generic products for the United States, Europe and our International Markets segment. Our focus is on developing complex formulations with complex technologies, which have higher barriers to entry. Generic R&D activities, which are carried out in development centers located around the world, include product formulation, analytical method development, stability testing, management of bioequivalence, bio-analytical studies, other clinical studies and registration of 
 
14 


  generic drugs in all of the markets where we operate. We also operate several clinics where most of our bioequivalent studies are performed. We have more than 1,550 generic products in our pre-approved global pipeline, which includes products in all stages of the approval process: pre-submission, post-submission and after tentative approval. 
 In addition, our generic R&D supports our OTC business in developing OTC products, as well as in overseeing the work performed by contract developers. 
 Current R&D capabilities include solid oral dosage forms (such as tablets and capsules), inhalation, semi-solid and liquid formulations (such as ointments and creams), sterile formulations and other dosage forms, and delivery systems, such as matrix systems, special coating systems for sustained release products, orally disintegrating systems, sterile systems, such as vials, syringes and blow-fill-seal systems, and more recently, capability build-up in long-acting release injectable, transdermal patches, oral thin film, drug device combinations and nasal delivery systems. In addition, we are in the process of developing multiple AB-rated respiratory programs and devices for our long active injectable pipeline. 
 Our API R&D division focuses on the development of processes for the manufacturing of APIs, including intermediates, chemicals and fermentation products, for both our generic and proprietary drugs. Our facilities include two large development centers in India and Croatia, focusing on synthetic products, and three centers with specific expertise: a center in Hungary specializing in fermentation and semi-synthetic products, a center in Israel for oligonucleotides and a center in the Czech Republic for high-potency APIs. Our substantial investment in API R&D generates a steady flow of API products, supporting the timely introduction of generic products to market. The API R&D division also seeks methods to continuously reduce API production costs, enabling us to improve our cost structure. 
 Our specialty R&D product pipeline is focused on biologic products, biosimilar products and discovery of new biologic candidates. Specialty development activities include preclinical assessment (including toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacology studies), clinical development (including pharmacology and the design, execution and analysis of global safety and efficacy trials), as well as regulatory strategy to deliver registration of our pipeline products. 
 Our specialty R&D develops novel specialty products in our core therapeutic and disease focus areas. We have CNS projects in areas such as migraine, pain, movement disorders/neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry. Our respiratory projects are focused on asthma and COPD and include both novel compounds and delivery systems designed to address unmet patient needs. We also pursue select pipeline projects (e.g., biosimilars) in other therapeutic and disease areas that leverage our global R&D and commercial areas of expertise. 
 While our focus is on internal growth that leverages our R&D capabilities, we have entered into, and expect to pursue, in-licensing, acquisition and partnership opportunities to supplement and expand our existing specialty pipeline (e.g., the transactions with Celltrion, Eagle and Regeneron). In parallel, we evaluate and expand the development scope of our existing R&D pipeline products as well as our existing products for submission in additional markets. 
 Operations 
 We operate our business globally and believe that our global infrastructure provides us with the following capabilities and advantages: 
 

 | global R&D facilities that enable us to have a broad global generic pipeline and product line, as well as a focused pipeline of specialty products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities approved by the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities located around the world, which offer a broad range of production technologies and the ability to concentrate production in order to achieve high quality and economies of scale;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15 


 
 | API manufacturing capabilities that offer a stable, high-quality supply of key APIs, vertically integrated with our pharmaceutical operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | high-volume, technologically advanced distribution facilities that allow us to deliver new products to our customers quickly and efficiently, providing a cost-effective, safe and reliable supply.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These capabilities provide us with the means to respond on a global scale to a wide range of therapeutic and commercial requirements of patients, customers and healthcare providers. 
 Pharmaceutical Production 
 We operate 55 finished dosage and packaging pharmaceutical plants in 22 countries. These plants manufacture solid dosage forms, sterile injectables, liquids, semi-solids, inhalers, transdermal patches and medical devices. In 2018, we produced approximately 80 billion tablets and capsules and approximately 650 million sterile units. The FDA and EMA have approved 32 and 29 of our finished dosage manufacturing facilities, respectively. 
 Our primary manufacturing technologies, solid dosage forms, injectables and blow-fill-seal, are available in North America, Europe, Latin America and Israel. The manufacturing sites located in Israel, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, India, Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic make up the majority of our production capacity. 
 We use several external contract manufacturers to achieve operational and cost benefits. We continue to strengthen our third party operations unit to strategically work with our supplier base in order to meet cost, supply security and quality targets on a sustainable base in alignment with our global procurement organization. 
 Our policy is to maintain multiple supply sources for our strategic products and APIs to appropriately mitigate risk in our supply chain to the extent possible. However, our ability to do so may be limited by regulatory and other requirements. 
 In 2018, we closed or divested a significant number of manufacturing plants in Latin America, Europe, Israel and other markets in connection with implementation of our comprehensive restructuring plan announced in December 2017. 
 Raw Materials for Pharmaceutical Production 
 In general, we purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For some products, we purchase such raw materials and supplies from one source (the only source available to us) or a single source (the only approved source among many available to us), thereby requiring us to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source. We attempt, if possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. 
 We source a large portion of our APIs from our own manufacturing facilities. Additional APIs are purchased from suppliers located in Europe, Asia and the United States. We have implemented a supplier audit program to ensure that our suppliers meet our high standards and are able to fulfill the requirements of our global operations. 
 We currently have 18 API production facilities, producing approximately 300 APIs in various therapeutic areas. Our API intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 650 granted patents and pending applications worldwide. 
 We have expertise in a variety of production technologies, including chemical synthesis, semi-synthetic fermentation, enzymatic synthesis, high-potency manufacturing, plant extract technology, peptides synthesis, vitamin D derivatives synthesis and prostaglandins synthesis. Our advanced technology and expertise in the field of solid state particle technology enable us to meet specifications for particle size distribution, bulk density, specific surface area and polymorphism, as well as other characteristics. 
 
16 


 Our API facilities are required to comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements under U.S., European, Japanese and other applicable quality standards. Our API plants are regularly inspected by the FDA, European agencies and other authorities, as applicable. 
 Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary know-how and regulatory exclusivities, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We own or license numerous patents covering our products in the United States and other countries. We have also developed many brand names and own many trademarks covering our products. We consider the overall protection of our intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. We license or assign certain intellectual property rights to third parties in connection with certain business transactions. 
Environment, Health and Safety 
 We are committed to business practices that promote socially and environmentally responsible economic growth. During 2018, we continued to make significant progress on our multi-year plan towards our long-term environment, health and safety (EHS) goal referred to as Target Zero: zero incidents, zero injuries and zero releases. Among other things, in 2018, we: 

 | continued the implementation of our global EHS management system, which promotes proactive compliance with applicable EHS requirements, establishes EHS standards throughout our global operations and helps drive continuous improvement in our EHS performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provided EHS regulatory monitoring tools in all countries where we have significant operations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proactively evaluated EHS compliance through self-evaluation and an internal audit program, addressing non-conformities through appropriate corrective and preventative action.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quality 
 We are committed not only to complying with quality requirements but to developing and leveraging quality as a competitive advantage. In 2018, we successfully completed numerous inspections by various regulatory agencies of our finished dosage pharmaceutical plants and our pharmacovigilance function, continued discussions with authorities about drug shortages and participated in several industry-wide task forces. We continue to focus on maintaining a solid and sustainable quality compliance foundation, as well as making quality a priority beyond compliance. We seek to ensure that quality remains part of our corporate culture and is reflected in all of our operations, resulting in reliable and high quality products. 
 In 2018, we successfully resolved issues raised in an FDA warning letter in 2016 for our API production facility in China, following corrective actions addressing both the specific concerns raised by investigators as well as the underlying causes of those concerns. We resumed shipments from this facility in May 2017. 
 In January 2018, Celltrion received an FDA warning letter for its facility in Incheon, South Korea, our sole API source for AJOVY. All issues were resolved successfully and, in September 2018, we received FDA approval and launched AJOVY in the United States. 
 In July 2018, the FDA completed an inspection of our manufacturing plant in Davie, Florida in the United States, and issued a Form FDA-483 to the site. In October 2018, the FDA notified us that the inspection of the site is classified as official action indicated (OAI). On February 5, 2019, we received a warning letter from the FDA that contains four enumerated concerns related to production, quality control, and investigations at this site. We are working diligently to investigate the FDAs concerns in a manner consistent with current good 
 
17 


  manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, and to address those concerns as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. If we are unable to remediate the warning letter findings to the FDAs satisfaction, we may face additional consequences, including delays in FDA approval for future products from the site, financial implications due to loss of revenues, impairments, inventory write offs, customer penalties, idle capacity charges, costs of additional remediation and possible FDA enforcement action. We expect to generate approximately $255 million in revenues from this site in 2019, assuming remediation or enforcement does not cause any unscheduled slowdown or stoppage at the facility. 
 In July 2018, we announced the voluntary recall of valsartan and certain combination valsartan medicines in various countries due to the detection of trace amounts of a previously unknown impurity called NDMA found in valsartan API supplied to us by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical. Since July 2018, we have been actively engaged with regulatory agencies around the world in reviewing our valsartan and other sartan products for NDMA and other related impurities and, where necessary, have initiated additional voluntary recalls. The impact of this recall on our 2018 financial statements was $51 million, primarily related to inventory reserves. We expect to continue to experience loss of revenues and profits in connection with this matter. In addition, multiple lawsuits have been filed in connection with this matter. We may also incur customer penalties, impairments and litigation costs going forward. 
 Geographic Areas 
 Our business is conducted in many countries around the world and a significant portion of our revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. We operate our business through three segments: North America, Europe and International Markets. Each region manages our entire product portfolio, including generics, specialty and OTC products. The products we manufacture and sell around the world include many of those described above under Our Product Portfolio and Business Offering. 
 Investments and activities in some countries outside the Unites States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate in such countries may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Changes in the relative value of international currencies may also materially affect our results of operations. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1ARisk Factors. 
 Competition 
 Sales of generic medicines have benefitted from increasing awareness and acceptance on the part of healthcare insurers and institutions, consumers, physicians and pharmacists around the world. Factors contributing to this increased awareness are the passage of legislation permitting or encouraging generic substitution and the publication by regulatory authorities of lists of equivalent pharmaceuticals, which provide physicians and pharmacists with generic alternatives. In addition, various government agencies and many private managed care or insurance programs encourage the substitution of brand-name pharmaceuticals with generic products as a cost-savings measure in the purchase of, or reimbursement for, prescription pharmaceuticals. 
 In the United States, we are subject to competition in the generic drug market from domestic and international generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through lifecycle management initiatives, authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. An increase in FDA approvals for generic products is increasing the competition on our base generic products. Price competition from additional generic versions of the same product typically results in margin pressures, which is causing some generics companies to refocus their portfolio. 
 The European market continues to be ever more competitive, especially in terms of pricing, higher quality standards, customer service and portfolio relevance. We are one of only a few companies with a pan-European footprint, while most of our European competitors focus on a limited number of selected markets or business lines. Our leadership position in Europe allows us to be a reliable partner to fulfill the needs of patients, physicians, pharmacies, customers and payers. 
 
18 


 In our International Markets, our global scale and broad portfolio give us a significant competitive advantage over local competitors, allowing us to optimize our offerings through a combination of high quality medicines and unique go-to-market approaches. 
 Furthermore, in significant markets such as France, Japan and Russia, governments have issued or are in process of issuing regulations designed to increase generic penetration. Specifically, in Japan, ongoing regulatory pricing reductions and generic competition to off-patented products have negatively affected our sales in Japan. These conditions result in intense competition in the generic market, with generic companies competing for advantage based on pricing, time to market, reputation and customer service. 
 Our specialty medicines business faces intense competition from both specialty and generic pharmaceutical companies. The specialty business may continue to be affected by price reforms and changes in the political landscape, following recent public debate in the United States. We believe that our primary competitive advantages include our commercial marketing teams, global R&D capabilities, the body of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of our various medicines, our patient-centric solutions, physician and patient experience with our medicines and our medical capabilities, which are tailored to our product offerings, regional and local markets and the needs of our stakeholders. 
 Regulation 
 United States 
 Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration 
 All pharmaceutical manufacturers selling products in the United States are subject to extensive regulation by the United States federal government, principally by the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and, to a lesser extent, by state and local governments. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the development, manufacture, testing, safety, efficacy, labeling, approval, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, sale, import and export of our products. Our facilities are periodically inspected by the FDA, which has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Noncompliance with applicable requirements may result in fines, criminal penalties, civil injunction against shipment of products, recall and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, sale or import of products, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve NDAs, ANDAs or biologics license applications (BLAs) and criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice. The FDA also has the authority to deny or revoke approvals of marketing applications and the power to halt the operations of non-complying manufacturers. Any failure to comply with applicable FDA policies and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug (including generic versions of previously approved drugs) may be marketed, including new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved drugs. Applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to bioequivalence (for generics), safety, toxicity and efficacy (for new drugs), product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. FDA procedures generally require that commercial manufacturing equipment be used to produce test batches for FDA approval. The FDA also requires validation of manufacturing processes so that a company may market new products. The FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to implement these requirements. 
 The federal CSA and its implementing regulations establish a closed system of controlled substance distribution for legitimate handlers. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedulesSchedule I, II, III, IV, or Vwith varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Facilities that manufacture, distribute, conduct 
 
19 


  chemical analysis, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA inspects manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping and reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration and periodically thereafter. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. 
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (the Hatch-Waxman Act) established the procedures for obtaining FDA approval for generic forms of brand-name drugs. This act also provides market exclusivity provisions that can delay the approval of certain NDAs and ANDAs. One such provision allows a five-year period of data exclusivity for NDAs containing new chemical entities and a three-year period of market exclusivity for NDAs (including different dosage forms) containing new clinical trial(s) essential to the approval of the application. The Orphan Drug Act grants seven years of exclusive marketing rights to a specific drug for a specific orphan indication. The term orphan drug refers, generally, to a drug that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans. Market exclusivity provisions are distinct from patent protections and apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products. Another provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act extends certain patents for up to five years as compensation for the reduction of effective life of the patent which resulted from time spent in clinical trials and time spent by the FDA reviewing a drug application. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, any company submitting an ANDA or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (i.e., an NDA that, similar to an ANDA, relies, in whole or in part, on FDAs prior approval of another companys drug product; also known as a 505(b)(2) application) must make certain certifications with respect to the patent status of the drug for which it is seeking approval. In the event that such applicant plans to challenge the validity or enforceability of an existing listed patent or asserts that the proposed product does not infringe an existing listed patent, it files a Paragraph IV certification. In the case of ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a potential 180-day period of generic exclusivity for the first company to submit an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification. This filing triggers a regulatory process in which the FDA is required to delay the final approval of subsequently filed ANDAs containing Paragraph IV certifications until 180 days after the first commercial marketing. For both ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications, when litigation is brought by the patent holder, in response to this Paragraph IV certification, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months or a court decision finding the patent invalid, not infringed or unenforceable. Submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application with a Paragraph IV certification can result in protracted and expensive patent litigation. 
 Products manufactured outside the United States and marketed in the United States are subject to all of the above regulations, as well as to FDA, DEA and United States customs regulations at the port of entry. Products marketed outside the United States that are manufactured in the United States are additionally subject to various export statutes and regulations, as well as regulation by the country in which the products are to be sold. 
 Our products also include biopharmaceutical products that are comparable to brand-name biologics, but that are not approved as biosimilar versions of such brand-name products. While regulations are still being developed by the FDA relating to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which created a statutory pathway for the approval of biosimilar versions of brand-name biological products and a process to resolve patent disputes, the FDA has issued guidance to provide a roadmap for development of biosimilar products. 
 In August 2017, the FDA user fee reauthorization legislation, known as the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) was enacted in the United States. The agreements for pharmaceuticals, biosimilars and medical devices were negotiated with industry representatives over the course of 2016 to establish the amounts regulated companies would pay the FDA to support the product review process at the agency. Various fees must be paid by these manufacturers at different times, such as annually and with the submission of different types of applications. In return for this additional funding, the FDA has entered into agreements with each of the affected industries (known as the user fee agreements) that commit the agency to interacting with manufacturers and

  reviewing applications such as NDAs, ANDAs and BLAs in certain ways, and taking action on those applications at certain times. The agency is obligated to set specific timelines to communicate with companies, meet with company product sponsors during the review process and take action on their applications. On the generics side, FDARA established a new 180-day exclusivity for generic drugs that are no longer protected by exclusivity or patents, as well as new programs for enhanced and priority review of certain generic drug applications. On the branded side, this was the sixth agreement between the industry and the FDA. The user fee agreement for biosimilars was reauthorized for the second time as well. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Certain Government Programs 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) from 2010 represented the most significant health care reform in the United States in over thirty years. It was passed to require individuals to have health insurance and to control the rate of growth in healthcare spending through, among other things, stronger prevention and wellness measures, increased access to primary care, changes in healthcare delivery systems and the creation of health insurance exchanges. Enrollment in the health insurance exchanges began in October 2013. However, the individual mandate was subsequently repealed by Congress in the tax reform bill signed into law in December 2017. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. In December 2018, a U.S. federal district court ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional, but such decision has been stayed and will not take effect while such decision is on appeal. 
 The ACA requires the pharmaceutical industry to share in the costs of reform, by, among other things, increasing Medicaid rebates and expanding Medicaid rebates to cover Medicaid managed care programs. The ACA also included funding of pharmaceutical costs for Medicare patients in excess of the prescription drug coverage limit and below the catastrophic coverage threshold. Under the ACA, pharmaceutical companies are obligated to fund 50% of the patient obligation for branded prescription pharmaceuticals in this gap, or donut hole. Additionally, an excise tax was levied against certain branded pharmaceutical products. The tax is specified by statute to be approximately $3.5 billion in 2017, $4.2 billion in 2018 and $2.8 billion each year thereafter. The tax is to be apportioned to qualifying pharmaceutical companies based on an allocation of their governmental programs as a portion of total pharmaceutical government programs. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administer the Medicaid drug rebate program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers pay quarterly rebates to each state Medicaid agency. Generally, for generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, manufacturers (including Teva) are required to rebate 13% of the average manufacturer price, and for products marketed under NDAs or BLAs, manufacturers are required to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between such price and the best price during a specified period. An additional rebate for products marketed under NDAs or BLAs is payable if the average manufacturer price increases at a rate higher than inflation and other methodologies apply to new formulations of existing drugs. This provision was extended at the end of 2015 to cover generic drugs marketed under ANDAs as well. The Association for Accessible Medicines, the generic drug manufacturers trade association, is working to undo this policy as penalty on the industry and will continue to lobby for its abolishment. 
 In addition, the ACA revised certain definitions used for purposes of calculating the rebates, including the definition of average manufacturer price. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 contains language intended to exempt certain abuse-deterrent formulations of a drug from the definition of line extension for purposes of the program. 
 Various state Medicaid programs have implemented voluntary supplemental drug rebate programs that may provide states with additional manufacturer rebates in exchange for preferred status on a states formulary or for patient populations that are not included in the traditional Medicaid drug benefit coverage.

 Europe 
 General 
 In Europe, marketing authorizations for pharmaceutical products may be obtained either through a centralized procedure involving the EMA, a mutual recognition procedure which requires submission of applications in other member states following approval by a so-called reference member state, a decentralized procedure that entails simultaneous submission of applications to chosen member states or occasionally through a local national procedure. 
 During 2018, we continued to register products in the European Union, primarily using the decentralized procedure (simultaneous submission of applications to chosen member states). We continue to use, on occasion, the mutual recognition and centralized procedures. 
 The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market, but it also has the potential to create complexities affecting the entire European market. 
 In November 2017, the last part of the 2012 European Union regulation regarding pharmacovigilance was implemented, requiring centralized reporting in the European Union instead of individual country reporting. Under this regulation, all adverse events need to be reported regardless of severity. 
 European Union 
 The medicines regulatory framework of the European Union requires that medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved products, receive a marketing authorization before they can be placed on the market in the European Union. Authorizations are granted after a favorable assessment of quality, safety and efficacy by the respective health authorities. In order to obtain authorization, application must be made to the EMA or to the competent authority of the member state concerned. Besides various formal requirements, the application must contain the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, pre-clinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests and clinical trials. All of these tests must have been conducted in accordance with relevant European regulations and must allow the reviewer to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. 
 In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states of the European Union regulate the pricing of such products and in some cases limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services. These controls can result in considerable price differences among member states. 
 In addition to patent protection, exclusivity provisions in the European Union may prevent companies from applying for marketing approval for a generic product for eight years (or ten years for orphan medicinal products) from the date of the first marketing authorization of the original product in the European Union. Further, the generic product will be barred from market entry (marketing exclusivity) for a further two years, with the possibility of extending the market exclusivity by one additional year under certain circumstances. 
 The term of certain pharmaceutical patents may be extended in the European Union by up to five years upon grant of Supplementary Patent Certificates (SPC). The purpose of this extension is to increase effective patent life (i.e., the period between grant of a marketing authorization and patent expiry) to 15 years. 
 Subject to the respective pediatric regulation, the holder of an SPC may obtain a further patent term extension of up to six months under certain conditions. This six-month period cannot be claimed if the license holder claims a one-year extension of the period of marketing exclusivity based on the grounds that a new pediatric indication brings a significant clinical benefit in comparison with other existing therapies. 
 
22 


 Orphan designated products, which receive, under certain conditions, a blanket period of ten years of market exclusivity, may receive an additional two years of exclusivity instead of an extension of the SPC if the requirements of the pediatric regulation are met. 
 The legislation also allows for R&D work during the patent term for the purpose of developing and submitting registration dossiers. 
 In 2016, the United Kingdom conducted a referendum and voted to leave the European Union, also known as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the British government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union and, as a result, the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. The United Kingdom and European Union are currently in the process of defining their future relationship, but as pharmaceutical legislation in the United Kingdom is largely derived from European Union law and relies on mutual recognition of decision making, implementation of a number of practical steps is required before the United Kingdom exits the European Union. We are working on processes to ensure a smooth transition irrespective of the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. 
 International Markets 
 In addition to regulations in the United States and Europe, we, and our partners, are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products. Such regulations may be similar or, in some cases, more stringent than those applicable in the United States and Europe. 
 Whether or not we, or our partners, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of such product in those countries. The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we, and our partners, may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information. 
 If we, or our partners, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Miscellaneous Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to various national, regional and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions. We are also subject to country specific data protection laws and regulations applicable to the storage and processing of personal data around the world. In addition, we are subject to various national, regional and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the emission of material into the environment. We are also subject to various national, regional and local laws regulating how we interact with healthcare professionals and representatives of government that impact our promotional activities. 
 Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries around the world and may be introduced in additional countries in the future, although their application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.

 In October 2015, the European Commission adopted regulations providing detailed rules for the safety features appearing on the packaging of medicinal products for human use. This legislation, part of the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD), is intended to prevent counterfeit medicines entering into the supply chain and will allow wholesale distributors and others who supply medicines to the public to verify the authenticity of the medicine at the level of the individual pack. The safety features comprise a unique identifier and a tamper-evident seal on the outer packaging, which are to be applied to certain categories of medicines. FMD is effective as of February 2019. Tevas packing sites for the European market comply with this new requirement. 
 In November 2017, the federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act became effective in the United States, mandating an industry-wide, national serialization system for pharmaceutical packaging with a ten-year phase-in process. By November 2018, all manufacturers and re-packagers were required to mark each prescription drug package with a unique serialized code. We believe that Tevas packing sites for the U.S. market comply with this new requirement. Other countries are following suit with variations of two main requirements: (i) to be able to associate the unit data with the uniquely-identified shipping package, or (ii) to report the data for tracking and tracing of products, reimbursements and other purposes. Certain countries, such as Russia, China, Korea, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil and India (for exported products), already have laws mandating serialization and we are working to comply with these requirements. Other countries, including India (domestic market), Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and other Latin American countries are currently considering mandating similar requirements. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, Tevas work force consisted of 42,535 full-time-equivalent employees. In certain countries, we are party to collective bargaining agreements with certain groups of employees. 
 The following table presents our work force by geographic area: 
 

 | December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
United States | | 7,056 | | 8,807 | | 10,168
Europe | | 19,236 | | 22,352 | | 24,170
International Markets (excluding Israel) | | 11,351 | | 14,387 | | 15,759
Israel | | 4,893 | | 6,245 | | 6,863 
Total | | 42,535 | | 51,792 | | 56,960

 As part of our restructuring plan announced in December 2017, we are reducing approximately 25% of Tevas total work force by the end of 2019. The majority of these reductions occurred in 2018. Since the announcement of the restructuring plan, we reduced our global headcount by approximately 10,300 full-time-equivalent employees. Restructuring efforts are being conducted in accordance with applicable local requirements.
