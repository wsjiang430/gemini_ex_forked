Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading provider of outsourced digital services and next-generation customer experience to the world’s most innovative companies, helping our clients represent, protect and grow their brands. We serve our clients to support their end customers’ urgent needs, navigate an increasingly-complex compliance landscape, handle sensitive tasks, including online content moderation and enable artificial intelligence technology and automation. As of December 31, 2022, we served over 150 clients spanning established and emerging industry segments, including e-commerce, FinTech, food delivery and ride sharing, gaming, Technology, HealthTech, social media and streaming media.
Our global, omni-channel delivery model is focused on providing our clients three key services – Digital Customer Experience (“Digital CX”), Trust and Safety (formerly known as Content Security) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Services (formerly known as AI Operations).
Our delivery model is tailored to meet the needs of modern businesses and digital re-inventors. Our cloud-based technology infrastructure is designed to enable clients to set up operations quickly and seamlessly and allows clients to outsource many of their core processes throughout their company lifecycle. We use data science and process automation to achieve technology-driven efficiency gains.
We believe that prioritizing and investing in our frontline employees helps us better serve our clients. As we have expanded across the globe, we strive to champion our vision of operational excellence through an employee-centric culture everywhere we operate. As of December 31, 2022, our worldwide Headcount totaled approximately 49,500 people across 27 sites in 13 countries, including one country where operations are expected to start in 2023.
Growth Strategy
We intend to continue to grow by taking advantage of attractive and actionable opportunities, including:
Growing with our Current Clients: As our clients grow in size and the complexity of their outsourcing needs increases, we believe we have an opportunity to increase the addressable spend available to TaskUs. To capture this opportunity, we invest heavily in strategic account management and planning through our Client Services organization to deliver domain expertise, industry insight, and best practices. We use data science and front-line insights to identify new problems to solve, which we proactively present to clients. We believe these approaches unlock additional opportunities for work of greater complexity and importance. In 2022, 63 current clients signed new statements of work with us.
New Client Wins: We thoughtfully enter industry verticals, or sub-verticals, when we identify emerging trends or we see a sizable market where we can take significant share. We are well positioned across multiple commercial markets with substantial addressable spend opportunities where we target companies with a focus on digital transformation and employee engagement. We believe a brand associated with digital innovation is desired by companies wishing to be more agile and looking for a different breed of partner. We align our Sales and Client Services teams to industry verticals, which allows us to develop deep domain expertise to better attract and retain clients, understand their pain points, and provide superior solutions. We leverage our brand position and highly effective sales team to continue to diversify our client base and add more enterprise-class brands to our client list. We won 40 new clients in 2022, achieving a new client win rate of 43%.
Expanded Service Offerings: We aim to bolster our portfolio of highly complementary service capabilities by integrating consultative expertise, process automation, and technology that further expand our value proposition to clients. Services such as content moderation, anti-money laundering, fraud prevention, our breadth of AI Services and learning experience are areas we believe are particularly attractive and highly relevant for our forward-leaning client base.
Expanding Geographically: We plan to continue expanding our geographic footprint to drive growth. New geographies mean new languages and/or capabilities to offer to our clients and increasing opportunities to win new business. We have grown from 18 sites in eight countries in 2020 to 27 sites in 13 countries in 2022.
Pursuing Opportunistic M&A: We evaluate M&A opportunities to expand into higher value, specialized services, add new geographies or add additional capabilities to support our teammates in delivering exceptional service.

Solutions and Services
The TaskUs platform is purpose-built and organized around three service offerings: Digital Customer Experience, Trust and Safety and Artificial Intelligence Services. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Digital Customer Experience, Trust and Safety and Artificial Intelligence Services represented 66%, 19% and 15%, respectively, of our total service revenue of $960.5 million compared to 64%, 22% and 14%, respectively, of our total service revenue of $760.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Digital Customer Experience
Our digitally native service offerings enable us to utilize lower cost non-voice channels. We leverage chat, social, in-app support, SMS, and in-platform solutions and apply an “automation first” mentality to our client engagements. In 2022, 88% of our Digital CX revenues were generated from non-voice, digital channels or omni-channel services, while the remaining 12% were generated purely from voice channels; even our pure voice work is supported by cloud-based infrastructure. 
Engagement Lifecycle: When we begin a Digital CX engagement, we often lead with our consulting group. They bring deep expertise in channel strategy, tool selection, talent enablement and operations optimization. Once we have established an operating framework, our Implementations and Operations teams are brought in to build the project plan and execute the strategy. We identify the critical key performance indicators (“KPIs”) which define success and provide a roadmap for continuous improvement and implement them in real-time management dashboards. We execute these solutions through our team of highly-trained and dedicated omni-channel service experts, whom we call teammates. We create a deep connection between our teammates and our clients—we become brand ambassadors for our clients and are deeply integrated in their workflows. Their success is our success.
Our Digital Customer Experience solutions include:
Omni-Channel Customer Care: Protecting and maintaining our clients’ brands makes up a significant portion of our Digital CX services. We differentiate our performance with our focus on driving efficiency, based on frontline insights and advanced analytics, so our teammates can deliver higher value services and our culture of employee engagement enhances the customer experience they provide.
Learning Experience: TaskUs provides the curricula, training processes, e-Learning systems, and programs that enable global brands to scale operations, make impactful decisions, build smarter process flows and create high-performing teams.
New Product or Market Launches: Our clients are often in a high-stakes race to get a new product launched or enter a new market. We operate as an extension of our clients’ in-house teams delivering key market insights, speed and agility, and frontline feedback on the true customer experience so they can adapt and win quickly in new initiatives.
Customer Acquisition: TaskUs supports outbound sales, lead research, lead generation, appointment setting, new customer outreach and activation, retention, and advanced customer conversion from free and low cost subscription/product offerings to offerings of higher value and profitability.
TaskUs Digital CX Consulting: TaskUs Consulting Group provides a broader suite of services to our innovative clients that need assistance designing their customer experience programs and optimizing their operating environments. TaskUs Consulting Group offers the following areas of consulting expertise:
•Digital Customer Experience Strategy: customer journey mapping, channel strategy, chat bot and automation strategy.
•Operational Excellence: workflow and process mapping, best practice analysis on workforce, quality and analytics.
•Technology Assessment & Recommendations: tool evaluation, selection and implementation services.
Trust and Safety
Our Trust and Safety offering is focused on helping our clients protect their users, enabling them to maintain trust by creating a safe environment for users to interact.
Global Policy Management: Our Trust and Safety organization partners with our clients to apply best practices to policy development and distribution, product design, quality, and training. As a result of government regulations and cultural norms, online platforms must maintain increasingly distinct content policies in different geographies. These policies are dynamically updated in response to the latest threats and evolving bad actor behavior. TaskUs advises and supports clients’ policy development, and provides distribution and policy training.
Tools and Innovation: The tools used by employees providing Trust and Safety services have a significant impact on efficiency, accuracy and quality. We partner with our clients to customize these tool sets and have developed proprietary technology to improve our own productivity and accuracy. Finally, our quality and training organization reviews employee 
Table of Contents

decisions in an ongoing fashion, in order to close the feedback loop through coaching and performance management. We intend to continue devoting significant resources to these dedicated Trust and Safety and wellness teams.
Trust and Safety consists of two primary areas of service: Content Moderation and Risk and Response.
Content Moderation
Content Moderation pertains to the review and disposition of user and advertiser generated content, which may include removal or labeling of policy violating, offensive or misleading content. These services rely on a combination of AI and human experts to review and remove offensive content. We have also developed proprietary technology that our Content Moderation teams use to improve their efficiency and accuracy and a comprehensive program to support the wellness of front-line teammates.
AI can be leveraged effectively to remove text that is commonly understood to be objectionable and images that have previously been marked as offensive. Human Content Moderation experts step in to discern context, parse novel slang, and identify images that have been modified to intentionally avoid detection. As a result of increasingly complex and nuanced policies, decisions are often ambiguous and nuanced, requiring Content Moderation experts to possess deep domain knowledge as well as broad cultural and market expertise.
We are developing and enforcing Content Moderation policies in several areas, including intellectual property, job and commerce postings, objectionable material, political advertising, dating apps and digital marketplaces and gaming platforms.
Highlights of our Content Moderation services include:
TaskUs Wellness + Resiliency Department: is a global leader in employee success and wellness, leveraging clinician-led and research-based health and safety programs, providing true end-to-end support and superior employee benefits. It is our utmost priority to reduce employee risks related to mental health, promote productivity and engagement, and continuously improve the TaskUs workspace by addressing the eight dimensions of wellness. The Wellness + Resiliency Department is committed to providing individual coaching or counseling, psychoeducational outreach, group coaching sessions, leadership development, and on-demand wellness resources. We offer the following:
•Global Life Coaching: We partner with employees in their pursuit of personal well-being through transformative coaching conversations.
•The Resiliency Studio: A psychological health and safety program providing innovative interventions to bolster brain health and protect employees from the potential effects of content moderation.
•Division of Wellness + Resiliency Research: We have a dedicated behavioral health research team committed to enhancing employees’ mental health through innovative research and enhanced data collection.
•Advanced Services, Consulting, and Technology: We leverage our expertise to help companies assess, create, and deploy culturally competent and comprehensive programming and tools.
Risk and Response
As the economy becomes increasingly digital, the risk of fraud and financial crime grows significantly. Industries including ride-sharing, gaming, online dating, FinTech, streaming media and e-commerce sites are forced to spend time addressing bad-actors on their platforms. We position our most skilled teammates to perform the critical support needed to protect end users, detect and eliminate fraud, address unwanted user activity, and manage regulatory compliance. Our Risk and Response services include:
•Identity: Our identity solutions help safeguard client platforms while accounting for and servicing know-your-customer (“KYC”) and know-your-business (“KYB”) requirements. We verify the identity of new users, sellers, merchants, and other third parties like hosts and drivers, and support the due diligence process for businesses and higher-risk customers.
•Compliance: Our compliance solutions simplify regulatory complexity. We deploy and scale Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (“AML/CFT”) compliance, sanctions screening, and enhanced due diligence teams and respond to regulatory changes over time.
•Fraud: We monitor platform activity for signs of fraud and respond to user-reported complaints, escalating high-priority matters for immediate review. Our fraud investigators identify systemic threats and manage cases to maintain tolerance limits. We deploy workflows, automation, and case management tools to quickly process chargebacks and disputes, and validate transactions.
•Digital Transformation: We build automation technology into our solutions to deliver better quality outcomes faster, improve efficiency and reduce risks.

Artificial Intelligence Services
Intelligent applications based on Artificial Intelligence are a key facet of digital innovation. AI applications are created by annotating datasets to train an algorithm in a process called Machine Learning. We first began supporting AI applications over a decade ago, including next-generation product development efforts such as transcribing voicemail messages for visual voicemail solutions and manually scoring the sentiment of social media posts for social listening tools. Today, our AI Services have increased in sophistication and complexity as AI applications have evolved, and we have invested in digital innovation to meet the growing demand in this service offering.
Our Artificial Intelligence Services solutions include:
Data Annotation: We refine large sets of training data for our clients by annotating videos, photos, audio clips and text based on their policy specifications. The quality of this training data is based on the accuracy of our annotation and plays a large role in the success of the resulting AI algorithm.
 Examples of the applications that Data Annotation powers include:
Computer Vision: Algorithms which allow a computer to “see” the world require millions of labeled images. For mission critical applications such as autonomous vehicles these images often must be labeled down to a single pixel.
Natural Language Processing: To understand the meaning of phrases, algorithms are trained with large sets of written text that has been annotated based on parts of speech, meaning and sentiment.
Video Processing: Understanding videos requires the segmentation and recombination of two distinct training data sets—audio and visual. The audio file must be transcribed and annotated to enable Natural Language Processing and objects in the image files must be tagged to enable Computer Vision.
Sensor Processing: Refining algorithms which make decisions based on sensor data requires annotated sets of sensor data from sources such as the LiDAR systems of autonomous vehicles.
We group our algorithm training services into three phases: learning, generalizing, and predicting. Each of the three phases of development requires distinct support methodologies including quality, training, and knowledge management.
Beyond Data Annotation: We have begun moving up the value chain in AI Services to troubleshooting and remediation of AI applications online and in the field. Our future vision includes supporting algorithms for facial recognition, teaching new autonomous vehicles like drones to fly, identifying bullying in real-time on live gaming platforms, reading MRIs and x-rays accurately and helping to automatically detect cyber-security attacks; among many others.
Sales and Marketing
*Deal duration reflects the number of days between the creation of an opportunity in our opportunity management system and when a contract is signed or lost. This includes opportunities for both New Clients and Existing Clients.
We believe TaskUs has developed a strong reputation for its work with recognizable technology companies. Our sales team is organized in industry verticals to understand the unique needs of our prospects. We use our industry expertise serving 
Table of Contents

the digital economy to attract new innovators, big tech and enterprise companies looking to transform and innovate. We develop thesis-led prospecting strategies, and apply a multi-faceted pipeline generation process to drive engagement with our target clients. We invite them to our conferences, share value-added content and host them at events and virtual “meetups” in an effort to build genuine relationships as their trusted advisors.
Community Driven Marketing: Our marketing efforts are focused on leveraging our community and creating an ecosystem where prospects can engage with us and learn about our value proposition.
•CX Summit: Twice a year, we host a conference with hundreds of customer experience professionals, both clients and future clients of TaskUs. The summit features keynote speakers sharing their experiences and best practices, and roundtable discussions where leaders can connect with other leaders. On occasion these events are held virtually, or a hybrid of virtual and in-person, and over time have become increasingly global in nature.
•CX Meets: A smaller more intimate format where we connect leaders with leaders around the TaskUs brand.
•Trust and Safety Summits: Thought leadership events where we host or sponsor industry thought leaders, addressing regulation, fraud, bad actors, policy making and wellness.
•Ridiculously Good Dinners: We have hosted many dinners bringing together founders and C-suite level executives of notable technology companies.
•Ridiculously Good Events: We invite VIPs in our community to get to know us and each other through unique experiences. We believe these events contribute to significant new opportunities and goodwill with our prospects.
Effective and Highly-Efficient: We maintain an effective and efficient sales operating model by using industry-leading tools and a highly leveraged offshore sales support model. The TaskUs sales approach is based on modern SaaS industry sales models versus classic outsourcing models which tend to be “top heavy.” We believe we have created a scalable sales engine that doesn’t rely on “rainmakers” alone, but leverages junior level sales talent developed in-house to create effective sales teams. Vertically aligned business development representatives triage marketing qualified leads, perform outbound outreach to prospects, and generate pipeline while our sales executives and vice presidents focus on deal closure and value delivery. These teams take advantage of skilled proposal, marketing and demand generation resources offshore for support. We believe this approach lowers the total cost of sales and creates repeatability and sustainability by maintaining the entire sales funnel at all times.
Delivery and Operations
TaskUs operations are designed for agility and scale, with perpetual experimentation and iteration, and a devotion to data-driven decision making. We are comfortable operating for growth-stage companies with little outsourcing experience, or taking on scaled operations from some of the world’s largest enterprises and technology companies which are highly standardized and outcome driven. We work with our clients to understand their objectives and design the most efficient process to meet and exceed these goals. In our 2022 cNPS Survey, 81% of all respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their programs’ operational performance expectations are regularly met. To deliver to these standards we offer:
•Subject Matter Expertise: We have “SME” teams in each of our primary services—Digital Customer Experience, Trust and Safety and Artificial Intelligence Operations. 
•Project Management Organization: Our “PMO” is the linchpin between sales and operations, leading the launch process to plan, execute and deliver for client success. 
Table of Contents

•Modern Service Excellence: We use real-time dashboards, via our PowerUs platform, and KPI management to meet and exceed our clients’ expectations. Our process discipline has allowed us to achieve multiple certifications and compliance standards including Service Organization Report (“SOC 2 Type 2”), HIPAA and PCI-DSS.
•Agile Automation: There are often opportunities to continuously improve our efficiency and quality with our own technology. Our Digital Innovation team focuses on rapid prototyping using lightweight technical solutions like browser based extensions, robotic process automation, and productivity and workflow analytics.
•Data Science and Analytics: Our Business Intelligence teams apply data science to client data to drive insights back into our operations in a cycle of continuous improvement.
At the core of our operations are scaled teams of employees, our TaskUs teammates. These individuals ultimately determine the quality of service we provide our clients and, as such, we are obsessive about the standards of our frontline teammates and our team leaders, the first level of management. We have organized our global operating model around our sites, which are run by operations leaders, who act as “Site CEOs.” Our operations are supported by centralized shared services based in the Philippines and India. Each of our sites has at least one leader on-site from each of our support functions, including Human Resources, Workforce Management and Information Technology. The combination of onsite leadership with scaled shared services allows us to support our Site CEO model in a cost effective manner and execute processes with the appropriate consistency globally while accounting for local nuance.
In 2022, we launched PowerUs to streamline and document tried and tested industry practices while balancing global consistency and local compatibility. By simplifying our processes, documenting our standards, and certifying people in their role, our teammates are empowered to work more efficiently on critical tasks and on innovative ideas that will help drive our growth and success. We anchored our work in PowerUs around three pillars: People, Process and Technology. We have certified teammates in various support functions and were able to promote a large portion of our frontline leadership through Academy, our initiative which helps drive retention, create a career path and promote our unique culture. We introduced new platforms for managing workforce, quality and Learning Experience. We believe these enhancements have driven efficiencies through the business, reduction in client complaints and enhanced employee experience. We hope to certify additional frontline leaders on best in class processes, and expect that our continued focus on PowerUs will drive efficiencies, best in class operations delivery and win more business. 
Utilizing primarily offshore and near-shore markets is a central tenet of our service delivery strategy. Since 92% of our revenue in 2022 was delivered from non-voice, digital channels or omni-channel services, we are particularly well positioned to leverage an off-shore/near-shore model. As of December 31, 2022, we provided our services through a network of 27 locations in 13 countries, including one country where operations are expected to start in 2023, and had Headcount of approximately 49,500 people worldwide. The Philippines is our largest off-shore market with approximately 31,800 people, or 64% of total Headcount. 
In addition to our on-site operations, we utilize an internally developed cloud-based operating model, Cirrus, which is customized to each of our geographies and enables our employees to deliver services remotely on behalf of our clients. With hybrid working becoming more common, our Cirrus strategy follows our client needs with some clients deciding to work 100% remotely and other clients utilizing a hybrid model. At TaskUs we have a tethered or hub and spoke model with sites where we can bring employees for orientation, training and team activities, but allows them to work from home predominantly. This allows TaskUs to tap into a wider talent pool. As of December 31, 2022, more than 50% of our teammates were working 100% remotely or utilizing a hybrid model.
We primarily delivered services remotely at the beginning of 2022 and slowly returned to a more hybrid model based on client and geographic needs as COVID-19 restrictions eased during the course of the year. We onboarded a new global leader for Cirrus and we will continue to transform our teammate experience by investing in bespoke tools that will promote the unique culture of TaskUs. This will ultimately support superior delivery to our clients and enhance retention rates for our frontline teammates. Given the recent shift to work-from-home at TaskUs, we expect our Cirrus Work@Home platform to be a meaningful part of our future delivery model.
We also leverage TaskVerse, launched in 2021, a centralized platform to source, recruit, and manage freelancers or “Taskers” from anywhere around the world. In addition to our full-time and in-house dedicated TaskUs Teammates, Taskers take on tasks such as audio transcription, image annotation, and data collection, among others. With the ability to work flexible hours from anywhere, TaskVerse opens a new dimension to attract, access and engage with the best global talent. During 2022, we executed numerous projects for multiple clients leveraging TaskVerse. As AI becomes more sophisticated and its applications become more global it can require data sets that are annotated by people who speak various languages and come from varying backgrounds and cultures. We believe that the TaskVerse platform could help us supplement our capabilities to meet these needs. We expect to continue to grow TaskVerse through continued improvement of platform capabilities, the launch of a dedicated mobile app and enhanced integration with data labeling partners.

Human Capital
We believe that serving frontline employees helps us to better serve our clients. We believe clients choose TaskUs in part because they view our company culture as aligned with their own, which enables us to act as a natural extension of their brands and gives us an advantage in the recruitment of highly engaged frontline teammates who produce better results. 
Our philosophy is simple: treat people well and they will deliver a better end customer experience which leads to happy clients and a thriving business. Our employees are the core of our business. Our success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain sufficient numbers of employees in a timely fashion at our sites to support our operations. Our employee-centric culture, our focus on employee wellness and satisfaction and our employee-centric site selection enable us to meet that challenge and motivate our employees to stay for the long term. Our happy, motivated and hardworking employees in turn produce high-quality work for our clients.
We continually work on our company culture like it is a product we sell in the market, by listening to our employees like we listen to our clients. We leverage this feedback to drive continuous improvement and conduct quality control to ensure global consistency. Our primary culture-related goal metric is eNPS, the single most important barometer we use to measure employee engagement. In 2022, our eNPS was 65, and 75% of our employees who participated rated us 9 or 10 on a scale of 10. 
Our ability to maintain high eNPS scores enables us to drive real business impact. We believe it drives improved attendance as our teammates show up on time and excited to work. We believe happy employees deliver better results and higher retention. The voluntary attrition rate for employees who were employed by TaskUs for more than 180 days was 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Diversity
Our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is deeply rooted in our culture and our core values. We believe that a truly Ridiculous team is one where each individual brings a unique perspective to the table, and that the best results are 
Table of Contents

achieved when people feel safe and empowered to be their authentic self. We aim to drive innovation and a higher business performance by focusing on the following pillars:
•Inclusive Hiring: welcoming talent from all walks of life, and sourcing talent from diverse backgrounds.
•Inclusive Practices: ensuring our practices and processes enable our leaders to make inclusive decisions.
•Inclusive Culture: nurturing an inclusive environment where we celebrate uniqueness and where everyone feels comfortable and appreciated by being their authentic self, including Employee Resource Groups to educate, drive change and foster collaboration in the workplace.
•Community Outreach: giving back and supporting the communities in which we operate.
In 2022, we relaunched our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) global strategy. We continued to drive education and awareness for our Global Communities of Focus: Women, LGBTQ+, Disabilities and Ethnic Diversity in the U.S., through various events with global and local scope, such as roundtable discussions with leaders and experts inside and outside of TaskUs, global learning sessions and discussion panels. 
We launched a Global DEI dashboard, with the intent to understand the distribution and movement of our diverse talent, and drive our decisions based on data. In 2022, we also launched the first Global DEI Survey to understand our employees’ experience of inclusion, and determine our priorities for 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, women made up 51% of our workforce and 47% of our managers at all levels.
Our Clients
As of December 31, 2022, we served over 150 clients, the majority of which are innovative technology companies in attractive, high growth industry verticals, including social media, e-commerce, gaming, streaming media, food delivery and ride sharing, Technology, FinTech and HealthTech. We work with a broad range of clients in different stages of their lifecycle, ranging from start-up companies to well-capitalized and established public companies with scaled operations. Our top 10 and top 20 clients accounted for 58% and 72% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Our largest client, Meta, and our second largest client, DoorDash, generated 22% and less than 10% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. We have multiple agreements across several lines of business with our largest and second largest clients, which generally include a description of the services provided by TaskUs, invoicing and payment terms, the number of TaskUs employees to be assigned to a given campaign in each location in which the work is performed, client obligations for providing headcount forecasting and notice in the event of an increase or decrease in volume, and renewal and termination provisions, including termination for convenience subject to advance notice requirements of varying length. Under these agreements, our service fees are generally subject to minimums and maximums, depending on whether the actual volume of services provided falls below or exceeds periodic volume forecasts provided by these clients.
Our Competition
We compete in a large and fragmented market. We believe the principal competitive factors in our business include vendor company culture; ability to act as partners and support innovation; quality of personnel and service; breadth of offering; scalability and global coverage; ability to apply technology to improve efficiency and quality; and pricing.
We identify emerging industry verticals or those going through transformative changes, and we find attractive sub-segments to address these clients’ needs. We have a demonstrated track record of rapidly scaling in the industries that we target. Unlike traditional outsourced providers, whose voice-based solutions largely cater to telecommunications, cable and financial services companies, we provide a global, omni-channel delivery model focused on supporting digital solutions. We believe companies choose TaskUs because of our deep expertise in working with the world’s most innovative companies, corporate culture, leading employee wellness programs, high quality teammates and strong employee engagement, understanding of complex and rapidly changing industry dynamics, differentiated tech-enabled offerings combined with value added consulting services, and proven ability to rapidly scale.
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our proprietary technology and intellectual property, including our proprietary processes and know-how. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our knowledge and capabilities, and to create specialized solutions for our clients. We rely on a combination of laws, security and confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information.
We require our employees to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all deliverables and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services, including the intellectual property rights therein. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential.
Table of Contents

We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our clients. These customary agreements cover our use of our clients’ software systems and platforms as our clients often own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them. Furthermore, we sometimes grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable and irrevocable license to our clients to use our pre-existing intellectual property, but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we develop for them.
We have registered or are registering various trademarks and service marks in the United States and other countries, including for “TaskUs.” In some countries we also have common law rights to certain trademarks and service marks, including “TaskUs.” Our ability to obtain trademark registrations varies from country to country, as does the duration of trademark and service mark registrations, which may generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the marks are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.
We also have and maintain certain trade secrets arising out of the authorship or creation of proprietary applications, systems and business practices. Confidentiality is maintained primarily through contractual clauses, and in the case of computer programs and information maintained in our electronic systems and networks, system access controls, tracking and authorization processes.
Our Technology
We maintain an innovative, flexible, scalable, resilient, and reliable technology infrastructure that helps us deliver our services and solutions to our clients. We utilize what we believe are industry-leading hardware and software components to provide for and enable the rapid growth of our business. Maintaining the integrity and security of our technology infrastructure is critical to our business, and as such we leverage what we believe are industry-leading and sophisticated security and monitoring tools to promote security and continued performance across our network. 
The cloud-based technology supporting our services and solutions is flexible and scalable, and designed according to our clients’ needs. We also integrate with our clients’ existing platforms where required in order to deliver our services and solutions anywhere our clients need them.
Our strong operational standards and metrics emphasize operational excellence and data analytics to improve our performance and provide better results for our clients. For example, we build custom dashboards for our clients to provide real-time data insights, removing the need to wait for monthly reports. Our custom dashboards are one way we use technology to differentiate ourselves from competitors and to drive efficiency and build trust with our clients.
Our physical network is maintained by a high-quality infrastructure and networking organization, which consists of people around the world who are dedicated to pursuing seamless, uninterrupted service delivery to our clients. In addition, we have dedicated security and compliance professionals responsible for cyber security, fraud, and compliance.
Regulation
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve data privacy and security, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, export controls, economic sanctions and other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that are contradictory to each other, and/or could harm our business. In addition, the terms of our service contracts typically require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In some of our service contracts, we are contractually required to comply even if such laws and regulations apply to our clients, but not to us, and sometimes our clients require us to take specific steps intended to make it easier for our clients to comply with requirements that are applicable to them. If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we may be restricted in our ability to provide services, and may also be the subject of civil or criminal actions involving penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state, as well as international laws and regulations, including those regarding data privacy and security, and we or our clients may be subject to regulations related to the processing of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Tax
Several of our sites located within special economic zones in the Philippines benefit from favorable tax treatment provided by registrations with Philippine Economic Zone Authority (“PEZA”) and the Philippine Board of Investment (“BOI”). These benefits vary from site to site and may include income tax holidays, reduced income taxes, and reduced VAT. Under the PEZA/BOI registrations, favorable tax treatment for certain of our PEZA-registered sites expired, but may be renewed for subsequent periods provided we meet the criteria for Net Foreign Exchange Earnings (“NFEE”) and Capital Equipment Labor Ratio (“CELR”). While we believe the ability to meet these requirements is within our control, there can be no assurance that we will retain these benefits in the future.
Table of Contents

The initial term including the subsequent extensions of the income tax holiday (“ITH”) for three of our sites has expired. One of our sites expired as of July 2021; a second site expired in December 2021 and a third site expired in September 2022. All three sites with expired ITH were granted reduced income tax rates of 5% based on gross income and will end by April 2031. A fourth site’s initial term of ITH expired in November 2022 and was granted a one year ITH extension ending in November 2023. We continue to engage with PEZA/BOI in order to meet the necessary criteria for favorable tax treatment and plan to file the extension applications before the due date of the fourth site. We have one site registered with the BOI which has been granted a five-year ITH beginning from the anticipated 2023 start date of its commercial operations.

We are subject to state, federal and international laws and regulations that require us to maintain the privacy and security of personally identifiable information that we process, including General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, as amended, and related regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Our legal and information security teams are responsible for overseeing our data protection strategy and implementation to monitor our compliance with such laws and regulations, including by managing, implementing, and overseeing internal privacy policies and security measures, such as the regular monitoring and testing of systems and equipment. We are also subject to the self-regulatory standards that require companies that process payment card data to implement certain data security measures. 
HIPAA 
Certain clients require solutions that ensure security due to nature of the content being distributed and associated applicable regulatory requirements. In particular, our employees may access protected health information, which triggers our required compliance with HIPAA. HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting protected health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates, like us, to develop and maintain policies with respect to the protection of, and use the disclosure of electronic protected health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information, and to follow certain notification requirements in the event of a breach. Violations of HIPAA may result in significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose protected health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. As a “business associate,” we are directly liable for compliance with HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. We also have obligations under the business associate agreements that we are required to enter into with certain clients that are covered by HIPAA and certain subcontractors that we engage in connection with our business operations.
Content Moderation
Certain laws may apply to content moderation, such as laws regulating hate speech on the internet. Governments may seek to impose additional regulations moderating content on the internet. These laws are currently the subject of significant debate, and we expect that these laws will continue to evolve and change over time.
Anti-Corruption
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits United States businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements.
Globally, other countries in which we operate have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA, such as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in the Philippines and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, all of which prohibit companies and their intermediaries from bribing government officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices, although adherence to local customs and practices is generally not a defense under United States and

other anti-bribery laws. We maintain a Global Code of Conduct and various other policies against bribery and corruption, and train and monitor our employees to act in accordance with these policies.
