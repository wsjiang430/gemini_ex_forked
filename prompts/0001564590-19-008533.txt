Skin and Hair Care Products 
 The principal products in our skin and hair care products segment include:
  
• | Alpha® Skin Care products;
--+---------------------------


• | Prell® Shampoo and Conditioner;
--+--------------------------------


• | Denorex® Shampoo and Conditioner;
--+----------------------------------

--+---------------------

 Our Alpha® Skin Care brand was one of the first to use alpha hydroxy acids (“AHAs”), and feature facial care products, a body lotion, and a body wash. Products containing AHAs gently slough off dead skin cells to promote a healthier, more youthful appearance and help to diminish fine lines and wrinkles.
 In 2016, we acquired the Prell®, Denorex® and Zincon® brands of hair and scalp care products. Prell® Shampoo, an iconic brand since 1947, is a classic clean shampoo for healthy hair. Our Denorex® products are dermatologist-recommended medicated shampoos and conditioners to control the symptoms of dandruff and other scalp conditions. Our Zincon® product is a medicated anti-dandruff shampoo.
 Since 2001, we have been the exclusive distributor in the United States for face and other skin care masque sachets manufactured by Montagne Jeunesse International Ltd. (“Montagne Jeunesse”). These masque sachets are currently sold under the trade name 7th Heaven. These masques are sold for single use in a wide assortment of types and fragrances.
 We have been a distributor in the United States for Batiste Dry Shampoo since 2009. Under our distribution agreement with the manufacturer of Batiste Dry Shampoo, Church & Dwight Co. Inc. (“Church & Dwight”), we are the exclusive distributor in the United States of Batiste Dry Shampoo in the specialty retailer channel.  The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta Beauty, Inc. (“Ulta”), our second largest customer, apparel retailers, and department stores. Dry shampoo is a quick and convenient way to refresh hair between washes.
 Marketing and Distribution 
 We primarily market our products through: (1) trade promotions to support price features, displays, slotting fees and other merchandising of our products by our retail customers; (2) consumer incentives such as coupons and rebates; and (3) consumer marketing in print, social and digital media and television advertising. 
 Our products are sold nationally and internationally (Canada and China), directly through our sales force and indirectly through independent brokers and manufacturer’s representatives, to mass merchandisers, drugstores, supermarkets, hardware stores, e-commerce retailers, and other retail outlets and to wholesale distributors.
 The table set forth below shows net sales to our significant customers as a percentage of segment and consolidated net sales during 2018 and 2017:
 
 
 | % of Net Sales | 
--------------------------+----------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart") | | 27 | % | | 26 | %
Ulta | | 24 | % | | 22 | %
HK NFS Limited ("HK NFS") | | 17 | % | | 0 | %

 As is typical in our industry, we do not have a long-term contract with Walmart, Ulta, or any other retail customer.
 We also use our websites for sales of our products directly to consumers. These sales accounted for approximately 2% of total net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Currently, our international sales are made to distributors who are responsible for the selling and marketing of the products, and we are paid for these products in United States dollars or in Canadian dollars.

From time to time, our customers return products to us. For our household products, we permit returns only for a limited time. For our skin and hair care products, returns are accepted for a greater period of time in order to maintain or enhance our relationship with the customer. Typically, customers are granted a credit equal to the original sale price plus a handling charge. 
 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We own and operate all of our manufacturing equipment. We manufacture all of our principal products at our facility located in Denver, Colorado, with the exception of the products where we are the distributor. We maintain sufficient inventories of all of our products to ship orders as they are received, and we believe that our physical plant facilities are adequate for the foreseeable future.
 We believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of our major products. However, we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers and any supplier contracts may be terminated at any time. We believe that we have good relationships with all of our suppliers. 
 Under our distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse, we are the exclusive distributor of 7th Heaven skin care sachets in the United States. The current term of our distribution agreement expires on September 15, 2019. Our distribution agreement with Montagne Jeunesse automatically renews for an additional two-year term and will continue to automatically renew unless terminated at the end of any such term upon six months prior notice. Under the terms of the distribution agreement, we agreed to develop, promote and sell the products in the United States. The initial pricing terms for the products were negotiated with Montagne Jeunesse. Any changes to the prices must be mutually agreed to by both parties and must be agreed to at least six months in advance. Effective March 14, 2019, we mutually agreed with Montagne Jeunesse to extend the renewal notice period by three months to allow the parties additional time to negotiate certain terms of the extended agreement.
 Under our distribution agreement with Church & Dwight, we are the exclusive distributor of Batiste Dry Shampoo products in the specialty retailer channel in the United States. The specialty retailer channel includes primarily beauty supply stores, such as Ulta, apparel retailers and department stores. Church & Dwight retained the rights to sell Batiste products to the remainder of the market in the United States. The distribution agreement with Church & Dwight provides that we will not be permitted to manufacture, distribute or sell any products that are competitive with Batiste Dry Shampoo products. The initial pricing terms for the Batiste products were negotiated with Church & Dwight but may be increased by Church & Dwight at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice of any price increase. The term of the distribution agreement with Church & Dwight runs through December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms until it is terminated by either party upon 30 days’ prior written notice.
 Competition
 Both the household and skin and hair care product categories are highly competitive and innovative. We compete in both categories against a range of competitors, most of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources, name recognition, innovation capabilities, and product and market diversification than us. We compete in both categories primarily on the basis of quality, brand recognition, and the distinguishing characteristics of our products. The wood care product category is dominated by a small number of companies that are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products. In the skin and hair care category, several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and each of these competitors produces several competing products.
Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the types of consumer products that we manufacture and sell. Many chemicals used in consumer products, some of which are used in several of our product formulations, have come under scrutiny by various state governments and the Federal government. These chemicals are called volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”). All of our products currently meet the most stringent VOC regulations and may be sold throughout the United States. Many of our skin care products, several of which contain AHAs, are considered cosmetics within the definition of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”). Our cosmetic products are subject to the regulations under the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The relevant laws and regulations are enforced by the FDA. We believe that we are producing and marketing all of our products in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the markets in which we participate.
 Our production facility is also subject to Federal, state, and local regulations governing water quality, air quality, and waste related to stationary sources. We have obtained the necessary permits from the state of Colorado, which implements the delegated Federal programs. These programs regulate the emissions, discharges, and waste generated in the production of our products.  Like the Federal standards for our products, we continue to monitor the standards and take measures to comply with them.
 Our advertising is subject to regulation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and related regulations, which prohibit false and misleading claims in advertising. We believe that all of our labeling and promotional materials comply with these regulations.
