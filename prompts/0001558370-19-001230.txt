     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     Business Overview
     Primoris Services Corporation (“Primoris”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a holding company of various subsidiaries which form one of the larger publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the United States. Serving diverse end-markets, we provide a wide range of construction, fabrication, maintenance, replacement, and engineering services to major public and private utilities, petrochemical companies, energy companies, municipalities, state departments of transportation and other customers. We install, replace, repair and rehabilitate natural gas, refined product, water and wastewater pipeline systems; large diameter gas and liquid pipeline facilities; electric utility systems; and heavy civil projects, earthwork and site development. We also construct mechanical facilities and other structures, including power plants, petrochemical facilities, refineries, water and wastewater treatment facilities and parking structures. Finally, we provide specialized process and product engineering services.
     We have longstanding relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length from several days to as long as 60 months, or longer for completion of larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer, in any year a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenue.
     Founded as ARB, Inc. (“ARB”) in 1960, we became organized as Primoris in Nevada in 2003, and we became a Delaware public company in July 2008 when we merged with a special purpose acquisition company (a non-operating shell company). Since that time, we have grown organically and through strategic acquisitions, which has allowed us to expand our service capabilities and geographic footprint.
     Acquisitions
     Willbros Group, Inc. (“Willbros”). As more fully described in Note 4 — “Business Combinations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on June 1, 2018, we acquired Willbros for approximately $110.6 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. The total purchase price was funded through a combination of existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Willbros is a specialty energy infrastructure contractor serving the oil and gas and power industries through its utility transmission and distribution, oil and gas, and Canadian operations, which principally executes industrial and power projects. Willbros expands our services into electric utility-focused offerings and increases our geographic presence in the United States and Canada.
     Other acquisitions. In addition to the Willbros acquisition, we have entered into agreements to purchase smaller businesses or business assets to start a business as we continue to seek opportunities to expand our skill sets or operating locations.  During 2014 we acquired Vadnais Trenchless Services, Inc., and in 2015, we acquired Aevenia, Inc.  In 2016, we further enhanced our market reach with the purchase of Mueller Concrete Construction Company and Northern Energy & Power.  During 2017, we acquired Florida Gas Contractors and Coastal Field Services. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates, especially those with strong management teams with good reputations.  
     Reportable Segments
     Our reportable segments consist of the Power, Industrial, and Engineering (“Power”) segment, the Pipeline and Underground (“Pipeline”) segment, the Utilities and Distribution (“Utilities”) segment, the Transmission and Distribution (“Transmission”) segment, which is a new reportable segment created in 2018 in connection with the acquisition of Willbros, and the Civil segment.
    
 
  4

 

 Each of our reportable segments is comprised of similar business units that specialize in services unique to the segment. Driving the end-user focused segments are differences in the economic characteristics of each segment; the nature of the services provided by each segment; the production processes of each segment; the type or class of customer using the segment’s services; the methods used by the segment to provide the services; and the regulatory environment of each segment’s customers.
     The classification of revenue and gross profit for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Our segments may perform services across industries or perform joint services for customers in multiple industries. To determine reportable segment gross profit, certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, equipment costs and indirect operating expenses, were made.
     The following is a brief description of the reportable segments:
     The Power segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada and specializes in a range of services that include full Engineering, Procurement, and Construction project delivery, turnkey construction, retrofits, upgrades, repairs, outages, and maintenance for entities in the petroleum, petrochemical, water, and other industries.
     The Pipeline segment operates throughout the United States and specializes in a range of services, including pipeline construction, pipeline maintenance, pipeline facility work, compressor stations, pump stations, metering facilities, and other pipeline related services for entities in the petroleum and petrochemical industries.
     The Utilities segment operates primarily in California and the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States and specializes in a range of services, including utility line installation and maintenance, gas and electric distribution, streetlight construction, substation work, and fiber optic cable installation.
     The Transmission segment operates primarily in the Southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and specializes in a range of services in electric and gas transmission and distribution, including comprehensive engineering, procurement, maintenance and construction, repair, and restoration of utility infrastructure
     The Civil segment operates primarily in the Southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and specializes in highway and bridge construction, airport runway and taxiway construction, demolition, heavy earthwork, soil stabilization, mass excavation, and drainage projects.
     Strategy
     Our strategy has remained consistent from year to year and continues to emphasize the following key elements:
    
· | Diversification Through Controlled Expansion. We continue to emphasize the expansion of our scope of services beyond our current focus by increasing the scope of services offered to current customers and by adding new customers. We will evaluate acquisitions that offer growth opportunities and the ability to leverage our resources as a leading service provider to the energy, power, refining and water industries. Our strategy also considers selective expansion to new geographic regions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Emphasis on Retention of Existing Customers and Recurring Revenue. In order to fully leverage our relationships with our existing customer base, we believe it is important to maintain strong customer relationships and to expand our base of recurring revenue sources and recurring customers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ownership of Equipment. Many of our services are equipment intensive. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our ownership of a large and varied construction fleet and our maintenance facilities enhances our access to reliable equipment at a favorable cost. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stable Work Force. Our business model emphasizes self-performance of a significant portion of our work. In each of our segments, we maintain a stable work force of skilled, experienced laborers, many of whom 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  5

 

are cross-trained in projects such as pipeline and facility construction, refinery maintenance, and piping systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Selective Bidding. We selectively bid on projects that we believe offer an opportunity to meet our profitability objectives or that offer the opportunity to enter promising new markets. In addition, we review our bidding opportunities to attempt to minimize concentration of work with any one customer, in any one industry, or in stressed labor markets. We believe that by carefully positioning ourselves in market segments that have meaningful barriers of entry, we can position ourselves so that we compete with other strong, experienced bidders. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain a conservative capital structure and strong balance sheet. We have maintained a capital structure that provides access to debt financing as needed while relying on tangible net worth to provide the primary support for our operations. We believe this structure provides our customers, our lenders, and our bonding companies assurance of our financial capabilities. We maintain a revolving credit facility to provide letter of credit capability and if needed, augment our liquidity needs.

      Backlog
     Backlog is discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.     Customers
     We have longstanding customer relationships with major utility, refining, petrochemical, power and engineering companies. We have completed major underground and industrial projects for a number of large natural gas transmission and petrochemical companies in the western United States, as well as significant projects for our engineering customers.  Through various acquisitions, we expanded our customer base to include a significant presence in the Gulf Coast and upper Midwest regions of the United States. Over time, the various acquisitions have also changed the composition of our customer base with significant increases in state agency projects. We enter into a large number of contracts each year and the projects can vary in length from several days to as long as 60 months, or longer for completion on larger projects. Although we have not been dependent upon any one customer in any year, a small number of customers tend to constitute a substantial portion of our total revenue in any given year.
     Our customers have included the Texas Department of Transportation and Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development in the Southern United States as well as many of the leading energy and utility companies in the United States, including, among others, Enterprise Pipeline, Xcel Energy, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Gas, Oncor Electric, Duke Energy, Sempra Energy, Williams, NRG, Chevron, Calpine, Kinder Morgan, Dominion, and Sasol. 
     The following customers accounted for more than 5.0% of our revenue in the periods indicated:
    
Description of customer’s business | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Public gas and electric utility | 8.5% | 8.9% | 9.2% 
Private gas and electric utility | 7.9% | 8.0% | 10.1%
State DOT | 6.9% | 9.3% | 9.7% 
Pipeline operator | 6.7% | * | * 
Pipeline operator | 5.3% | * | * 
Chemical/Energy producer | * | 6.8% | 10.4%
Pipeline operator | * | 5.4% | * 
Pipeline operator | * | * | 6.2% 
Totals | 35.3% | 38.4% | 45.6%


 (*)Indicates a customer with less than 5.0% of revenue during such period.
    
 
  6

 

 As can be seen from the table, the customers accounting for revenue in excess of 5.0% each year varies from year to year due to the nature of our business.  A large construction project for a customer may result in significant revenue in that one year, with significantly less revenue in subsequent years after project completion.
     For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, 52.2%, 56.4% and 60.4%, respectively, of total revenue was generated from our top ten customers in each year.  In each of the years, a different group of customers comprised the top ten customers by revenue.
     Management at each of our business units is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our business unit management teams develop existing customer relationships to secure additional projects and increase revenue from our current customer base.  Business unit managers are also responsible for pursuing growth opportunities with prospective new customers.
     We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. Some of our strategic relationships are in the form of strategic alliance or long-term maintenance agreements.  However, we realize that future opportunities also require cost effective bids, as pricing is a key element for most construction projects.
     Ongoing Projects
     The following is a summary of ongoing construction projects demonstrating our capabilities in different markets at December 31, 2018:

 | | | | | | | | Remaining | 
 | | | Approximate | | Estimated | | Backlog at | 
 | | | Contract | | Completion | | December 31, | 
Segment | Project | Location | Amount | | Date | | 2018 | 
 | | | (Millions) | | | | (Millions) | 
Pipeline | 177 Mile Natural Gas Pipeline | Mid-Atlantic | $ | 774 | | 12/2020 | | $ | 573
Civil | U.S. 59 Highway | Liberty County, TX | $ | 102 | | 06/2022 | | $ | 101
Power | LNG Plant Replacement | Hopkinton, MA | $ | 123 | | 05/2020 | | $ | 70 
Pipeline | Dual force main & generator replacement | Marina Del Rey, CA | $ | 84 | | 06/2020 | | $ | 30 

      Seasonality, cyclicality and variability
     Our results of operations are subject to quarterly variations. Some of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice and snow, which can impact our ability to perform construction services. While the majority of our work is in the southern half of the United States, these seasonal impacts can affect revenue and profitability in all of our businesses since utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand. Any quarter can be affected either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of the country.  In addition, demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the calendar year due to clients’ internal budget cycles.  As a result, we usually experience higher revenue and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters.
     We are also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal, but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions.  Our business may be affected by declines or delays in new projects or by client project schedules.  Because of the cyclical nature of our business, the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods, and our financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter.  Results from one quarter may not be indicative of financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year.
     Competition
     We face substantial competition on large construction projects from both regional and national contractors, including competition from larger companies that have financial and other resources in excess of those available to us. Competitors on small construction projects range from a few large construction companies to a variety of smaller contractors. We compete with many local and regional firms for construction services and with a number of large firms on select projects. Each business unit faces varied competition depending on the types of projects and services offered.

 We compete with different companies in different end markets.  For example, competitors in our underground markets include Quanta Services, Inc. and MasTec, Inc.; competitors in our industrial markets include Kiewit Corporation; and competitors in our highway services markets include Sterling Construction Company, and privately-held Boh Brothers and Zachary Construction Company. In each market we may also compete with local, private companies.
     We believe that the primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation for quality, delivery and safety, relevant experience, availability of skilled labor, machinery and equipment, financial strength, knowledge of local markets and conditions, and estimating abilities. We believe that we have the ability to compete favorably in all of these factors. 
     Contract Provisions and Subcontracting
     We typically structure contracts as unit-price, time and material, fixed-price or cost reimbursable plus fixed fee.  A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts that are fixed-price or unit-price contracts. Under a fixed-price contract, we provide labor, equipment and services required by a project for a competitively bid or negotiated fixed price. Under a unit-price contract, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices.  While the unit-price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer, any increase in our unit cost over the unit price bid, whether due to inflation, inefficiency, faulty estimates or other factors, is borne by us. Significant materials required under a fixed-price or unit-price contract, such as pipe, turbines, boilers and vessels, are usually supplied by the customer.
     Our gas and electric distribution services are typically provided pursuant to renewable contracts on a “unit-cost” basis. Fees on unit-cost contracts are negotiated and are earned based on units completed. Historically, substantially all of the gas and electric distribution customers have renewed their maintenance contracts. Facilities maintenance services, such as regularly scheduled and emergency repair work, are provided on an ongoing basis at predetermined rates.
     Construction contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding or through negotiations with long-standing customers. We are typically invited to bid on projects undertaken by recurring customers who maintain pre-qualified contractor lists. Contractors are selected for the pre-approved contractor lists by virtue of their prior performance for such customers, as well as their experience, reputation for quality, safety record, financial strength and bonding capacity.
     In evaluating bid opportunities, we consider such factors as the customer, the geographic location of the work, the availability of labor, our competitive advantage or disadvantage relative to other likely contractors, our current and projected workload, the likelihood of additional work, and the project’s cost and profitability estimates. We use computer-based estimating systems and our estimating staff has significant experience in the construction industry. The project estimates form the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project cost system, thereby enabling management to monitor a project. Project costs are accumulated and monitored regularly against billings and payments to assure proper tracking of cash flow on the project.
     Most contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner. In addition, many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with damages or liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met. To date, these provisions have not materially adversely affected us.
     We act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, we are potentially subject to increased costs and reputational risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated. While we subcontract specialized activities such as blasting, hazardous waste removal and selected electrical work, we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources, including labor and equipment.

 Risk Management, Insurance and Bonding
     We maintain general liability and excess liability insurance covering our construction equipment, and workers’ compensation insurance in amounts consistent with industry practices. In certain states, we self-insure our workers’ compensation claims up to $250,000 per occurrence, and we maintain insurance covering larger claims. In addition, we maintain umbrella coverage policies.  We believe that our insurance programs are adequate.
     We maintain a diligent safety and risk management program that has resulted in a favorable loss experience factor. Through our safety director and the employment of a large staff of regional and site specific safety managers, we have been able to effectively assess and control potential losses and liabilities in both the pre-construction and performance phases of our projects. Though we strongly focus on safety in the workplace, we cannot give assurances that we can prevent or reduce all injuries or claims in our workplace.
     In connection with our business, we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds guaranteeing our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, working capital, backlog, past performance, management expertise and other factors and the surety company’s current underwriting standards.  To date, we have obtained the level of surety bonds necessary to support our business.
     Regulation
     Our operations are subject to compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state, municipal agencies and authorities, and international laws and regulations including:
    
· | Licensing, permitting and inspection requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Regulations relating to worker safety, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Contractor licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------


· | Regulations concerning labor relations and affirmative action; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Regulations regarding the protection of the environment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

      While compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not adversely affected operations in the past, it has caused customers to delay projects, and there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance with such requirements will not adversely affect operations. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
     Environmental Matters and Climate Change Impacts
     We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil. We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes diesel fuel. Any changes in laws requiring us to use equipment that runs on alternative fuels could require a significant investment, which could adversely impact our financial performance.
     We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under some of these laws and regulations, liability can be imposed for cleanup of previously owned or leased properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former operations at our facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing.
    
 
  9

 

 In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to a revocation of our licenses or permits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our contracts with our customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services.  From time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to certain of our properties. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with our environmental obligations to date and that any such obligations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
     The potential physical impact of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in Item 1A. “Risk Factors”, our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, major changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our revenue and gross margins.
     Climate change could also affect our customers and the types of projects that they award.  Demand for power projects, underground pipelines or highway projects could be affected by significant changes in weather or climate conditions or by regulatory changes relating to climate change.  Reductions in project awards could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.
     Employees
     We believe that our employees are the most valuable resource in successfully completing construction work. Our ability to maintain sufficient continuous work for approximately 9,000 hourly employees helps us to instill in our employees loyalty to and an understanding of our policies and contributes to our strong production, safety and quality record.
     As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,600 salaried employees and 9,000 hourly employees.  The total number of hourly personnel employed is subject to the volume of construction work in progress.
     Several of our subsidiaries have operations that are unionized through the negotiation and execution of collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have varying terms and are subject to renegotiation upon expiration. We have not experienced recent work stoppages and believe our employee and union relations are good.
