Item 1. Business.
General Development of Business
Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies that are engaged in the media and entertainment industries primarily in North America and the U.K. Our principal businesses and assets include our consolidated subsidiaries Sirius XM Holdings, Formula 1, Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves Holdings”) and our equity affiliate Live Nation. 
During November 2015, Liberty’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) authorized management to pursue a reclassification of the Company’s common stock into three new tracking stock groups, one to be designated as the Liberty Braves tracking stock, one to be designated as the Liberty Media tracking stock and one to be designated as the Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock (the “Recapitalization”), and to cause to be distributed subscription rights related to the Liberty Braves tracking stock following the creation of the new tracking stocks. The Recapitalization was completed on April 15, 2016.
The Liberty Media common stock was renamed the Liberty Formula One common stock in January 2017.
A tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or “track” the economic performance of a particular business or “group,” rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the “Braves Group”) and Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group’s stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as Sirius XM Holdings or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Holders of a tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of a tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.
On April 22, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the immediate reattribution of certain assets and liabilities between the Formula One Group and the Liberty SiriusXM Group (collectively, the “reattribution”). The reattribution is reflected in the Company’s financial statements on a prospective basis.
The Liberty SiriusXM common stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group, which, as of December 31, 2022, include Liberty’s interests in Sirius XM Holdings and Live Nation, corporate cash, Liberty’s 1.375% Cash Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty’s 2.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048, Liberty’s 2.75% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2049, Liberty’s 0.5% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050 and margin loan obligations incurred by wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries of Liberty. In April 2021, the Liberty SiriusXM Group paid approximately $384 million to the Formula One Group to settle the call spread with respect to the shares of Live Nation attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Sirius XM Holdings is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event Sirius XM Holdings were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty’s management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and take appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty’s management and the Board of Directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty’s tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty’s tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether. The Liberty SiriusXM Group retains intergroup interests in the Braves Group and the Formula One Group as of December 31, 2022, as described below.

The Liberty Braves common stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Braves Group, which, as of December 31, 2022, include its subsidiary, Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”) and certain assets and liabilities associated with the Braves’ stadium (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”) and a mixed-use development around Truist Park that features retail office, hotel and entertainment opportunities (the “Mixed-Use Development”) and cash. The Liberty SiriusXM Group and the Formula One Group retain intergroup interests in the Braves Group as of December 31, 2022, as described below.
The Liberty Formula One common stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Formula One Group, which, as of December 31, 2022, include all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Braves Group or the Liberty SiriusXM Group, including Liberty’s interest in Formula 1, cash, an intergroup interest in the Braves Group, Liberty’s 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and Liberty’s 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027. 
The number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Formula One Group is 6,792,903, representing an 11.0% intergroup interest at December 31, 2022. The number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group is 1,811,066, representing a 2.9% intergroup interest at December 31, 2022. The number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest in the Formula One Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group is 4,165,288, representing a 1.7% intergroup interest at December 31, 2022. The intergroup interests will remain outstanding until the redemption of the outstanding interests, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, through a transfer of securities, cash and/or other assets from the Braves Group or Formula One Group to the respective tracking stock group.
During November 2022, the Board of Directors authorized management of the Company to pursue a plan to redeem each outstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of a newly formed entity, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (the “Split-Off”). Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (“ABH”) will be comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Braves Group. The intergroup interests in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and Formula One Group remaining immediately prior to the Split-Off, however, will be settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off. 
Following the Split-Off, the Company intends to reclassify its then-outstanding shares of common stock into three new tracking stocks to be designated Liberty SiriusXM common stock, Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock, and, in connection therewith, provide for the attribution of the businesses, assets and liabilities of the Company’s remaining tracking stock groups among its newly created Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group and Liberty Live Group (the “Reclassification”). 
The Split-Off and the Reclassification will be subject to various conditions. Both transactions will be conditioned on, among other things, certain requisite approvals of the holders of the Company’s common stock and the receipt of opinions of tax counsel. In addition, the Split-Off will be conditioned on the requisite approval of Major League Baseball and the receipt of an IRS ruling. Additionally, the Reclassification is dependent and conditioned on the approval and completion of the Split-Off, and will not be implemented unless the Split-Off is completed; however, the Split-Off is not dependent upon the approval of the Reclassification and may be implemented even if the Reclassification is not approved. Each of the Split-Off and the Reclassification is intended to be tax-free to stockholders of the Company. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions, the Company expects to complete the Split-Off and the Reclassification in the first half of 2023.
As a result of COVID-19, the start of the 2020 Formula 1 race calendar, comprised of 17 Events, and the Major League Baseball season, comprised of 60 regular season games, were delayed until the beginning of July 2020 and end of July 2020, respectively. In addition, in mid-March 2020, Live Nation suspended all large-scale live entertainment events due to COVID-19. In 2021, the timing of baseball season and the number of regular season games played returned to normal, and limitations on fan attendance were lifted in May. Formula 1 held a record 22 Events in 2021. Restrictions on fan attendance at Formula 1 Events reduced as 2021 progressed. Starting in the third quarter of 2021, Live Nation had a meaningful restart of its operations with growth in ticket sales, new sponsor partners and the resumption of shows, primarily in the U.S. and U.K. In 2022, the Braves played a full regular season schedule and Formula 1 held 22 Events.

On January 26, 2021, Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (“LMAC”) consummated its initial public offering of 57.5 million units, generating gross proceeds to LMAC of $575 million, which were placed in a U.S.-based trust account.

On November 14, 2022, stockholders of LMAC approved an amendment to LMAC’s certificate of incorporation which allowed LMAC to unwind and redeem all of its outstanding public shares prior to December 30, 2022. The redemption was completed during December 2022 and LMAC was subsequently dissolved.

Sirius XM Holdings continues to expand the range of choices for its listeners – both in terms of compelling content and the array of ways in which it can be consumed. There are approximately 152 million vehicles in operation with Sirius XM radios, and the proliferation of smart speakers and other connected devices has increased the range of options consumers have for engaging with and consuming Sirius XM Holdings’ content. 
Sirius XM Holdings is also focused on rapidly growing content categories, such as its continued interest in podcasting. In 2022, an estimated 109 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly.
Sirius XM
Sirius XM features music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels and other content, as well as podcasts and infotainment services, in the U.S. on a subscription basis. Sirius XM’s premier content bundles include live, curated and certain exclusive and on demand programming. The Sirius XM service is distributed through its two proprietary satellite radio systems and streamed via the SXM App for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. Satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers, retailers and its website. The Sirius XM service is also available through a user interface, called “360L,” that combines Sirius XM’s satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience. 
Sirius XM’s primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of its customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. Sirius XM also derives revenue from advertising on select non-music channels, direct sales of Sirius XM’s satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services. As of December 31, 2022, Sirius XM had approximately 34.3 million subscribers.

The Sirius XM Business
Programming. Sirius XM offers a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, and news, including:

Sirius XM believes that its broad and diverse programming, including its lineup of exclusive content, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers. Sirius XM makes changes to its programming lineup from time to time as it strives to attract new subscribers and offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to existing subscribers. The channel lineups for its services are available at siriusxm.com.

Sirius XM has agreements with many automakers to deploy its 360L interface in a variety of vehicles. In 2022, the 360L platform was included in approximately 110 vehicles models manufactured for sale in the U.S. Sirius XM expects that 360L will be included in a majority of vehicles that include Sirius XM functionality in the future. 360L allows Sirius XM to take advantage of advanced in-dash infotainment systems. 360L is intended to leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage and low delivery costs of Sirius XM’s satellite infrastructure with the two-way communication capability of a wireless streaming service to provide consumers seamless access to Sirius XM’s content, including Sirius XM’s live channels, on demand service, podcasts and even more personalized music services. The wireless streaming connection included in 360L enables enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of Sirius XM’s content in the vehicle easier. 360L also provides Sirius XM data on how subscribers use Sirius XM’s service.
Distribution of Radios
New Vehicles. Sirius XM distributes satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles. Sirius XM has agreements with major automakers to offer satellite radios in their vehicles. Satellite radios are available as a factory -installed feature in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the U.S. Most automakers include a subscription to Sirius XM’s service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles. In certain cases, Sirius XM receives subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of its service. Sirius XM shares with certain automakers a portion of the revenue it derives from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive its service. Sirius XM also reimburses various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses.
Previously Owned Vehicles. Sirius XM also acquires subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios. Sirius XM has entered into agreements with many automakers to include a subscription to Sirius XM’s service in the sale or lease of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs. Sirius XM also works directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified used vehicles. Sirius XM has developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned 

I-7



vehicles which include satellite radios and has established marketing plans to promote its services to these potential subscribers.
Retail. Sirius XM sells satellite radios directly to consumers through its website. Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national, regional and online retailers, such as Amazon.com.
Sirius XM’s Satellite Radio Systems
Sirius XM’s satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas of the continental U.S. despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions. Sirius XM continually monitors its infrastructure and regularly evaluates improvements in technology.
Sirius XM’s satellite radio systems have three principal components: satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities; studios; and radios.
Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities
Satellites. Sirius XM provides its service through a fleet of orbiting geostationary satellites. Two of these satellites, FM-5 and FM-6, transmit Sirius XM’s service on frequencies originally licensed by the FCC to Sirius, and two of these satellites, XM-5 and SXM-8, transmit its service on frequencies originally licensed by the FCC to XM. The XM-3 and XM-4 satellites serve as spares for the XM system.
On December 13, 2020, the SXM-7 satellite was successfully launched and in-orbit testing began on January 4, 2021. During in-orbit testing of SXM-7, events occurred which caused failures of certain SXM-7 payload units. The evaluation of SXM-7 concluded that the satellite would not function as intended. SXM-7 remains in-orbit at its assigned orbital location, but is not being used to provide satellite radio service. 
Sirius XM has entered into agreements for the design and construction of four additional satellites, SXM-9, SXM-10, SXM-11 and SXM-12. Sirius XM has also entered into agreements to launch two of those satellites. Construction of the SXM-9 and SXM-10 satellites is underway and those satellites are expected to be launched into geostationary orbits in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Construction of the SXM-11 and SXM-12 satellites is expected to begin shortly and those satellites are anticipated to be launched into geostationary orbits in 2026 and 2027, respectively.
Satellite Insurance. Sirius XM has procured insurance for SXM-9, SXM-10, SXM-11 and SXM-12 to cover the risks associated with each satellite’s launch and first year of in-orbit operation. Sirius XM does not have insurance policies covering its other in-orbit satellites, as Sirius XM considers the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure.
Terrestrial Repeaters. In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from Sirius XM’s satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected. In other areas with a high density of next generation wireless systems, Sirius XM’s service may experience interference. In many of these areas, Sirius XM has deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement and enhance its signal coverage and, in other areas, Sirius XM may deploy additional repeaters to mitigate interference. Sirius XM operates over 1,000 terrestrial repeaters across the U.S. as part of its systems.
Other Satellite Facilities. Sirius XM controls and communicates with its satellites from facilities in North America. Its satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator.
Studios
Sirius XM’s programming originates from studios in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington, D.C., and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Nashville and a variety of venues across the country. Sirius XM Holdings’ corporate headquarters is in New York City. Sirius XM provides equipment to artists and hosts to enable remote creation and transmission of programming.

I-8



Radios
Sirius XM does not manufacture radios. Sirius XM has authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and has licensed its technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands. Sirius XM manages various aspects of the production of satellite radios. To facilitate the sale of radios, Sirius XM may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers.
Connected Vehicle Services
Sirius XM provides connected vehicle services to several automakers. Sirius XM’s connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers. Sirius XM offers a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicle diagnostics and stolen or parked vehicle locator services. Subscribers to Sirius XM’s connected vehicle services are not included in its subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.
Other Services
Commercial Accounts. Sirius XM’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cloud Cover Media, Inc. (“Cloud Cover”), offers a music programming service for commercial establishments. Commercial subscription accounts are also available through Pandora for Business and SiriusXM for Business, each of which offers a licensed, commercial-free music service for offices, restaurants and other business establishments.
Satellite Television Service. Certain of Sirius XM’s music channels are offered as part of select programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service. 
Travel Link. Sirius XM offers Travel Link, a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores, and movie listings.

Sirius XM Canada
Sirius XM holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada, with the remainder of Sirius XM Canada’s voting and equity interests held by two shareholders.
In 2022, Sirius XM and Sirius XM Canada entered into an amended and restated services and distribution agreement which modified the existing Services Agreement and terminated the existing Advisory Agreement between Sirius XM and Sirius XM Canada. Pursuant to the amended and restated services and distribution agreement, the fee payable by Sirius XM Canada to Sirius XM was modified from a fixed percentage of revenue to a variable fee, based on a target operating profit for Sirius XM Canada. Such variable fee is expected to be evaluated annually based on comparable companies. In accordance with the amended and restated services and distribution agreement, the fee is payable on a monthly basis, in arrears, beginning January 1, 2022.

I-9



In May 2017, Sirius XM extended a loan to Sirius XM Canada in the principal amount of $131 million. In connection with the execution of the amended and restated services and distribution agreement, Sirius XM forgave $113 million in principal amount of such loan to Sirius XM Canada, leaving an outstanding principal amount of $8 million on such loan. The principal amount that was forgiven by Sirius XM was considered satisfied and as contributed capital from Sirius XM.

Copyrights to Programming
In connection with its businesses, Sirius XM Holdings must enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders: holders of musical compositions copyrights (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of sound recordings copyrights (that is, the actual recording of a work). Sirius XM and Pandora use both statutory and direct music licenses as part of their businesses. Sirius XM Holdings licenses varying rights - such as performance and mechanical rights - for use in its Sirius XM and Pandora businesses based on the various radio and interactive services they offer. Set forth below is a brief overview of the music composition and sound recording licenses employed by Sirius XM and Pandora. These music licensing arrangements are complex and the description below is only a summary of these complicated licensing schemes.
Musical Compositions: Performance Rights and Mechanical Rights
The holders of performance rights in musical compositions, generally songwriters and music publishers, are represented by performing rights organizations such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”) and Global Music Rights LLC (“GMR”). These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders.
The holders of the mechanical rights in musical compositions, generally songwriters and music publishers, have traditionally licensed these rights through the statutory license set forth in Section 115 of the U.S. Copyright Act (the “Copyright Act”); however, mechanical rights can also be licensed directly.
The changing market for musical compositions may have an adverse effect on the Sirius XM and Pandora businesses, including increasing costs and limiting the musical works available to them.
Sirius XM has arrangements with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC and GMR to license the musical compositions it performs on its satellite radio and streaming services. Sirius XM does not require a mechanical license.
Pandora has arrangements with ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, GMR and a variety of other copyright owners to license the musical compositions performance rights used on Pandora’s services.
For the Pandora ad-supported radio service, certain copyright holders receive, as a performance royalty, their usage-based and ownership-based share of a royalty pool equal to 21.5% of the content acquisition costs that Pandora pays for sound recordings on its ad-supported service and others receive a fixed fee.
Pandora must also license “reproduction rights” or “mechanical rights” to offer the interactive features of the Pandora services. For the Pandora subscription services, copyright holders receive payments for these rights at the rates determined in accordance with the statutory license set forth in Section 115 of the Copyright Act. In January 2018, the Copyright Royalty Board (the “CRB”) set a rate structure for the five-year period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2022 (“Phono III”). The rate was the greater of 15.1% of revenue or 26.2% of record label payments in 2022, with each rate prong increasing from slightly lower percentages in years prior to 2022.
In July 2022, after the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the CRB’s initial rate determination, the CRB issued a new ruling that retained the first prong from its initial determination (with rates increasing up to 15.1% of revenue in 2022), but revised the second rate prong downward, from 26.2% to 21% of record label payments for each year from 2018-2022. Music publishers have challenged that downward adjustment, and a decision from the CRB on that challenge is expected to be issued in 2023. Following that decision, Pandora will make retroactive adjustments to its 2018-2022 payments to the extent that the new, final rates differ from those under which its previous payments were made.

I-12



In September 2022, in a CRB proceeding to determine mechanical royalty rates under Section 115 for the five-year period commencing January 1, 2023 and ending December 31, 2027 (“Phono IV”), the participating music publishers and digital music services, including Pandora, reached a settlement. That settlement set the rates at the greater of 15.1% of revenue or 26.2% of record label payments for 2023, rising over the five-year period to 15.35% of revenue or 26.2% of record label payments by 2027. That settlement was adopted by the CRB on December 30, 2022, as became effective on January 1, 2023. 
Sound Recordings
Operators of a non-interactive satellite radio or streaming service are entitled to license sound recordings under the statutory license contained in Section 114 of the Copyright Act (the “statutory license”). Under the statutory license, Sirius XM Holdings may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings or, if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the CRB. Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, Inc. (“SoundExchange”), an organization which negotiates licenses and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists.
Interactive streaming services, such as Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium, do not qualify for the statutory license and those services must negotiate direct license arrangements with the owners of copyrights in sound recordings.
Sirius XM Business. For the ten-year period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2027, the CRB set the royalty rate payable by Sirius XM under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings over Sirius XM’s satellite radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, to be 15.5% of gross revenue, subject to exclusions and adjustments. The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from Sirius XM’s U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers, and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings. The rates and terms permit Sirius XM to reduce the payment due each month for those sound recordings directly licensed from copyright owners and exclude from revenue certain other items, such as royalties paid to Sirius XM for intellectual property, sales and use taxes, bad debt expense and generally revenue attributable to areas of Sirius XM’s business that do not involve the use of copyrighted sound recordings.
In 2022, Sirius XM paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings of $0.0028 on its Sirius XM streaming service which increased from $0.0026 in 2021.  
Pandora Business. Pandora has entered into direct license agreements with major and independent music labels and distributors for a significant majority of the sound recordings that stream on the Pandora ad-supported service, Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium.
For sound recordings that Pandora streams and for which it has not entered into a direct license agreement with the sound recording rights holders, the sound recordings are streamed pursuant to the statutory license, and applicable rates thereunder, set by the CRB. Sound recordings subject to the statutory license can only be played through Pandora’s radio services and not through services that are offered on-demand or offline or through any replay features. The royalty rates under many of those direct licenses, which cover a large majority of the sound recordings that Sirius XM Holdings performs on Pandora, are indexed to the statutory rates established by the CRB.
Prior to the enactment of the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act in October 2018, Pandora’s rights to perform certain sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 were governed by state law. Pandora still faces a class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs who allege that Pandora violated their alleged exclusive copyright ownership rights to the reproduction of sound recordings created prior to February 15, 1972. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on this action.
Trademarks
Sirius XM has registered, and intends to maintain, the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” and “SXM” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services it offers. Sirius XM is not aware of any material 

I-13



claims of infringement or other challenges to its right to use the “Sirius”, “XM”, “SiriusXM” or “SXM” trademarks in the U.S. Sirius XM also has registered, and intends to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of its channels. Sirius XM has also registered the trademarks “Sirius”, “XM” and “SiriusXM” in Canada. Sirius XM has granted a license to use certain of its trademarks in Canada to Sirius XM Canada.
Pandora has registered, and intends to maintain, the trademarks “Pandora,” “Ampcast” and “Music Genome Project,” in addition to a number of other Pandora logos and marks, with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services it offers. Pandora also has registered the trademark “Pandora” in Australia, Canada, Chile, the European Union, India, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan and other countries, and the trademark “Music Genome Project” in Australia, Canada, China and New Zealand.
Formula 1 
Formula 1 holds the exclusive commercial rights with respect to the FIA Formula One World Championship (the “World Championship”), an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams (the “Teams”) compete for the Constructors’ Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers’ Championship. The World Championship, which has been held every year since 1950 and takes place on high profile iconic circuits, is a global series with a varying number of events (“Events”) taking place in different countries around the world each season. The 2022 World Championship calendar was originally scheduled to have 23 Events. However, following the cancellation of the Russian Grand Prix, 22 Events took place in 20 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and North and South America. The 2021 World Championship calendar was originally scheduled to have 23 Events. However, after a number of Events were cancelled and/or replaced due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 22 Events took place in 20 countries across Europe, the Middle East and North and South America. The 2020 World Championship calendar was originally scheduled to have 22 Events. However, the start of the season was postponed until early July, with certain Events being cancelled, certain new Events being added and others rescheduled at later dates, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised 2020 World Championship calendar was comprised of 17 Events in 12 countries across Europe and the Middle East. 
In 2022, the World Championship was followed by hundreds of millions of television viewers in approximately 200 territories and a number of Formula 1’s Events had record attendance, with crowd and hospitality numbers well above pre-COVID-19 levels. Restrictions on fan attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic reduced as 2021 progressed, with all Events in the second half of the year operating at either full capacity or with fewer restrictions than had been applied at Events in the first half of the year. Fans were prohibited from attending all but three Events during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant limitations on fan attendance at these Events.
Formula 1 is responsible for the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship, in the course of which it coordinates and transacts with the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (“FIA”), the governing body and regulator of world motor sport, the Teams, the race promoters that stage Events, various media organizations worldwide, as well as advertisers and sponsors. Formula 1 also performs activities related to critical components of the World Championship, including filming and providing technical support at Events, production of the international television feed and logistics related to the transport of its and the Teams’ equipment, ensuring high quality and reducing delivery risk around the World Championship. Additionally, Formula 1, pursuant to other agreements with the FIA, holds the exclusive right to promote and commercially exploit F2 and F3 through 2041.
Formula 1 also generates revenue from a variety of other sources, including the operation of the Formula 1 Paddock Club hospitality program (the “Paddock Club”), freight, logistical and travel related services for the Teams and other third parties, the F2 and F3 race series, which run principally as support races during Event weekends, various television production and post-production activities, digital and social media activities and revenue from other licensing of the commercial rights associated with the Formula 1 brand. 
Formula 1 recognizes the majority of its revenue and expenses in connection with Events that take place in different countries around the world, generally between March and December each year. As a result, the revenue and expenses recognized by Formula 1 are generally lower during the first quarter as compared to the rest of the quarters throughout the year. However, due to the delayed start of the 2020 Formula 1 race calendar, with the first Event not taking 

I-14



place until July 2020, the revenue and expenses recognized by Formula 1 were significantly lower during the first and second quarters of 2020 as compared to the third and fourth quarters. The seasonality of Formula 1’s revenue and expenses was more normal in 2022 and 2021.
Primary Revenue
Formula 1 derives its primary revenue from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of entering into race promotion, media rights and sponsorship arrangements. A significant majority of the race promotion, media rights and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts.
Race Promotion. Race promotion revenue comprised 28.6%, 30.6%, and 13.0% of Formula 1’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Formula 1 grants to race promoters the rights to host, stage and promote each Event pursuant to contracts that typically have an initial term of three to seven years. For established Events, the duration of subsequent renewals is more variable according to local market conditions. These contracts may allow for flat fees over the term, but more typically they include annual fee escalators over the life of the contract, which are typically based on annual movement in a selected consumer price index or fixed percentages of up to 5% per year. Race promotion revenue was significantly lower in 2020 as a result of the reduced calendar and one-time revised fee arrangements, as most Events were closed to fans, generating very different economics for the promoters.
Race promoters are generally circuit owners, local and national automobile clubs, special event organizers or governmental bodies. Race promoters generate revenue from ticket sales and sometimes from concessions, secondary hospitality offerings (other than the Paddock Club), local sponsorship opportunities and on-site activations. Tickets are sold by the promoters for the entire Event weekend or individual days.
Media Rights.  Media rights revenue comprised 36.4%, 40.3% and 58.5% of Formula 1’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The variation in the 2020 percentage is due to a number of factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the significant decrease in race promotion revenue, as described above. Certain fee relief arrangements were made with broadcasting partners due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in fewer Events within a shorter period of time than anticipated. Formula 1 licenses rights to broadcast Events on television and other media platforms in specified countries or regions and in specified languages. These may also include rights to broadcast the race, practice and qualifying sessions, interactive television/digital services, repeat broadcasts and highlights. Contracts with broadcasters, which we refer to as television rights agreements (“TRAs”), typically have a term of three to five years. While annual fees from broadcasters may stay constant, they often increase each year during the term of the TRA by varying amounts. Formula 1’s media rights revenue is primarily generated from: (a) free-to-air television broadcasts, which are received by the end user without charge (other than any television license fee), and non-premium cable, satellite and other broadcasts, which are received as part of a subscriber’s basic package (together, “free-to-air television”); (b) premium and pay-per-view cable and satellite broadcasts, where the subscriber pays a premium fee to receive programming on a package or per-event basis (“pay television”) and (c) subscription revenue from Formula 1’s own direct-to-consumer over-the-top broadcast product F1TV. In 2022, Formula 1 had 12 free-to-air television agreements, 16 pay television agreements and 30 agreements, including multi-territory agreements, covering both free-to-air and pay television. Formula 1’s key broadcasters include Sky (pay television) in the U.K., Sky Deutschland (pay television) in Germany, Sky Italia (pay television) in Italy, Movistar and DAZN (pay television) in Spain, ESPN (pay television) in Pan Latin America, Canal+ (pay television) in France, Bandeirantes (free-to-air and pay television) in Brazil, Viaplay (free-to-air and pay television) in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands and Viaplay (pay television) in Iceland, Estonia, Lithuania and Lativa, ESPN and ESPN Deportes (pay television) in the U.S., Fox Sports (pay television) in Pan Asia (until the end of September 2021, replaced by three free-to-air and pay television agreements and seven pay television agreements across the region) and MBC and SSC (free-to-air and pay television) in the Middle East and North Africa.
Sponsorship. Sponsorship revenue comprised 16.9%, 15.7% and 18.3% of Formula 1’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Formula 1 sells Event-based sponsorship in the form of trackside advertising and race title sponsorship packages. In addition, sponsors can acquire status as a Global Partner of Formula 1 and/or Official Supplier to Formula 1. These advertiser and sponsor contracts typically have a term of three to five years 

I-15



(but may on occasion be of longer duration). Payments often increase each year based on a fixed amount, a fixed percentage or in accordance with the U.S. or European consumer price index or another agreed metric. Sponsorship revenue was significantly lower in 2020 as a result of certain Events not taking place and revised fee arrangements, as rights under certain contracts could not be fully serviced due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other Revenue
The remainder of Formula 1’s revenue is typically generated from a variety of other sources including facilitating the shipment of cars and equipment to and from events outside of Europe, revenue from the sale of tickets to the Formula One Paddock Club at most Events, support races at Events, various television production activities and other ancillary operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of these operations were significantly reduced in 2020, and others could not be operated.
FIA and the Teams
Formula 1’s business is built on a number of key relationships—those with the FIA, the Teams and Formula 1’s principal commercial partners. See “—Key Commercial Agreements” below for more information about Formula 1’s relationships with the FIA and the Teams.
FIA
The FIA is the governing body for world motor sport and as such, is solely responsible for regulating the sporting, technical and safety aspects of the World Championship, including race circuits to be used by race promotors, through the FIA’s F1 Commission and World Motor Sport Council. The FIA regulates all international motor sports, with the World Championship being the most prominent. The FIA owns the World Championship and has granted Formula 1 the exclusive commercial rights to the World Championship until the end of 2110 under the 100-Year Agreements (described below). In addition, the FIA, through its World Motor Sport Council, approves the calendar for the World Championship each year based on the agreed race promotor contracts for the coming season. Under the 100-Year Agreements, Formula 1 is only permitted to enter into race promotion contracts that are substantially in the form agreed between Formula 1 and the FIA.
Teams
The Teams are the participants in the World Championship and its Events, competing for the annual Constructors’ Championship, and their drivers compete for the annual Drivers’ Championship. There were 10 Teams competing in the 2022 World Championship. To be eligible to compete, a Team is responsible for the design and manufacturing of certain key parts of its cars, including the chassis. Currently, the Teams are supplied race engines by one of Ferrari, Mercedes, Renault or Red Bull Powertrains, with Audi committing to become an engine supplier beginning in the 2026 season. Under the terms of the 2021 Concorde Agreement (described below), Teams are entitled to receive significant team payments from a Formula 1 prize fund (the “Prize Fund”) based primarily on their results in prior years’ Constructors’ Championships. Formula 1 has no direct or indirect ownership interest in any Team, nor does it have any contractual arrangements with the drivers, who are all employed or contracted directly by the Teams. Each Team is responsible for securing its own drivers and funding the costs of competing in the World Championship. They receive Prize Fund payments from Formula 1, as well as sponsorship and advertising revenue from their own partners. The 2021 Concorde Agreement between Formula 1, the FIA and the Teams define the terms of the Team’s participation in the World Championship (for further detail, see “—Key Commercial Agreements—Concorde Agreement” below.)
Drivers
One of the distinctive features of the World Championship is the celebrity and diversity of its drivers. Differences in nationalities, temperaments and racing styles form part of the attractive mosaic of Formula 1. The success of a local driver also impacts the television viewership and revenue generated from that country or region. High profile drivers from the U.K. (Hamilton), the Netherlands (Verstappen), Germany (Vettel) and Spain (Alonso) have helped grow and sustain the Formula 1 business in those countries. For this reason, Formula 1 encourages the development of drivers from other 

I-16



strategic markets. F2 and F3 provide the training ground and stepping stones to Formula 1 for these drivers. All drivers are employed or contracted by the Teams and have no contractual relationship with Formula 1.
Key Commercial Agreements
100-Year Agreements
Under the 100-Year Agreements entered into by Formula 1 and the FIA in 2001, Formula 1 was granted an exclusive license with respect to all of the commercial rights to the World Championship, including its trademarks. This license, which took effect on January 1, 2011 and expires on December 31, 2110, maintains Formula 1’s exclusive commercial rights to the World Championship which Formula 1 held under previous agreements with the FIA.
The 100-Year Agreements also provide that Formula 1 may appoint a representative to the FIA, subject to the FIA’s approval, and that person will be a member of the FIA’s F1 Commission and World Motor Sport Council. The FIA may terminate the 100-Year Agreements and Formula 1’s exclusive license upon a change of control of Formula 1, unless either the FIA previously approved the transaction or the transaction falls within one of a number of exceptions. Formula 1 obtained the FIA’s approval of its acquisition by Liberty in January 2017 under the 100-Year Agreements.
In addition, the FIA may terminate Formula 1’s license if (i) certain Delta Topco Limited (“Delta Topco”) subsidiaries party to the 100-Year Agreements become insolvent; (ii) Formula 1 fails to pay an amount due to the FIA and such non-payment is not cured within 30 days of FIA’s demand for payment; (iii) arbitrators declare that Formula 1 materially breached the 100-Year Agreements and Formula 1 has not paid to the FIA certain penalties to cure such breach; or (iv) Formula 1 changes or removes certain of the FIA’s rights without its prior consent.
Concorde Agreement
From 1981 until 2012, successive Concorde Agreements governed the relationship between Formula 1, the FIA and the Teams, including the regulation of the World Championship. After the then-current Concorde Agreement expired on December 31, 2012, Formula 1 entered into a separate binding bilateral agreement with each Team (the “Team Agreements”), securing the relevant Team’s commitment to continue participating in the World Championship until December 31, 2020. In addition, Formula 1 entered into the 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement with the FIA in 2013. The 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement, in addition to making certain modifications to the 100-Year Agreements for the period to end 2030, provides that the FIA agrees to provide certain sporting governance arrangements and regulatory safeguards for the benefit of the Teams, to enter into a new Concorde Agreement for a term of eight years (from 2013 to 2020) reflecting those sporting governance arrangements and regulatory safeguards and to enter into a subsequent Concorde Agreement from 2021 to 2030 or to extend the sporting governance arrangements or regulatory safeguards agreed under the 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement on substantially the same terms from 2021 to 2030. The Team Agreements and the 2013 Concorde Implementation Agreement together provided, until December 31, 2020, the contractual framework for the World Championship that was previously set out in the Concorde Agreements.
In August 2020, Formula 1, the FIA and the Teams entered into the 2021 Concorde Agreement, securing the commitment of the Teams to continue participating in the World Championship from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2025, and governing the relationship between the parties during that period. The 2021 Concorde Agreement is made up of two separate documents: (a) the 2021 Concorde Commercial Agreement between Formula 1 and each of the Teams; and (b) the 2021 Concorde Governance Agreement between Formula 1, the FIA and each of the Teams.
The 2021 Concorde Agreement provides, among other things, for the participation of the Teams in the World Championship during the term of that agreement, and provides for Formula 1 to make certain Prize Fund payments to the Teams based on their performance in the Constructors’ Championship and other principles (such as success and heritage in Formula 1).

I-17



Key Provisions
As discussed above, the 2021 Concorde Agreement establishes a Prize Fund, establishes procedures for setting the World Championship calendar, and provides for certain termination rights. The 2021 Concorde Agreement establishes rules for the determination of the Prize Fund to be paid to the Teams, which is calculated with reference to certain percentages of Formula 1’s Prize Fund Adjusted EBIT (defined by Formula 1 as operating profit adjusted to exclude certain specific, and largely non-cash items). A share of the Prize Fund is paid to Ferrari in recognition of its heritage, with the remainder paid to Teams based on their results in prior Constructors’ Championships (a significant majority of which is based on their position in the prior year’s World Championship). Under the 2021 Concorde Agreement, the consent of 70% of the Teams is required if there are more than 24 Events in a season or if there are fewer than eight Events across Europe and North America combined.
The 2021 Concorde Agreement may be terminated with respect to a Team if the Team fails to participate in more than three Events in a season, fails to submit a valid entry for participation in the World Championship or becomes insolvent. Teams may terminate their rights and obligations pursuant to the 2021 Concorde Agreement by giving one full season’s written notice to Formula 1, as well as under certain other circumstances, including:

● | Formula 1 is unable to pay its debts when they become due;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Formula 1 fails for three months to pay an aggregate amount due in excess of $10 million to the Team; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upon the occurrence of specified compliance violations or sanctions-related events.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Circuit Rights Agreements
Under circuit rights agreements (the “Circuit Rights Agreements”), Formula 1 acquires from race promoters certain rights to commercially exploit at the Events, including the rights to sell trackside advertising and title sponsorship, the right to sell Paddock Club hospitality (other than at three Events) and commercial use of the name of the Event and circuit. In a few cases a cash payment is made for the grant of these circuit rights and in others Formula 1 offers a commission or share of revenue to a race promoter where they have been instrumental in introducing a new sponsor from its territory that purchases a title sponsorship or trackside advertising. Circuit Rights Agreements typically have a term that is tied to the relevant race promoter contract.
Intellectual Property
Formula 1 is the registered owner of a portfolio of trademark registrations and applications, including for the F1 logo, the World Championship logo (which is used only in sporting contexts), “Formula One”, “Formula 1”, “F1” and “Grand Prix” when used in connection with any of the aforementioned and most of the official Event titles where they are capable of registration.
Formula 1 owns the copyright on footage of each Event since 1981 as well as footage related to a large number of pre-1981 Events. Ownership of this copyright enables Formula 1 to license that footage to broadcasters and to take legal action against infringers of that copyright. Under the 2021 Concorde Agreement, Formula 1 also has the exclusive right, subject to limited exceptions, to use each Team’s intellectual property rights (including image rights) to portray the World Championship and/or any Event in any visual form.
Licenses and Permits
Formula 1 is required to obtain permits for the allocation and use of radio frequencies which are necessary for the operation of live camera and other equipment used in the production of live television images and also in live radio communications used by Formula 1, the FIA, the Teams (including car to pit radio transmissions) and the emergency services. Such radio frequency permits are obtained by a dedicated unit in the television production team, with assistance from the local race promoter. Typically, such radio frequency permits are obtained from the relevant governmental authority responsible for licensing the use of radio frequencies in the host country of the relevant Event. The requirements and procedures for obtaining such permits vary by country and they may involve the completion of written formalities or 

I-18



the inspection by the relevant governmental authority of all equipment to be operated with a radio frequency. Permits are typically issued subject to conditions, which Formula 1 has generally been able to satisfy.
Strategy
Formula 1’s goal is to further broaden and increase the global scale and appeal of the World Championship in order to improve the overall value of Formula 1 as a sport and its financial performance. Key factors of this strategy include:

● | continuing to seek and identify opportunities to expand and develop the Event calendar and bring Events to attractive and/or strategically important new markets outside of Europe, which typically have higher race promotion fees, while continuing to build on the foundation of the sport in Europe;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing sponsorship revenue, including increasing sales of Event-based packages and under the Global Partner program, and exploring opportunities in underexploited product categories;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capturing opportunities created by media’s evolution, including the growth of social media and the development of Formula 1’s digital media assets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | building up the entertainment experience for fans and engaging with new fans on a global basis to further drive race attendance and television viewership;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving the on-track competitive balance of the World Championship and the long term financial stability of the participating Teams; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving the environmental sustainability of Formula One and its related activities, targeting a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 and sustainable race events by 2025, and building on Formula 1’s initiatives to fight inequality and improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels.

Braves Holdings, LLC
Braves Holdings (collectively with its subsidiaries) is the indirect owner and operator of the MLB club, the Braves, certain assets and liabilities associated with Truist Park and the Mixed-Use Development. 
Business Operations
Braves Holdings derives revenue related to the Braves baseball franchise and Truist Park from ticket sales, concessions, local broadcasting rights, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, retail and licensing revenue, shared MLB revenue streams, including national broadcasting rights and licensing, and other sources. In addition, Braves Holdings derives revenue from office and retail rental income (including overage rent and tenant reimbursements) and parking and advertising sponsorships at the Mixed-Use Development.
Baseball revenue is seasonal, with the majority of revenue historically recognized during the second and third quarters, which aligns with a normal baseball regular season, consisting of 162 games. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 regular season was played entirely during the third quarter and consisted of only 60 games, all without fans in attendance. The 2020 minor league season was cancelled. The Mixed-Use Development was also affected due to the impacts of these restrictions on retail as well as restaurants, which had initially been limited to take-out and/or delivery service. Baseball revenue was significantly lower in 2020 as a result of fewer games, but improved significantly in 2021, with the return to a full regular season in each of 2021 and 2022 and the Braves’ success in the 2021 postseason as World Series Champions.
Ticket Sales. The Braves offer single game tickets, group tickets and various full and partial season ticket packages. The per-ticket average price of 2022 full-season ticket packages ranged from $8 to $535, depending upon the seating area. The Braves utilize a variable and dynamic pricing strategy to manage differences in demand and to help drive attendance and eliminate the perceived difference in value for certain games, which is often exploited in the secondary 

I-19



market. The majority of Braves tickets are distributed as mobile tickets, which allows the Braves to track important data, put parameters on resales and provide convenience and security to consumers. 
Concessions. The Braves offer food and beverages during all games held at Truist Park. In addition, the Braves generate revenue from catering in suites and premium areas within the Stadium.
Television and Radio Broadcasting. Braves Holdings derives substantial revenue from the sale of local broadcasting rights to the Braves’ baseball games. Each MLB Club has the right to authorize the television broadcast within its MLB-defined home television territory of games in which it participates, subject to certain exceptions. The Braves have a long-term local television broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC, the owner and operator of the Bally Sport South and Bally Sports Southeast video programming services (formerly known as Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast, respectively). Nationally, the Braves participate in the revenue generated from the national television, digital and radio broadcasting arrangements negotiated by MLB on behalf of the 30 MLB Clubs with ESPN, TBS, Fox, Sirius XM Holdings, Apple, YouTube and NBC/Peacock (the “National Broadcast Rights”). Under the MLB Rules and Regulations, as defined below, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (the “BOC”) has the authority, acting as the agent on behalf of all of the MLB Clubs, to enter into and administer contracts for the sale of certain National Broadcast Rights. Each MLB Club also has the right to authorize radio broadcasts, within the U.S. (or Canada, in the case of the Toronto Blue Jays), of its games, subject to certain restrictions. The Braves also have the largest radio affiliate network in MLB, with approximately 170 local radio station affiliates broadcasting Braves games across the Southeast. 
Advertising Sponsorship. The Braves work with a variety of corporate sponsors to facilitate advertising, marketing and promotional opportunities at Truist Park, the Mixed-Use Development and throughout the Braves’ home marketing territory. Advertising space is available in the Mixed-Use Development and throughout the ballpark, including on the main scoreboard, outfield walls behind home plate and in programs sold at each game. The Braves also enter into long-term licensing agreements for use of various suites, premium seating and hospitality spaces. The Braves’ marketing department works closely with the Braves’ sponsors to offer marketing opportunities, including contests, sweepstakes and additional entertainment and promotional opportunities during Braves home games, and the Braves allow their name and logo to be used in connection with certain local promotional activities throughout their home marketing territory. The Braves work closely with local television broadcasters and have a cross-promotional sponsorship and marketing agreement with Bally Sports South and Bally Sports Southeast.
Team
Player Personnel. Under the CBA and the MLB Rules and Regulations, both defined below, each team is permitted to have 40 players under reserve to the MLB Club, but is allowed to maintain only 26 players on its active roster (subject to limited exceptions) from the Opening Day of the season through August 31 of each year and the postseason. During the remainder of the season, each team may keep 28 players on its active roster. The Braves’ roster reflects the team’s commitment to developing and securing talented young players, driving future on-field success. The Braves compete with other MLB Clubs for a limited pool of player personnel and seek to assemble a roster of players with the depth and breadth the Braves believe will allow it to field a competitive team. The Braves generally enter into player contracts with terms of one or more years and may also assume an existing player contract as part of a player trade. Contract terms are required to adhere to certain league requirements as discussed below under “MLB Rules and Regulations” but are otherwise subject to market and other conditions. The Braves generally expect the majority of its roster to be composed of players with contract terms of fewer than six years. From time to time, the Braves may seek to enter into long-term contracts in order to secure talented players and reduce player turnover, however, its ability to do so may be impacted by a variety of financial and non-financial factors, including how appealing it is for a player to make a long-term commitment to the Braves.Player Development.  Starting with the 2021 season, a new player development system was put in place by MLB comprised of 11 Professional Development Leagues. MLB Professional Development Leagues, LLC ("MLB PDL") is responsible for the administration of the new system and has player development license agreements with 120 minor league clubs that compete in the Professional Development Leagues and are affiliated with MLB Clubs, including the Braves. MLB PDL is also responsible for enforcing the terms of each player development license agreement, including standards for facility quality and player working conditions. Each MLB Club, including the Braves, is affiliated with four 

I-20



Professional Development League clubs located in the U.S. and Canada. The three minor league clubs owned by Braves Holdings during the 2021 season, the Gwinnett Stripers, Mississippi Braves and Rome Braves, entered into player development license agreements with MLB PDL. Braves Holdings sold the three minor league clubs in January 2022. Each club will remain affiliated with the Braves under the terms of the license agreement, which has a 10 year term. The Augusta GreenJackets are the fourth Professional Development League club affiliated with the Braves. 
The Braves historically operated a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic and participated in the Dominican Summer League. The Braves did not fully operate the baseball academy during the 2021 season, but recommenced operations for the 2022 season. Dominican players, and players from other Latin American countries, are an important source of talent for the Braves and other MLB Clubs, but these players may not participate in the first-year amateur draft process (which is limited to only residents of the U.S., U.S. territories, and Canada, including international players who are enrolled in a high school or college in such locations). However, the Braves may enter into contracts with Latin American players, subject to the rules and regulations contained in the CBA, as defined below, and the Major League Baseball Players Association (the “MLBPA”).
Facilities
Truist Park. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves relocated to a new ballpark in Cobb County, Georgia. Braves Holdings (or its affiliates) has exclusive operating rights to the facility via a 30-year Stadium Operating Agreement with Cobb County and the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority (the “Authority”). In 2014, Braves Holdings, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 82 acres of land for the purpose of constructing a MLB facility and development of a mixed-use complex adjacent to the ballpark. The total cost of the ballpark was approximately $722 million, of which approximately $392 million was funded by a combination of Cobb County, the Cumberland Improvement District and the Authority and approximately $330 million was funded by Braves Holdings. Funding for ballpark initiatives by Braves Holdings has come from cash on hand and various debt instruments, as detailed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
We believe Truist Park is an industry-leading sports complex spanning approximately 1,100,000 square feet, with 41,200 seats, including 30 suites and 4,200 premium seats, multiple hospitality clubs and retail merchandise venues. The Stadium also features concessions and restaurant spaces, administrative offices for team operations, sales and marketing, as well as a ticket office, team clubhouse and training rooms.
CoolToday Park. In March 2019, the Braves relocated to a new spring training facility in North Port, Florida. The park is also the playing facility of the FCL Braves, the Complex League affiliate of the Braves. The Braves have exclusive operating rights to the facility via a 30-year Facility Operating Agreement with Sarasota County. The Braves operate and maintain an 8,200 capacity stadium and clubhouse facilities for major and minor league players and staff, six practice fields, a half-sized field, agility field and batting cages. The park also features an academy for housing players, coaches and staff throughout the year. The academy opened in February 2020 and includes dining, meeting and auditorium spaces.
Mixed-Use Development
The Mixed-Use Development, also known as the Battery Atlanta, is an approximately 2.25 million square-foot area located around Truist Park. Phase I of the Mixed-Use Development was completed in 2017 and includes an Omni Hotel, Comcast’s Southeast office headquarters and The Coca-Cola Roxy Theater, an entertainment venue operated through a lease with Live Nation. Phase II was completed in stages throughout 2020 and 2021 and includes TK Elevator’s North American headquarters, Papa John’s International, Inc.’s headquarters, an Aloft Hotel, a specialty market and a cinema. Phase III, consisting of a 250,000-square-foot office building immediately behind Truist Park and approximately 300 feet from home plate, commenced construction in the second half of 2022. Truist Securities announced that it will relocate its national headquarters and occupy approximately half of the building, expected to open in 2024.

MLB Rules and Regulations
As a condition to maintaining its MLB membership, each MLB Club must comply with the rules and regulations adopted by MLB, as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of a MLB Club (collectively, the “MLB Rules and Regulations”). 
Collective Bargaining Agreement. On March 10, 2022, the MLBPA and the MLB Clubs entered into a Memorandum of Understanding that summarized a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement commencing with the 2022 season (the “CBA”). The CBA covers the 2022-2026 MLB seasons. The CBA provides for an expanded playoff schedule, an increase to the previous competitive balance tax threshold on MLB Club payrolls, an annual increase in the minimum player salary each year beginning in 2022 and other provisions impacting Braves Holdings’ operations and its relationships with members of the MLBPA. Additionally, it contains provisions surrounding revenue sharing among the MLB Clubs. 
Player Contracts and Salaries. The CBA requires each MLB Club to sign Major League players using the Uniform Player’s Contract. The minimum Major League contract salary under the CBA for players during the 2022 season was $700,000 and increases in each year during the term of the current CBA. For Major League players under reserve to an MLB Club that are not eligible for salary arbitration or free agency and are not subject to a multi-year contract, MLB Clubs may renew such player contracts at the Major League minimum if they cannot reach agreement with the player on salary. However, the CBA provides that the MLB Clubs cannot reduce MLB players’ salaries by more than 20 percent of what they earned in the previous MLB season or 30 percent of what they earned two seasons prior (provided the player has remained under reserve to the MLB Club). Player salaries in 2020 were reduced to reflect the shortened season. If a player is terminated by the team for lack of skill during the championship season, he is entitled to the unpaid balance of his salary under the contract for the remainder of that season, subject to certain rights of the MLB Club. Contracts may cover one year or multiple years, but under multi-year contracts an MLB Club may be required to make minimum payments to an MLB player for the balance of the contract’s term even if the contract is terminated by the MLB Club, subject to certain rights of the MLB Club. An MLB Club may assign a player’s contract to another MLB Club (for example, in connection with a trade with that MLB Club) or a minor league club subject to certain rights of the player and other MLB Clubs.
Revenue Sharing. Each MLB Club is required to share locally derived revenue with the other MLB Clubs through MLB’s revenue sharing plan.
Debt Service Rule. Each MLB Club is subject to certain MLB imposed restrictions on its ability to incur indebtedness in amounts that exceed specified thresholds. In particular, each MLB Club is generally required to keep outstanding indebtedness minus a certain amount of excludable indebtedness at or below 8.0x available cash flow (or in the case of MLB Clubs which have a new stadium, at or below 12.0x available cash flow), with the amount of excludable indebtedness for each of fiscal years 2022 and 2023 set at $125 million and for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026 set at $100 million. This is referred to as the Debt Service Rule. MLB Clubs must certify compliance with the Debt Service Rule annually and the failure of an MLB Club to comply during two consecutive fiscal years may lead to certain remedial measures being imposed by the BOC, including, but not limited to, prohibitions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and repayment of outstanding indebtedness.
Live Nation
Live Nation is considered the world’s leading live entertainment company. 
Live Nation’s Business Segments
Concerts. Live Nation’s Concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in its owned or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues, the production of music festivals across the world, the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists. While its Concerts segment traditionally operates year-round, Live Nation generally experiences higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at its outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which 

I-22



primarily occur from May through October. Revenue is generally impacted by the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue.
​
Ticketing. Live Nation’s Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a portion of the service charge as a fee. Live Nation sells tickets for its events and also for third-party clients across multiple live event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. Live Nation sells tickets through websites, mobile apps and ticket outlets. Live Nation’s Ticketing segment also manages its online activities including enhancements to its websites and product offerings. Live Nation’s ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by its clients. 
​
Sponsorship & Advertising. Live Nation’s Sponsorship & Advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through its concert, festival, venue and ticketing assets, including advertising on Live Nation websites. Live Nation works with its corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists. Live Nation also develops, books and produces custom events or programs for its clients’ specific brands, which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers. These custom events can involve live music events with talent and media, using both online and traditional outlets. Live Nation typically experiences higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with its outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in, or occur from, May through October. 
​
Terms of Live Nation Investment
At December 31, 2022, we beneficially owned approximately 69.6 million shares of Live Nation common stock, which represented approximately 31% of the issued and outstanding shares as of December 31, 2022.
Under our stockholders agreement with Live Nation, we have the right to nominate two directors (one of whom must qualify as an independent director) to the Live Nation board of directors, currently comprised of 12 directors, for so long as our ownership interest provides us with not less than 5% of the total voting power of Live Nation’s equity securities. We also have the right to cause one of our nominees to serve on the audit committee and the compensation committee of the board, provided they meet the independence and other qualifications for membership on those committees. Live Nation has waived the director independence requirement with respect to our nominees to the Live Nation board of directors, and we have waived our right to cause one of our nominees to serve on the audit and compensation committees of the board.
We have agreed under the stockholders agreement not to acquire beneficial ownership of Live Nation equity securities that would result in our having in excess of 35% of the voting power of Live Nation’s equity securities. That percentage is subject to decrease for specified transfers of our Live Nation stock. We have been exempted from the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and Live Nation has agreed in the stockholders agreement not to take certain actions that would materially and adversely affect our ability to acquire Live Nation securities representing up to 35% of the voting power of Live Nation’s equity securities.
Other Minority Investments
We also own a portfolio of minority equity investments in public and private companies. These non-core assets may be monetized in the future, potentially through derivative and structured transactions as well as public and private sales.

Regulatory Matters
Sirius XM Holdings
Sirius XM Holdings is subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security and data protection. There are several states that require specific information security controls to protect certain types of information and specific notifications to consumers in the event of a security breach that compromises certain categories of personal information. Certain of Sirius XM Holdings’ services are also subject to laws in the U.S. and abroad pertaining to privacy of user data and other information, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation. Sirius XM Holdings’ Privacy Policies and customer agreements describe its practices. Sirius XM Holdings believes it complies with all of its obligations under all applicable laws and regulations.
As an operator of a privately owned satellite system, Sirius XM is regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:

● | the licensing of its satellite systems;
--+----------------------------------------


● | preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any assignment or transfer of control of Sirius XM’s FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC. The FCC’s order approving its merger with XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 requires Sirius XM to comply with certain voluntary commitments it made as part of the FCC merger proceeding. Sirius XM believes it complies with those commitments.
In 1997, Sirius XM was the winning bidder for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services. Sirius XM’s FCC licenses for its Sirius satellites expire in 2025 and 2030. Sirius XM’s FCC licenses for its XM satellites expire in 2023, 2026 and 2029. Sirius XM anticipates that, absent significant misconduct on its part, the FCC will renew its licenses to permit operation of its satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites.
In some areas, Sirius XM has installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement its satellite signal coverage. The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted Sirius XM a license through 2027 to operate its repeater network.
In certain cases, Sirius XM obtains FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators. Sirius XM believes its radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules.
Sirius XM is required to obtain export licenses or other approvals from the U.S. government to export certain equipment, services and technical data related to its satellites and their operations. The transfer of such equipment, services and technical data outside the U.S. or to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the U.S. government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China).
Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting Sirius XM’s services could adversely affect its ability to retain its FCC licenses or the manner in which Sirius XM operates.
Competition Laws and Formula 1
The operations and business of Formula 1 are subject to European and national competition laws which require Formula 1 at all times to ensure its business practices and agreements are consistent with the operation of competitive markets. Following an investigation by the European Commission (“E.C.”) into the commercialization of Formula 1 and related agreements in 1999, Formula 1 modified certain of its business practices and changed the terms of a number of its commercial contracts with Teams, broadcasters, promoters and the FIA. In October 2001, the E.C. issued two comfort 

I-24



letters to Formula 1 stating that it was no longer under investigation. Comfort letters are not binding on the E.C. and if it believes that there has been a material change in circumstances, further enforcement action could be taken. The E.C. issued a press release in October 2003 stating that it was satisfied that Formula 1 had complied with the modified practices and terms that had led to its issuing the 2001 comfort letters and that it had ended its monitoring of Formula 1’s compliance.
Competition
Sirius XM Holdings faces significant competition for listeners and advertisers in its Sirius XM and Pandora and Off-platform businesses, including from providers of radio and other audio services. Sirius XM Holdings’ services compete with traditional AM/FM radio. Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees. Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports. The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio may reduce the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for Sirius XM Holdings’ subscription services. Several traditional radio companies own large numbers of radio stations and other media properties, such as podcast networks. Sirius XM Holdings also faces competition from streaming and on-demand services, including Amazon Prime, Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube. Major online providers make high fidelity digital streams available at no cost or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription. Certain of these services include advanced functionality, such as personalization and customization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content. These services, in some instances, are also offered through devices sold by the service providers including Apple, Google and Amazon. For some consumers, these services compete with Sirius XM Holdings’ services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. In addition, nearly all automakers have deployed integrated multimedia systems in dashboards, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, streaming radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications. Streaming radio and other data are typically connected to the system through an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition. These systems enhance the attractiveness of internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in vehicles. Sirius XM Holdings also faces competition from a number of providers that offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems. These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home, but also include mobile entertainment. The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service. In addition, other services offered by these providers, such as cable television, on-demand video streaming, and interactive video games compete with Sirius XM Holdings’ services to the extent they utilize existing or potential users' and listeners' time that could otherwise be allocated to the use of Sirius XM or Pandora services. In addition, the audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with Sirius XM Holdings’ services now or that could compete with those services in the future. A number of providers compete with Sirius XM’s traffic services, particularly by smartphones offering GPS mapping with sophisticated data-based turn navigation. The connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers, as well as with products being developed for vehicles by automakers and other third parties. OnStar, a division of General Motors, also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles. Wireless devices, such as mobile phones, are also competitors. Sirius XM Holdings competes against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the basis of innovation, service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and system customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.
Sirius XM Holdings’ competition for advertisers includes large scale online advertising platforms such as Amazon, Facebook and Google; traditional media companies such as television broadcasters and national print outlets; broadcast radio providers; podcast distributors and networks; and companies in the broadcast radio market. Sirius XM Holdings competes against these providers for advertisers on the basis of several factors, including advertisers’ overall budgets, perceived return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of Sirius XM Holdings’ advertising platforms, the amount and scope of its data on listeners, price, delivery of large volumes or precise types of advertisements to targeted demographics, transactional capabilities and reporting capabilities. The online advertising marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, particularly with the introduction of new digital advertising technologies and expanding capabilities of larger internet companies.

I-25



With respect to Formula 1, the World Championship competes with many alternative forms of entertainment, such as other sporting and live events, for television viewership, live attendance and advertising. For example, Formula 1 competes for media rights and advertising revenue with other global and regional Tier 1 sports, including the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, Champions League and Premier League. Within national markets, Formula 1 competes with local racing events, such as the Indianapolis 500 race and NASCAR in the U.S.
Braves Holdings faces competition from many alternative forms of leisure entertainment. During the baseball season, Braves Holdings competes with other sporting and live events for game day attendance, which is integral to Braves Holdings’ ticket, concession and merchandise sales revenue. The broadcasting of the Braves’ games, which is another significant source of revenue for Braves Holdings, competes against a multitude of other media options for viewers, including premium programming, home video, pay-per-view services, subscription video on-demand services, online activities, movies and other forms of news and information. In addition, Braves Holdings competes with the other MLB teams for a limited pool of player, coaching and managerial talent. This talent contributes to the Braves’ record and league standings, which are critical components of Braves Holdings’ competitiveness.
Live Nation faces competition in the live music industry, in attracting touring artists to the venues it owns and operates and from ticketing services primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone, outlet and box office channels. Competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. Live Nation believes that it competes primarily on the basis of its ability to deliver quality music events, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences. It believes that its primary strengths include the quality of service delivered to its artists, fans, ticketing clients and corporate sponsors, its track record and reputation in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally, its artist relationships, its global footprint, the quality of its ticketing software and services, its ecommerce site and extensive database, its diverse distribution platform of venues, the scope, effectiveness and expertise of its advertising and sponsorship programs and its financial stability.
Human Capital Resources
General
As of December 31, 2022, we had 83 corporate employees, and our consolidated subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately 7,200 full and part-time employees. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Liberty and its subsidiaries strive to create diverse, inclusive and supportive workplaces, with opportunities for employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between employees and their communities.
Talent Development
Liberty fosters a strong learning culture by investing in our employees and empowering them to participate in opportunities for personal and professional growth. Some of these opportunities (which vary across our company and our subsidiaries) include tuition reimbursement for professional related coursework, executive and career coaching, paid professional seminars, paid membership in professional organizations, on-site lunch and learn educational meetings and internally led presentations on industry topics.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Liberty strives to cultivate a culture that provides a sense of belonging and inclusiveness. Our company respects diversity and the unique perspectives, ideas, skills and abilities of our employees that lead our company to achieve better business results. To reinforce this commitment to inclusion and diversity at the corporate level, Liberty supports domestic partner benefits, paid parental leave, fertility benefits, flexible work arrangements, on-going training, mentorship for female leaders and quarterly town-hall meetings with our Chief Executive Officer. 
Similarly, our subsidiaries have undertaken their own individual commitments to developing a diverse workforce. Sirius XM Holdings is focused on increasing female and minority representation at all levels of its organization, and 

I-26



recruits talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a sponsor of professional conferences focused on diverse talent, creating employment opportunities and offering leadership development. Sirius XM Holdings provides a mentoring program to help underrepresented employees benefit from coaching, guidance and feedback, and also has several employee resource groups supporting different diverse groups. Sirius XM Holdings has implemented a broad set of anti-harassment and discrimination policies and has implemented regular training and guidance regarding diversity, equity and inclusion. Braves Holdings has launched a program to provide space for employees to share perspectives, thoughts and insights and engage in thoughtful discussion with peers. Braves Holdings has also created fellowship programs to promote the hiring of diverse talent and accessibility within areas including baseball and baseball operations, data and analytics, scouting and executive leadership. Through its efforts to develop diversity within motorsport, Formula 1 seeks to find the next generation of talent emerging from underrepresented backgrounds. Following the launch of the Formula 1 Engineering Scholarship Program in 2021, Formula 1 has since committed to extending the program through 2025, supporting 10 students per year in their undergraduate and post-graduate engineering degrees at leading universities in the U.K. and Italy. In November 2022, Formula 1 announced the launch of the F1 Academy series, an all-female driver category, to develop and prepare young female drivers to progress to higher levels of competition. As part of a wider program of diversity and inclusion initiatives, Formula 1 has also committed to creating employment opportunities for those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds by offering apprenticeships and internships across the business. 
Compensation and Benefits
Liberty and its subsidiaries aim to provide attractive compensation and benefits programs for their employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary across our company and our subsidiaries) may include, among other items, bonuses, stock awards, 401(k) plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, advocacy resources, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.
COVID-19 Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we and our subsidiaries implemented changes that we consider to be in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees are working from home, and we have implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We believe we have been able to preserve our business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
