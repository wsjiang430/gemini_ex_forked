Item 1.  Business.
General
 Alcoa Corporation, a Delaware corporation, became an independent, publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, following its separation from its former parent company, Alcoa Inc. (“ParentCo” or “Arconic”) (described below).  “Regular-way” trading of Alcoa Corporation’s common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on November 1, 2016 under the ticker symbol “AA.” Alcoa Corporation’s common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share. Alcoa Corporation has its principal office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Alcoa” or the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alcoa Corporation and all subsidiaries consolidated for the purposes of its financial statements.
 Alcoa is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company is built on a foundation of strong values and operating excellence dating back 130 years to the world-changing discovery that made aluminum an affordable and vital part of modern life.  Since developing the aluminum industry, and throughout our history, our talented Alcoans have followed on with breakthrough innovations and best practices that have led to efficiency, safety, sustainability, and stronger communities wherever we operate.
 Alcoa is a global company with more than 40 operating locations across 10 countries. The Company’s operations consist of three reportable business segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. The Bauxite and Alumina segments primarily consist of a series of affiliated operating entities held in Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, a global, unincorporated joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina Limited (described below). The Aluminum segment consists of the Company’s aluminum smelting, casting, and rolling businesses, along with the majority of the energy business. 
 Aluminum, as an element, is abundant in the earth’s crust but a multi-step process is required to make aluminum metal.  Aluminum metal is produced by refining alumina oxide from bauxite into alumina, which is then smelted into aluminum and can be cast and rolled into many shapes and forms. Aluminum is a commodity traded on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) and priced daily. Alumina, an intermediary product, is subject to market pricing against the Alumina Price Index (“API”). As a result, the prices of both aluminum and alumina are subject to significant volatility and, therefore, influence the operating results of Alcoa. 
 The Company’s internet address is http://www.alcoa.com. Alcoa makes available free of charge on or through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The information on the Company’s internet site is not a part of, or incorporated by reference in, this annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at http://www.sec.gov.
 Separation Transaction in 2016
 On September 28, 2015, ParentCo announced its intention to separate ParentCo into two standalone, publicly traded companies (the “Separation Transaction”). Alcoa Upstream Corporation was formed in Delaware in March 2016 for the purpose of holding ParentCo’s Alcoa Corporation Business (as defined below) and was renamed Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction.  
 Alcoa Corporation was formed to hold ParentCo’s Bauxite, Alumina, Aluminum, Cast Products and Energy businesses, as well as ParentCo’s rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana, and ParentCo’s 25.1% interest in the Ma’aden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia (collectively, the “Alcoa Corporation Business”). Following the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation holds the assets and liabilities of ParentCo relating to those businesses and the direct and indirect subsidiary entities that operated the Alcoa Corporation Business, subject to certain exceptions. Upon completion of the Separation Transaction, ParentCo was renamed Arconic Inc. (“Arconic”) and now holds ParentCo’s Engineered Products and Solutions, Global Rolled Products (other than the rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana, and the 25.1% interest in the Ma’aden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia) and Transportation and Construction Solutions businesses (the “Arconic Business”), including those assets and liabilities of ParentCo and its direct and indirect subsidiary entities that operated the Arconic Business, subject to certain exceptions.
 In connection with the Separation Transaction, as of October 31, 2016, Alcoa Corporation entered into certain agreements with Arconic to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies to govern the relationship between Alcoa Corporation and Arconic after the completion of the Separation Transaction and allocate between Alcoa Corporation and Arconic various assets, liabilities and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. These agreements included a Separation and

Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement, and certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License, and Trademark License Agreements.
 Joint Ventures
 AWAC
 Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (“AWAC”) is an unincorporated global joint venture between Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. AWAC consists of a number of affiliated entities that own, operate or have an interest in bauxite mines and alumina refineries, as well as certain aluminum smelters, in seven countries. Alcoa Corporation owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these entities, directly or indirectly, with such entities being consolidated by Alcoa Corporation for financial reporting purposes.
 The scope of AWAC generally includes:
 
 
• | Bauxite and Alumina: The mining of bauxite and other aluminous ores as well as the refining and other processing of these ores into alumina and other ancillary operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Metallurgical Alumina: The production and sale of non-metallurgical alumina and other alumina-based chemicals; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrated Operations: Ownership and operation of certain primary aluminum smelting and other ancillary facilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Alcoa is the industrial leader of AWAC and provides the operating management for all of the operating entities forming AWAC. The operating management is subject to direction provided by the Strategic Council of AWAC, which is the principal forum for Alcoa and Alumina Limited to provide direction and counsel to the AWAC companies regarding strategic and policy matters. The Strategic Council consists of five members, three of whom are appointed by Alcoa (of which one is the Chairman of the Strategic Council), and two of whom are appointed by Alumina Limited (of which one is the Deputy Chairman of the Strategic Council).
 All matters before the Strategic Council are decided by a majority vote of the members. Certain matters require approval by at least 80% of the members, including: changes to the scope of AWAC; changes in the dividend policy; equity calls in aggregate greater than $1 billion in any year; sales of all or a majority of the AWAC assets; loans from AWAC companies to Alcoa or Alumina Limited; certain acquisitions, divestitures, expansions, curtailments or closures; certain related-party transactions; financial derivatives, hedges or swap transactions; a decision by AWAC companies to file for insolvency; and changes to pricing formula in certain offtake agreements which may be entered into between AWAC companies and Alcoa or Alumina Limited.

Exclusivity
 Under the terms of their joint venture agreements, Alcoa and Alumina Limited have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, AWAC is their exclusive vehicle for their investments, operations or participation in the bauxite and alumina business, and they will not compete with AWAC in those businesses. In the event of a change of control of either Alcoa or Alumina Limited, this exclusivity and non-compete restriction will terminate, and the partners will then have opportunities to unilaterally pursue bauxite or alumina projects outside of or within AWAC, subject to certain conditions provided in the Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategic Council.
Equity Calls
 The cash flow of AWAC and borrowings are the preferred sources of funding for the needs of AWAC. An equity call can be made on 30 days’ notice, subject to certain limitations, in the event the aggregate annual capital budget of AWAC requires an equity contribution from Alcoa and Alumina Limited.
Dividend Policy
 AWAC will generally be required to distribute at least 50% of the prior calendar quarter’s net income of each AWAC company, and certain AWAC companies will also be required to pay a distribution every three months equal to the amount of available cash above specified thresholds and subject to the forecast cash needs of the company. Alcoa will obtain a limited amount of debt funding for the AWAC companies to fund growth projects, subject to certain restrictions.
Leveraging Policy
 Debt of AWAC is subject to a limit of 30% of total capital (defined as the sum of debt (net of cash) plus any minority interest plus shareholder equity). The AWAC joint venture has raised a limited amount of debt to fund growth projects as permitted under Alcoa’s revolving credit line, in accordance with the joint venture partnership agreements. 
Saudi Arabia Joint Venture
 In December 2009, Alcoa entered into a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (“Ma’aden”), which was formed by the government of Saudi Arabia to develop its mineral resources and create a fully integrated aluminum complex in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Ma’aden is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). This project is one of the most efficient integrated aluminum production complexes within the worldwide Alcoa system. The complex includes a bauxite mine with a capacity of 4 million bone dry metric tons per year; an alumina refinery with a capacity of 1.8 million metric tons per year (“mtpy”); an aluminum smelter with a capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with a capacity of 380,000 mtpy. 
 The joint venture is comprised of three entities: the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (“MBAC”), the Ma’aden Aluminum Company (“MAC”), and the Ma’aden Rolling Company (“MRC”) (collectively, the “Ma’aden Joint Venture”). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in MAC, which holds the smelter, and in MRC, which holds the rolling mill; AWAC holds a 25.1% interest in MBAC, which holds  the mine and refinery. The refinery, smelter and rolling mill are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Manicouagan supplies approximately 27% of the electricity requirements of Alcoa’s Baie-Comeau, Quebec, smelter. Alcoa owns 40% of the joint venture.
 Bauxite
 This segment consists of the Company’s global bauxite mining operations. Bauxite is the principal raw material used to produce alumina and contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals, the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite. Bauxite is refined using the Bayer process, the principal industrial chemical process for refining bauxite to produce alumina, a compound of aluminum and oxygen that is the raw material used by smelters to produce aluminum metal. Bauxite is Alcoa’s basic raw material input for its alumina refining process. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to AWAC, located in the countries listed in the table below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of bauxite are reported on a zero-moisture basis as dry metric tons (“dmt”) unless otherwise stated. 
 Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina and sells the remainder to third parties. In 2018, Alcoa-operated mines produced 39.6 million dmt and mines operated by partnerships in which Alcoa and AWAC have equity interests produced 6.2 million dmt on a proportional equity basis, for a total Company bauxite production of 45.8 million dmt.
 Based on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts, the amount of bauxite AWAC purchases from its minority-owned joint ventures Mineração Rio do Norte S.A. (“MRN”) and Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (“CBG”) differ from its proportional equity in those mines. Therefore, in 2018, AWAC had access to 46.9 million dmt of production from its portfolio of bauxite interests and sold 5.7 million dmt of bauxite to third parties; 41.2 million dmt of bauxite was delivered to Alcoa and AWAC refineries.
 The Company is committed to growing its third-party bauxite sales business. In December 2016, the Government of Western Australia granted permission to Alcoa’s majority-owned subsidiary, Alcoa of Australia, (“AofA”), to export up to 2.5 million dmt per year of bauxite for five years to third-party customers. In addition, the Company is currently pursuing long-term 
 4


contracts with potential customers. Contracts for bauxite have generally been short-term contracts (two years or less in duration) with spot pricing and adjustments for quality and logistics. The primary customer base for third-party bauxite is located in Asia, particularly in China. 
 Bauxite Resource and Reserve Development Guidelines
 The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. “Bauxite resources” are deposits for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence (based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes), such that they are acceptable prospects for economic extraction. “Bauxite reserves” represent the part of resource deposits that can be economically mined to supply alumina refineries, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drilling grid) with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing us to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves.
 Alcoa has adopted best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. The Alcoa Ore Reserves Committee (“AORC”) is an internal group comprised of geologists and engineers that issues and administers the AORC Guidelines, which are used by all Alcoa-managed mines to classify bauxite reserves and resources. Alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) code guidelines. The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that we estimated could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions. We do not use a price for bauxite, alumina or aluminum to determine our bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the receiving alumina refinery. More specifically, reserves are set based on the chemical composition of the bauxite in order to minimize bauxite processing cost and maximize refinery economics for each individual refinery. The primary specifications that are important to this analysis are the “available alumina” content of the bauxite, which is the amount of alumina extractable from bauxite using the Bayer process, and “reactive silica” content of the bauxite, which is the amount of silica that is reactive within the Bayer process. Each alumina refinery will have a target specification for these parameters, but may receive bauxite within a range that allows blending in stockpiles to achieve the receiving refinery’s target.
 In addition to these chemical specifications, a number of other ore reserve design factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. The contours of the bauxite reserves are designed using parameters such as available alumina content cutoff grade, reactive silica cutoff grade, ore density, overburden thickness, ore thickness and mine access considerations. These parameters are generally determined by using infill drilling or geological modeling. Further, our mining locations utilize annual in-fill drilling or geological modeling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and resource classification of their bauxite based on the above-described factors.
 The following table only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the Company’s mining locations and consistent with the Company reserves strategy. Given the Company’s extensive bauxite resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally, and the length of the Company’s rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future.

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Joint Venture
 MBAC includes a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million dmt per year. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see Joint Ventures under the “General” and the Equity Investments section of Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Financial results for the Saudi Arabian mine are discussed below in “Alumina”. 
Alumina
 This segment consists of the Company’s worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. Alcoa’s largest customer for smelter grade alumina is its own aluminum smelters, which in 2018 accounted for approximately 29% of its total alumina sales. A portion of the alumina is sold to third-party customers who process it into industrial chemical products. Remaining sales are made to customers all over the world and are typically priced by reference to published spot market prices.
 This segment also includes AWAC’s 25.1% share of MBAC.
 In 2010, a number of key commodity information service providers began publishing daily and weekly alumina (spot) pricing assessments or indices rather than calculating alumina price as a percentage of the LME aluminum price, as had been done historically. Since that time, Alcoa has been systematically moving its third-party alumina sales contracts away from LME aluminum-based pricing to published alumina spot or index pricing, thus de-linking the price for alumina from the aluminum price to better reflect alumina’s distinct fundamentals. Contracts for smelter grade alumina are often multi-year, although contract structures have evolved from primarily long-term contracts with fixed or LME-based pricing to shorter-term contracts with more frequent pricing adjustment to reflect this change in pricing structure. In 2018, approximately 95% of Alcoa Corporation’s smelter grade alumina shipments to third parties were sold at published spot/index prices.

As of December 31, 2018, Alcoa had approximately 2,305,000 mtpy of idle capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 15,064,000 mtpy. As noted above, Alcoa and Ma’aden developed an alumina refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initial capacity of the refinery is 1,800,000 mtpy, and it produced approximately 1,774,000 metric tons (mt) in 2018. For additional information regarding the joint venture, see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Investments—Equity Investments.”
 In March 2015, ParentCo initiated a 12-month review of 2,800,000 mtpy in refining capacity for possible curtailment (partial or full), permanent closure or divestiture, as part of an effort to lower the position of the Company’s refining operations on the global alumina cost curve. The review resulted in the curtailment of the remaining capacity at the Suralco refinery (1,330,000 mtpy) in 2015 and the commencement of the curtailment of the remaining capacity of the Point Comfort, TX refinery (2,010,000 mtpy), which curtailment was completed in the first half of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Alcoa determined to close the Suralco alumina refinery and bauxite mines in Suriname, which have been fully curtailed since November 2015. For additional information regarding the curtailments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Information—Alumina.”

Aluminum
 This segment consists of (i) the Company’s worldwide smelting and casthouse system, (ii) a rolling mill in the United States, and (iii) a portfolio of energy assets in Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The smelting operations produce molten primary aluminum, which is then formed by the casting operations into either common alloy ingot (e.g., t-bar, sow, standard ingot) or into value-add ingot products (e.g., foundry, billet, rod, and slab). The rolling mill produces aluminum sheet primarily for the production of aluminum cans. The energy assets supply power to external customers in Brazil, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States, and internal customers within the Aluminum segment (Canadian smelters and Warrick (Indiana) smelter and rolling mill) and the Alumina segment (Brazilian refineries). This segment also includes Alcoa’s 25.1% share of MAC and MRC, the smelting and rolling mill joint venture companies in Saudi Arabia.
Smelting and Casting Operations
 Contracts for primary aluminum vary widely in duration, from multi-year supply contracts to monthly or weekly spot purchases. Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the published LME aluminum price for commodity grade P1020 aluminum, (ii) the published regional premium applicable to the delivery locale and (iii) a negotiated product premium which accounts for factors such as shape and alloy. In recent years, the Company has experienced increasing trade flows of commodity and higher value-added products between regions, with surplus regions supplying missing volumes to deficit regions. The flow patterns consider shipping costs, import duties, and premiums in the importing regions.
 Alcoa’s primary aluminum facilities and its global smelting capacity are shown in the following table:

 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 916,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 3,173,000 mtpy.
 In July 2017, Alcoa announced plans to restart three (approximately 161,000 mtpy of capacity) of the five potlines (269,000 mtpy of capacity) at the Warrick smelter (previously permanently closed in March 2016 by ParentCo). The capacity identified for restart directly supplies the existing rolling mill at the Warrick location, improves efficiency of the integrated site and provides an additional source of metal to help meet production volumes. Alcoa completed the restart of two potlines (approximately 108,000 mtpy of capacity) in mid-2018 and a third potline in December 2018 (approximately 53,000 mtpy of capacity). 
 In January 2018, a lockout of the bargained hourly employees commenced at the Bécancour smelter (see Employees below). Accordingly, management initiated a curtailment of two (approximately 207,000 mtpy (Alcoa’s share) of capacity) of the three potlines at the smelter. Additionally, in December 2018, half (approximately 52,000 mtpy (Alcoa’s share) of capacity) of the one operating potline at the Bécancour smelter was curtailed. This additional curtailment was deemed necessary to ensure continued safety and maintenance due to recent retirements and departures among the salaried workforce.
 In January 2019, Alcoa reached an agreement with workers’ representatives at the Avilés and La Coruña facilities as part of a collective dismissal process initiated in October 2018 (see Employees below). The plan calls for the curtailment of the remaining smelting capacity (approximately 124,000 mtpy combined) of the two smelters. The casthouse at each plant and the paste plant at La Coruña will remain in operation while the Company participates in a Spanish government-led process for the potential sale of the Avilés and La Coruña facilities. In accordance with the ratified agreement, the Company will maintain the smelters in the restart condition in the event an agreement to sell the plants can be reached by June 30, 2019. 
 For additional information regarding the curtailments and closures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Restructuring and Other Charges.”
 Rolling Operations
 The Aluminum segment’s rolled products business consists of the Company’s rolling mill in Warrick, Indiana, which produces aluminum sheet primarily sold directly to customers in the packaging end market for the production of aluminum cans (beverage and food) and Alcoa’s investment in a rolling mill in Saudi Arabia through the Ma’aden Rolling Company. For additional information about the Ma’aden Joint Venture, see Joint Ventures under “General” and the Equity Investments section of Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).
 Alcoa’s rolled products business has the capability of participating in several market segments, including beverage can sheet, food can sheet, lithographic sheet, and industrial products. The term “RCS” or Rigid Container Sheet is commonly used for both beverage and food can sheet. This includes the material used to produce the body of beverage containers (body stock), the lid of beverage containers (end stock and tab stock), the material to produce food can body and lids (food stock), and the material to produce aluminum bottles (bottle stock) and bottle closures (closure sheet). Alcoa suspended production of lithographic sheet in the second quarter of 2018.
 13


In 2018, our Warrick facility produced and sold 334.4 kilo metric tons (kMT) of RCS, lithographic sheet, and industrial products, of which over 99% was sold to customers in North America. The majority of its sales were coated RCS products (food stock, beverage end and tab stock). Following the Separation Transaction, both Warrick and the Ma’aden Rolling Company supply body stock material, temporarily supplemented by Arconic’s Tennessee Operations under a transition supply agreement that expired on December 31, 2018. Seasonal increases in can sheet sales are generally expected in the second and third quarters of the year.
 Can sheet demand is a function of consumer demand for beverages in aluminum packaging. Aluminum cans have a number of functional advantages for beverage companies, including product shelf life, carbonation retention, and logistics/distribution efficiency. Demand is mostly affected by overall demand for carbonated soft drinks and beer, which comprise approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, of overall aluminum can demand. In 2018, the U.S./Canada aluminum can shipments reached 94.0 billion cans, an increase of 0.6% over 2017. Alcoholic can shipments reached 35.6 billion cans, declining 2.4% year over year, while non-alcoholic can shipments were 58.4 billion, growing 2.5% year over year.
 Energy Facilities and Sources
 Employing the Bayer process, Alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore. The Company’s smelters then produce aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power. Energy accounts for approximately 20% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power accounts for approximately 24% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs.
 Electricity markets are regional. They are limited in size by physical and regulatory constraints, including the physical inability to transport electricity efficiently over long distances, the design of the electric grid, including interconnections, and by the regulatory structure imposed by various federal and state entities.
 Electricity contracts may be short term (real-time or day ahead) or years in duration, and contracts can be executed for immediate delivery or years in advance. Pricing may be fixed, indexed to an underlying fuel source or other index such as LME, cost-based or based on regional market pricing. Pricing may be all inclusive on a per energy unit delivered basis (e.g., dollars per megawatt hour) or the components may be separated and include a demand or capacity charge, an energy charge, an ancillary services charge and a transmission charge to make the delivered energy conform to customer requirements. In 2018, Alcoa generated approximately 9% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchased the remainder under long-term arrangements.
 The following table sets forth the electricity generation capacity and 2018 generation of facilities in which Alcoa Corporation has an ownership interest:

1 | Each listed facility generates hydroelectric power except the Warrick facility, which generates substantially all of the power used at the Warrick facility using nearby coal reserves from the Alcoa-owned Liberty Mine. Liberty Mine, which is operated by Vigo Coal Company, Inc., has a production capacity of approximately 1.5 million tons per year. During 2018, approximately 28% of the capacity from the Warrick power plant was sold into the market under its current operating permits. In 2019, Alcoa will purchase coal from independently-owned mines. Alcoa Power Generating Inc. also owns certain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”)-regulated transmission assets in Indiana, Tennessee, New York, and Washington.

North America | Québec The Deschambault, Baie Comeau, and Bécancour smelters in Québec purchase all or a majority of their electricity under contracts with Hydro-Québec that expire on December 31, 2029. The smelter located in Baie Comeau purchases approximately 73% of its power needs under the Hydro-Québec contract, and the remainder from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership. For the Baie Comeau smelter, the Hydro-Québec contract can be extended until February 23, 2036. Wenatchee In the State of Washington, Alcoa’s Wenatchee smelter is served by a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District No. 1 (“Chelan PUD”) under which Alcoa receives 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. In June 2018, the Company announced its decision to permanently close one of four potlines at the Wenatchee smelter, which has a remaining capacity of approximately 146,000 mtpy that has been fully curtailed since 2015. | In order to supply its smelters in the U.S. and Canada, Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources, including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. Pipeline transportation may be procured directly or via the local distribution companies. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) price. The Company may choose to reduce its exposure to NYMEX pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption.
 | Intalco Starting on January 1, 2013, the Intalco smelter, in the state of Washington, began receiving physical power under a contract with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) at the Northwest Power Act mandated industrial firm power (“IP”) rate through September 30, 2022. Additional power is purchased from the market as needed. In May 2015, the contract was amended to reduce the amount of physical power received from BPA and allow for additional purchases of market power. In April 2016, the contract was amended again to reduce the contractual amount through February 2018, following which Intalco resumed receiving physical contracted quantities of power at the mandated IP rate. In August 2018, Alcoa issued a notice of termination to BPA that will become effective on August 31, 2019, after which the Intalco smelter will purchase power from the market. | 
 | Massena West The Massena West smelter in New York receives power from the New York Power Authority (“NYPA”) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA that will expire in March 2019. The Company is currently negotiating a long-term contract with NYPA effective following the termination date. |

Australia | Portland The Portland smelter purchased electricity from the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (“SECV”) under a contract with Alcoa Portland Aluminium Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AofA, that extended to October 2016. Upon the expiration of this contract, the Portland smelter commenced to purchase power from the National Electricity Market (“NEM”) variable spot market. In March 2010, AofA and Eastern Aluminium (Portland) Pty Ltd separately entered into fixed for floating swap contracts with Loy Yang (now AGL Energy Ltd) in order to manage exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM. The fixed for floating swap contract with AGL for the Portland smelter commenced operating from the date of expiration of the contract with the SECV and was terminated in accordance with its terms, effective July 31, 2017. A new fixed for floating swap contract for the Portland smelter was entered into with AGL in January 2017 that commenced on August 1, 2017 and will expire on July 31, 2021. | Western Australia AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. More than 90% of AofA’s gas requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under long-term contracts. In 2015, AofA secured a significant portion of its gas supplies to 2032. In 2018, AofA secured three new gas supply agreements which, combined, will supply approximately 25% of the Company’s gas requirement in Western Australia from 2020. 
Europe | Spain Alcoa’s smelter at San Ciprián, Spain, purchases electricity under a bilateral spot power contract that expires December 31, 2020. Smelters at Avilés and La Coruña, Spain, purchase electricity under bilateral spot power contracts that expire December 31, 2019. As a large consumer of electricity, Alcoa participates in a demand response program in Spain, agreeing to reduce usage of electricity for a specific period of time, in return for compensation, which allows the utility or grid operator to divert electricity during times of peak demand. A competitive bidding mechanism to allocate these “interruptibility rights” in Spain was settled during 2014 to be applied starting from January 1, 2015 and with several auctions to allocate annual rights taking place since then. In May 2018, Alcoa secured 605MW of interruptibility rights for the period of June to December 2018. The last auction process to allocate rights took place in December 2018, where Alcoa secured 590MW of interruptibility rights for the period of January to June 2019 for the three Spanish smelters. Norway Alcoa owns two smelters in Norway, Lista and Mosjøen, which have historical long-term power arrangements in place that continue until the end of 2019. During 2017 and 2018, Alcoa entered into several power purchase agreements, securing approximately 45% of the necessary power for the Norwegian smelters for the period of 2020 to 2035. The Company continues to seek and negotiate additional power contracts for years subsequent to 2019. In addition, for Alcoa’s smelters in Norway, the financial compensation of the indirect carbon emissions costs passed through in the electricity bill is received in accordance with EU Commission Guidelines and Norwegian compensation regime. Iceland Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, supplies competitively priced electricity to Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland under a 40-year power contract, which will expire in 2047. | Spain To facilitate the full conversion of the San Ciprián, Spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas, in October 2013, Alúmina Española S.A. (“AE”) and Gas Natural Transporte SDG SL (“GN”) signed a take-or-pay gas pipeline utilization agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the ultimate shareholders of AE, Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited, guaranteed the payment of AE’s contracted gas pipeline utilization over the four years of the commitment period; in the event AE fails to do so, each shareholder is responsible for its respective proportionate share (i.e., 60/40). Such commitment came into force six months after the gas pipeline was put into operation by GN. The gas pipeline was completed in January 2015 and the refinery has switched to natural gas consumption for 100% of its needs. In 2018, natural gas was supplied to the San Ciprian, Spain, alumina refinery pursuant to two supply contracts with Endesa, that expired in June and December 2018, respectively, one supply contract with BP that expired in June 2018 and one supply contract with Axpo that expired in December 2018. Following the expiration of those contracts, the refinery’s natural gas requirements are supplied pursuant to supply contracts with: Endesa expiring in June 2019; Naturgy expiring in December 2019; and BP expiring in June 2020.

Certain aluminum we produce includes alloying materials. Because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce our various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an Aluminum Association (of which Alcoa is an active member) standard, which uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types.  In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well, but of lesser amounts. 
 
Competition
 Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of the aluminum supply chain in which it competes. Competitors include a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets. Brand name recognition and loyalty also play a role.  Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the Company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries. 
 In each of our business segments, we enjoy several competitive advantages. We are among the world’s largest bauxite miners, with best practices in efficient mining operations and sustainability. We are the world’s largest alumina producer outside of China and operate competitive, efficient assets across our refining, aluminum smelting, and casting portfolios.  Our business segments operate in close proximity to our broad, worldwide customer base, enabling us to meet customer demand in key markets in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and China.  Competitive advantages specific to each business segment are detailed below.
 
Bauxite:
 The third-party market for metallurgical grade bauxite is relatively new and growing quickly as global demand for bauxite increases—particularly in China. The majority of bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina for the production of aluminum. While Alcoa has historically mined bauxite for internal consumption in our alumina refineries, we are committed to expanding our third-party bauxite business to meet growing demand.
 17


Our principal competitors in the third-party bauxite market include Rio Tinto, Norsk Hydro and multiple suppliers from Guinea, India and other countries. We compete largely based on bauxite quality, price and proximity to customers. In addition to the competitive advantages described above, Alcoa has a strong competitive position in this market due to its reliable, long-term bauxite resources in strategic bauxite mine locations, including Australia, Brazil, and Guinea, which is home to the world’s largest reserves of high-quality metallurgical grade bauxite. Alcoa has a long history of stable operations in these countries and has access to large bauxite deposits with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report.
 Alumina:
 The alumina market is global and highly competitive, with many active suppliers, producers, and commodity traders. Alcoa faces competition from a number of companies, including Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, China Hongqiao Group Limited, Hindalco Industries Ltd., Hangzhou Jinjiang Group, National Aluminium Company Limited (“NALCO”), Noranda Aluminum Holding Corporation, Norsk Hydro ASA, Rio Tinto, South32 Limited, State Power Investment Corporation, United Company RUSAL Plc, and Chiping Xinfa Alumina Product Co., Ltd. In recent years, there has been significant growth in alumina refining in China and India. The majority of our product is sold in the form of smelter grade alumina, with 5% to 10% of total global alumina production being produced for non-metallurgical applications.
 Key factors influencing competition in the alumina market include: cost position, price, reliability of bauxite supply, quality and proximity to customers and end markets. While we face competition from many industry players, we had an average cost position in the first quartile of global alumina production in 2018, in part attributable to our experienced workforce and sophistication in refining technology and process automation.  Also, our refineries are strategically located next to low cost bauxite mines, and our alumina refineries are tuned to maximize efficiency with the exact bauxite qualities from these internal mines. In addition to these refining efficiencies, vertical integration affords a stable and consistent long-term supply of bauxite to our refining portfolio.
 Aluminum:
 In our Aluminum segment, competition is dependent upon the type of product we are selling.
 
The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region. We compete with commodity traders and aluminum producers such as Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, China Hongqiao Group Limited, East Hope Group Co. Ltd., Emirates Global Aluminum, Norsk Hydro, Rio Tinto, Shandong Xinfa Aluminum & Power Group, State Power Investment Co. (“SPIC”), and United Company RUSAL Plc, as well as with alternative materials such as steel, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass, each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications.
 The aluminum industry itself is highly competitive; some of the most critical competitive factors in our industry are product quality, production costs (including source and cost of energy), price, proximity to raw materials, customers and end markets, timeliness of delivery, customer service (including technical support), product innovation, and breadth of offerings. Where aluminum products compete with other materials, the diverse characteristics of aluminum are also a significant factor, particularly its light weight, strength and recyclability.
 In addition, in some end-use markets, competition is also affected by customer requirements that suppliers complete a qualification process to supply their plants. This process can be rigorous and may take many months to complete. However, the ability to obtain and maintain these qualifications can represent a competitive advantage.
 The strength of our position in the primary aluminum market is largely attributable to the following factors:
 
 
• | Low Cost Production: Alcoa leverages significant economies of scale to continuously reduce costs. As a result, Alcoa operates competitive, efficient assets across its aluminum smelting and casting portfolios. The Company’s smelting cost position is supported by long-term energy arrangements at many locations; Alcoa has secured approximately 61% of its smelter power needs through 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Value-Added Product Portfolio: Alcoa’s casthouses supply global customers with a diverse product portfolio, both in terms of shapes and alloys. We offer differentiated products that are cast into specific shapes to meet customer demand, with 67% of 2018 smelter shipments representing value-added products. 


• | Sustainability: As of December 31, 2018, approximately 70% of our aluminum smelting portfolio runs on renewable power sources, lessening our demand for fossil fuels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Alcoa owns generation and transmission assets that produce and sell electric energy and ancillary services in the United States and Brazilian wholesale energy markets. Our competitors include integrated electric utilities that may be owned by 
 18


governments (either fully or partially), cooperatives or investors, independent power producers and energy brokers and traders.
 Competition factors in open power markets include fuel supply, production costs, operational reliability, access to the power grid, and environmental attributes (e.g., green power and renewable energy credits). As electricity is difficult and cost prohibitive to store, there are no electricity inventories to cushion the impact of supply and demand factors and the resultant pricing in electricity markets may be volatile. Demand for power varies greatly both seasonally and by time of day. Supply may be impacted in the short term by unplanned generator outages or transmission congestion and longer term by planned generator outages, droughts, high precipitation levels and fuel pricing (coal and/or natural gas).
Alcoa’s energy assets enjoy several competitive advantages, when compared to other power suppliers:
 
 
• | Reliability: In the United States, we have operated our thermal energy assets for over 50 years with a high degree of reliability and expect to continue this level of performance. In Brazil, our ownership provides for assured energy from hydroelectric operations from 2032 through 2037.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustainable (“green”) energy sources: A majority of our generating assets use renewable (hydroelectric) sources of fuel for generation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our rolled products business has the capability of participating in various market segments, including beverage can sheet, food can sheet, lithographic sheet, aluminum bottle sheet, and industrial products and in the U.S. competes with other North American producers of RCS products, namely Novelis Corp, Tri-Arrows Aluminum, and Constellium NV. There is also import supply of RCS from China (Nanshan) and Western Europe (Hydro and Eval) mainly for the beverage market.
 We also compete against package types made of other materials including polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles, glass bottles, steel tin plate and other materials. 
 We compete on cost, quality, and service. The Company intends to continue to improve our cost position by increasing recycled aluminum content in our metal feedstock as well as continuing to focus on capacity utilization. We believe our team of technical and operational resources provides distinctive quality and customer service.
 
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
 The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Company’s rights under its intellectual property, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark. As a result of product development and technological advancement, the Company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world. As of December 31, 2018, Alcoa’s worldwide patent portfolio consisted of approximately 720 granted patents and 300 pending patent applications. The Company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served, including the name “Alcoa” and the Alcoa symbol.
 As part of the Separation Transaction, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic entered into certain intellection property license agreements between them. These agreements, as amended, provide for a license of certain patents, trademarks and know-how from Arconic or Alcoa Corporation, as applicable, to the other, on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
Environmental Matters
 Alcoa is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, greenhouse gas emissions, and the health and safety of our employees. We participate in environmental assessments and cleanups at approximately 60 locations. These include owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, including Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”)) sites. In 2018, capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control were approximately $145 million and approximately $75 million is expected in 2019. Additional information relating to environmental matters is included in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption “Contingencies and Commitments—Environmental Matters.”
 
19


Employees
 At the end of 2018, Alcoa had approximately 14,000 employees in 15 countries. Approximately 10,700 of these employees are represented by labor unions. In the U.S., approximately 2,400 employees are represented by various labor unions. The largest collective bargaining agreement in the U.S. is the master collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers (“USW”), which covers approximately 1,600 employees at five U.S. locations. There are three additional collective bargaining agreements at three U.S. locations with the USW, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) and the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers (IBEW), with varying expiration dates. On a regional basis, collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover approximately 2,200 employees in Europe, 1,600 employees in Canada, 1,800 employees in Central and South America, and 2,700 employees in Australia.
 The Company’s master agreement with the USW is set to expire on May 15, 2019, and Alcoa is currently negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the union.  
 The collective bargaining agreement with CSN (Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux) representing about 600 hourly employees at its Baie Comeau smelter in Canada expires on May 31, 2019.  Alcoa is preparing to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement.
 On January 11, 2018, a lockout of the bargained hourly employees commenced at the Bécancour smelter in Québec, impacting approximately 1,000 employees at this facility. The Bécancour facility is owned by Alcoa (74.95%) and Rio Tinto (25.05%). For additional information, see footnote 10 to the table in “Smelting Operations” under the Aluminum segment above.
 On August 8, 2018, the Company’s bauxite mines and alumina refineries in Australia experienced a nearly eight-week strike by the unionized labor force who are represented by the Australian Workers’ Union (AUW). These two mines continued to operate during the strike with minimal disruption. The labor force has returned to work while negotiations between the Company and the union continue. 
 On October 17, 2018, the Company announced its intention to begin a formal consultation process for collective dismissals that would affect all employees at its Avilés and La Coruña smelters in Spain.  A total of almost 700 employees will be impacted. In January 2019, Alcoa reached an agreement with workers’ representatives at these facilities ). Under this agreement, the remaining smelting capacity (approximately 124,000 mtpy combined) of the two smelters will be curtailed by the end of February 2019. The casthouse at each plant and the paste plant at La Coruña will remain in operation while the Company participates in a Spanish government-led process for the potential sale of the Avilés and La Coruña facilities. A social plan included in the agreement preserves a portion of the jobs at the two facilities and includes retirement packages and potential relocation to the Company’s San Ciprián facility. In accordance with the ratified agreement, the Company will maintain the smelters in the restart condition in the event an agreement to sell the plants can be reached by June 30, 2019.
