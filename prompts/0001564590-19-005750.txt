Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Our business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing high-quality services, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. At December 31, 2018, we operated 583 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 18,100 beds in 40 states, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added 651 beds, including 499 added to existing facilities and 152 added through the opening of two de novo facilities. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to add approximately 700 total beds exclusive of acquisitions.
 We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in the United States (“U.S.”) and the U.K. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. and U.K. through acquisitions, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.
 Acadia was formed as a limited liability company in the State of Delaware in 2005, and converted to a corporation on May 13, 2011. Our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ACHC.” Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, and our telephone number is (615) 861-6000.
 Acquisitions
 2019 Acquisitions
 On February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Whittier Pavilion (“Whittier”), an inpatient psychiatric facility with 71 beds located in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for cash consideration of approximately $17.9 million. Also on February 15, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Mission Treatment (“Mission Treatment”) for cash consideration of approximately $22.5 million and a working capital settlement. Mission Treatment operates nine comprehensive treatment centers in California, Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma.2017 Acquisition
 On November 13, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Aspire Scotland (“Aspire”), an education facility with 36 beds located in Scotland, for cash consideration of approximately $21.3 million.
 2016 Acquisitions
 During 2016, we completed the acquisition of Pocono Mountain Recovery Center (“Pocono Mountain”), TrustPoint Hospital (“TrustPoint”), Serenity Knolls (“Serenity Knolls”), and Priory Group No. 1 Limited (“Priory”) (collectively, the “2016 Acquisitions”). 
 U.K. Divestiture
 On November 30, 2016, we completed the sale of 21 existing U.K. behavioral health facilities and one de novo behavioral health facility with an aggregate of approximately 1,000 beds (collectively, the “U.K. Disposal Group”) to BC Partners (“BC Partners”) for £320 million cash (the “U.K. Divestiture”).
Financing Transactions
 On December 1, 2018, we exercised the option to redeem in whole $7.5 million and $15.5 million of Lee County (Florida) Industrial Development Authority Healthcare Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 with stated interest rates of 9.0% and 9.5% 
 1


(“9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds”) at a redemption price equal to the sum of 104% of the principal amount of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds plus accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the redemption of the 9.0% and 9.5% Revenue Bonds, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 We entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”) on April 1, 2011. On December 31, 2012, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) which amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility. We have amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement from time to time as described in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility” for additional information.
 On February 27, 2019, we entered into the Twelfth Amendment (the “Twelfth Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Twelfth Amendment, among other things, modified certain definitions, including “Consolidated EBITDA”, and increased our permitted Maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio, thereby providing increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. 
 On February 6, 2019, we entered into the Eleventh Amendment (the “Eleventh Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Eleventh Amendment, among other things, amended the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” to remove the cap on non-cash charges, losses and expenses related to the impairment of goodwill, which in turn provided increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. 
 On March 29, 2018, we entered into a Third Repricing Facilities Amendment (the “Third Repricing Facilities Amendment”, and together with the Second Repricing Facilities Amendment, the “Repricing Facilities Amendments”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Repricing Facilities Amendment replaced the existing revolving credit facility and Term Loan A facility (“TLA Facility”) with a new revolving credit facility and TLA Facility, respectively. The Company’s line of credit on its revolving credit facility remains at $500.0 million and the Third Repricing Facility Amendment reduced the size of the TLA Facility from $400.0 million to $380.0 million to reflect the then current outstanding principal. The Third Repricing Facilities Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate by 25 basis points for the revolving credit facility and the TLA Facility by amending the definition of “Applicable Rate.”
 On March 22, 2018, we entered into a Second Repricing Facilities Amendment (the “Second Repricing Facilities Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Repricing Facilities Amendment (i) replaced the Tranche B-1 Term Loan facility (the “Tranche B-1 Facility”) and the Tranche B-2 Term Loan facility (the “Tranche B-2 Facility”) with a new Term Loan B facility Tranche B-3 (the “Tranche B-3 Facility”) and a new Term Loan B facility Tranche B-4 (the “Tranche B-4 Facility”), respectively, and (ii) reduced the Applicable Rate from 2.75% to 2.50% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and reduced the Applicable Rate from 1.75% to 1.50% in the case of Base Rate Loans.
 In connection with the Repricing Facilities Amendments, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.9 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On May 10, 2017, we entered into a Third Repricing Amendment (the “Third Repricing Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Repricing Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate with respect to the Tranche B-1 Facility and the Tranche B-2 Facility from 3.0% to 2.75% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and from 2.0% to 1.75% in the case of Base Rate Loans. In connection with the Third Repricing Amendment, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.8 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On November 30, 2016, we entered into a Refinancing Facilities Amendment (the “Refinancing Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Refinancing Amendment increased our line of credit on our revolving credit facility to $500.0 million from $300.0 million and reduced our TLA Facility to $400.0 million from $600.6 million (together, the “Refinancing Facilities”). In addition, the Refinancing Amendment extended the maturity date for the Refinancing Facilities to November 30, 2021 from February 13, 2019, and lowered the effective interest rate on our line of credit on our revolving credit facility and TLA Facility by 50 basis points. In connection with the Refinancing Amendment, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.8 million, including the write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 2


On November 22, 2016, we entered into a Tenth Amendment (the “Tenth Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tenth Amendment, among other things, (i) amended the negative covenant regarding dispositions, (ii) modified the collateral package to release any real property with a fair market value of less than $5.0 million and (iii) changed certain investment, indebtedness and lien baskets.
 On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment (the “Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate with respect to our Tranche B-2 Facility from 3.75% to 3.00% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.75% to 2.00% in the case of Base Rate Loans. In connection with the Tranche B-2 Repricing Amendment, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $3.4 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
 On May 26, 2016, we entered into a Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment (the “Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Tranche B-1 Repricing Amendment reduced the Applicable Rate with respect to our Tranche B-1 Facility from 3.5% to 3.0% in the case of Eurodollar Rate loans and 2.5% to 2.0% in the case of Base Rate Loans.
 On February 16, 2016, we issued $390.0 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “6.500% Senior Notes”). The 6.500% Senior Notes mature on March 1, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 6.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2016. We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions.
 On February 16, 2016, we entered into a Second Incremental Facility Amendment (the “Second Incremental Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Incremental Amendment activated our Tranche B-2 Facility and added $135.0 million to the TLA Facility to our Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility”), subject to limited conditionality provisions. Borrowings under the Tranche B-2 Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. Borrowings under the TLA Facility were used to pay down the majority of our $300.0 million revolving credit facility.
 On January 25, 2016, we entered into the Ninth Amendment (the “Ninth Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Ninth Amendment modified certain definitions and provided increased flexibility to us in terms of our financial covenants. 
 On January 12, 2016, we completed the offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock (including shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the over-allotment option that we granted to the underwriters as part of the offering) at a public offering price of $61.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $15.8 million and additional offering related costs of $0.7 million, were approximately $685.0 million. We used the net offering proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory.
 Competitive Strengths
 Management believes the following strengths differentiate us from other providers of behavioral healthcare services:
 Premier operational management team with track record of success. Our management team has approximately 155 combined years of experience in acquiring, integrating and operating a variety of behavioral health facilities. Prior to joining Acadia in December 2018, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) served as Executive Vice President of Universal Health Services, Inc. (“UHS”) since 2005, and President of UHS’s behavioral health division since 1999. Following the sale of Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (“PSI”) to UHS in November 2010, certain of PSI’s key former executive officers joined Acadia in February 2011. The extensive national experience and operational expertise of our management team give us what management believes to be the premier leadership team in the behavioral healthcare industry. Our management team strives to use its years of experience operating behavioral healthcare facilities to generate strong cash flow and grow a profitable business.
 Favorable industry and legislative trends. According to a 2016 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“SAMHSA”), 18.3% of adults in the U.S. aged 18 years or older suffered from a mental illness in the prior year and 4.2% suffered from a serious mental illness. Further, approximately 8.0% of people aged 12 or older in 2016 were classified with a substance abuse disorder in the past year. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 20% of children, either currently or at some point in their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental disorder. Management believes the market for behavioral services will continue to grow due to increased awareness of mental health and 
 3


substance abuse conditions and treatment options. According to a 2014 SAMHSA report, national expenditures at substance abuse treatment facilities are expected to reach $42.1 billion in 2020, up from $24.3 billion in 2009.
 While the growing awareness of mental health and substance abuse conditions is expected to accelerate demand for services, recent healthcare reform in the U.S. is expected to increase access to industry services as more people obtain insurance coverage. A key aspect of reform legislation is the extension of mental health parity protections established into law by the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (the “MHPAEA”). The MHPAEA requires employers who provide behavioral health and addiction benefits to provide such coverage to the same extent as other medical conditions. On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act appropriates substantial resources for the treatment of behavioral health and substance abuse disorders and contains measures intended to strengthen the MHPAEA. On October 21, 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (“SUPPORT”) for Patients and Communities Act was signed into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act expands Medicare coverage to include Opioid Treatment Programs for services provided on or after January 2, 2020. It also includes Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its Execution Act (“IMD CARE Act”), which suspends the current prohibition on using federal Medicaid funds to pay for substance use disorder treatment at inpatient treatment facilities with more than 16 beds and limits beneficiaries to no more than 30 days of inpatient treatment per 12 month period. 
 The mental health hospitals market in the U.K. was estimated at £14.5 billion for 2016/2017. As a result of government budget constraints and an increased focus on quality, the independent mental health hospitals market has witnessed significant expansion in the last decade, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the U.K. healthcare industry. Demand for independent sector beds has grown significantly as a result of the National Health Service (the “NHS”) reducing its bed capacity and increasing hospitalization rates. Independent sector demand is expected to further increase in light of additional bed closures and reduction in community capacity by the NHS.
 Leading platform in attractive healthcare niche. We are a leading behavioral healthcare platform in an industry that is undergoing consolidation in an effort to reduce costs and expand programs to better serve the growing need for inpatient behavioral healthcare services. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. and U.K.
 Diversified revenue and payor bases. At December 31, 2018, we operated 583 facilities in 40 states, the U.K. and Puerto Rico. Our payor, patient and geographic diversity mitigates the potential risk associated with any single facility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received 33% of our revenue from public funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, Clinical Commissioning Groups (“CCGs”) and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales), 30% from Medicaid, 19% from commercial payors, 9% from Medicare and 9% from other payors. As we receive Medicaid payments from 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, management does not believe that we are significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies in any one state or territory. No facility accounted for more than 3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, and no state or U.S. territory accounted for more than 8% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our U.K. operations accounted for approximately 37% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We believe that our increased geographic diversity will mitigate the impact of any financial or budgetary pressure that may arise in a particular state or market where we operate.
 Strong cash flow generation and low capital requirements. We generate strong free cash flow by profitably operating our business and by actively managing our working capital. Moreover, as the behavioral healthcare business does not typically require the procurement and replacement of expensive medical equipment, our maintenance capital expenditure requirements are generally less than that of other facility-based healthcare providers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our maintenance capital expenditures amounted to approximately 2.5% of our revenue. 
 Business Strategy
 We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high-quality, cost-effective behavioral healthcare services, while growing our business, increasing profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we have aligned our activities around the following growth strategies:
 Increase margins by enhancing programs and improving performance at existing facilities. Management believes we can improve efficiencies and increase operating margins by utilizing our management’s expertise and experience within existing programs and their expertise in improving performance at underperforming facilities. Management believes the efficiencies can be realized by investing in growth in strong markets, addressing capital-constrained facilities that have underperformed and improving management 
 4


systems. Furthermore, our recent acquisitions of additional facilities give us an opportunity to develop a marketing strategy in many markets which should help us increase the geographic footprint from which our existing facilities attract patients and referrals.
 Opportunistically pursue acquisitions and partnerships. We have positioned our company as a leading provider of mental health services in the U.S. and the U.K. The behavioral healthcare industry in the U.S. and the independent behavioral healthcare industry in the U.K. are highly fragmented, and we selectively seek opportunities to expand and diversify our base of operations by acquiring additional facilities and entering into partnerships with healthcare providers to acquire and develop additional facilities. Acadia management believes there are a number of acquisition candidates available at attractive valuations, and we have a number of potential joint ventures and acquisitions in various stages of development and consideration in the U.S.
 Management believes our focus on behavioral healthcare and history of completing acquisitions provides us with a strategic advantage in sourcing, evaluating and closing acquisitions. We leverage our management team’s expertise to identify and integrate acquisitions based on a disciplined acquisition strategy that focuses on quality of service, return on investment and strategic benefits. We also have a comprehensive post-acquisition strategic plan to facilitate the integration of acquired facilities that includes improving facility operations, retaining and recruiting psychiatrists and other healthcare professionals and expanding the breadth of services offered by the facilities.
 Drive organic growth of existing facilities. We seek to increase revenue at our facilities by providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients. In addition, management intends to increase bed counts in our existing facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we added 651 beds, including 499 added to existing facilities and 152 added through the opening of two de novo facilities. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to add approximately 700 total beds exclusive of acquisitions. Furthermore, management believes that opportunities exist to leverage out-of-state referrals to increase volume and minimize payor concentration in the U.S., especially with respect to our youth and adolescent focused services and our substance abuse services.
 U.S. Operations
 Our U.S. facilities and services can generally be classified into the following categories: acute inpatient psychiatric facilities; specialty treatment facilities; residential treatment centers; and outpatient community-based services. The table below presents the percentage of our total U.S. revenue attributed to each category for the year ended December 31, 2018:
 
 
Facility/Service | U.S. Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 | 
---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+---
Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities | | 43 | %
Specialty treatment facilities | | 40 | %
Residential treatment centers | | 15 | %
Outpatient community-based services | | 2 | %

 
We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our U.S. facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”); and (iv) individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2018 in our U.S. facilities, we received 47% of our revenue from Medicaid, 30% from commercial payors, 15% from Medicare and 8% from other payors.
 At December 31, 2018, our U.S. facilities included 213 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 9,300 beds in 40 states and Puerto Rico. Of our U.S. facilities, excluding comprehensive treatment centers (“CTCs”), approximately 41% are acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, approximately 41% are specialty treatment facilities, approximately 15% are residential treatment centers and approximately 3% are outpatient community-based service facilities at December 31, 2018. Of the 213 behavioral healthcare facilities, 116 are CTCs which is a subset of specialty treatment facilities. Of our CTCs, 18 are owned properties and 98 are leased properties. Of the 97 facilities that are not CTCs, 77 are owned properties and 20 are leased properties. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our U.S. operations generated revenue of $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
 Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities
 Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities provide a high level of care in order to stabilize patients that are either a threat to themselves or to others. The acute setting provides 24-hour observation, daily intervention and monitoring by psychiatrists. Generally, due to shorter lengths of stay, the related higher patient turnover, and the special security and health precautions required, acute inpatient psychiatric facilities have lower average occupancy than residential treatment centers. Our facilities that offer acute care services provide evaluation and crisis stabilization of patients with severe psychiatric diagnoses through a medical delivery model that 
 5


incorporates structured and intensive medical and behavioral therapies with 24-hour monitoring by a psychiatrist, psychiatric trained nurses, therapists and other direct care staff. Lengths of stay for crisis stabilization and acute care range from three to five days and from five to twelve days, respectively.
 Specialty Treatment Facilities
 Our specialty treatment facilities include residential recovery facilities, eating disorder facilities and CTCs. We provide a comprehensive continuum of care for adults with addictive disorders and co-occurring mental disorders. Our detoxification, inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient treatment programs are cost-effective and give patients access to the least restrictive level of care. All programs offer individualized treatment in a supportive and nurturing environment.
 The majority of our specialty treatment services are provided to patients who abuse addictive substances such as alcohol, illicit drugs or opiates, including prescription drugs. Some of our facilities also treat other addictions and behavioral disorders such as chronic pain, sexual compulsivity, compulsive gambling, mood disorders, emotional trauma and abuse. The goal of our treatment facilities is to provide the appropriate level of treatment to an individual no matter where they are in the lifecycle of their disease in order to restore the individual to a healthier, more productive life, free from dependence on illicit substances and destructive behaviors. Our treatment facilities provide a number of different treatment services such as assessment, detoxification, medication-assisted treatment, counseling, education, lectures and group therapy. We assess and evaluate the medical, psychological and emotional needs of the patient and address these needs in the treatment process. Following this assessment, an individualized treatment program is designed to provide a foundation for a lifelong recovery process. Many modalities are used in our treatment programs to support the individual, including the twelve step philosophy, cognitive/behavioral therapies, supportive therapies and continuing care.
 Residential Recovery Facilities. Our inpatient facilities house and care for patients over an extended period and typically treat patients from a broadly defined regional market. We provide three basic levels of residential treatment depending on the severity of the patient’s addiction and/or behavioral disorder. Patients with the most severe dependencies are typically placed into inpatient treatment, in which the patient resides at a treatment facility. If a patient’s condition is less severe, he or she will be offered day treatment, which allows the patient to return home in the evening. The least intensive service is where the patient visits the facility for just a few hours a week to attend counseling/group sessions.
 Following primary treatment, our extended care programs typically offer residential care, which allows patients to develop healthy and appropriate living skills while remaining in a safe and nurturing setting. Patients are supported in their recovery by a semi-structured living environment that allows them to begin the process of employment or to pursue educational goals and to take personal responsibility for their recovery. The structure of this treatment phase is monitored by a primary therapist who works with each patient to integrate recovery skills and build a foundation of sobriety with a strong support system. Length of stay will vary depending on the patient’s needs with a minimum stay of 30 days and could be multiple months if needed.
 Our outpatient clinics serve patients that do not require inpatient treatment or are transitioning from a residential treatment program; have employment, family or school commitments; and have stabilized in their substance addiction recovery practices and are seeking ongoing continuing care.
 Eating Disorder Facilities. Our eating disorder facilities provide treatment services for eating disorders and weight management, each of which may be effectively treated through a combination of medical, psychological and social treatment programs.
 Comprehensive Treatment Centers. Our CTCs specialize in providing medication-assisted and abstinent-based treatment. Medication-assisted treatment combines behavioral therapy and medication to treat substance use disorders. CTCs utilize medication-assisted treatment to individuals addicted to opiates such as opioid analgesics (prescription pain medications) and heroin. Medication is used to normalize brain chemistry to block the euphoric effects of alcohol and opioids allowing our professional staff to provide behavioral therapy. Patients begin their treatment attending the clinic almost daily. Then, through successfully progressing in treatment, patients attend less frequently depending on individual treatment plans. The length of treatment differs from patient to patient, but typically ranges from one to three years.
 Each of our CTCs provide a range of comprehensive substance abuse treatment support services that include medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other treatment services. Our behavioral therapies are delivered in an array of treatment models that may include individual and group therapy, intensive outpatient, outpatient, partial hospitalization/day treatment, road to recovery, and other programs that can be either abstinent or medication assisted based.

Residential Treatment Centers
 Residential treatment centers treat patients with behavioral disorders in a non-hospital setting, including outdoor programs. The facilities balance therapy activities with social, academic and other activities. Because the setting is less intensive, demands on staffing, security and oversight are generally lower than inpatient psychiatric facilities. In contrast to acute care psychiatric facilities, occupancy in residential treatment centers can be managed more easily given a longer length of stay. Over time, however, residential treatment centers have continued to serve increasingly severe patients who would have been treated in acute care facilities in earlier years.
 We provide residential treatment care through a medical model residential treatment facility, which offers intensive, medically-driven interventions and individualized treatment regimens designed to deal with moderate to high level patient acuity. Children and adolescents admitted to these facilities typically have had multiple prior failed treatment plans, severe physical, sexual and emotional abuse, termination of parental custody, substance abuse, marked deficiencies in social, interpersonal and academic skills and a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Treatment typically is provided by an interdisciplinary team coordinating psychopharmacological, individual, group and family therapy, along with specialized accredited educational programs in both secure and unlocked environments. Lengths of stay range from three months to several years.
 Certain of our residential treatment centers provide group home, therapeutic group home and therapeutic foster care programs. Our group home programs provide family-style living for youths in a single house or apartment within residential communities where supervision and support are provided by 24-hour staff. The goal of a group home program is to teach family living and social skills through individual and group counseling sessions within a real life environment. The residents are encouraged to take responsibility for the home and their health as well as actively take part in community functions. Most attend an accredited and licensed on-premises school or a local public school. We also operate therapeutic group homes that provide comprehensive treatment services for seriously, emotionally disturbed adolescents. The ultimate goal is to reunite or place these children with their families or prepare them, when appropriate, for permanent placement with a relative or an adoptive family. We also manage therapeutic foster care programs, which are considered the least restrictive form of therapeutic placement for children and adolescents with emotional disorders. Children and adolescents in our therapeutic foster care programs often are part of the child welfare or juvenile justice system. Care is delivered in private homes with experienced foster parents who are trained to work with children and adolescents with special needs.
 Outpatient Community-Based Services
 Our community-based services can be divided into two age groups: children and adolescents (seven to 18 years of age) and young children (three months to six years of age). Community-based programs are designed to provide therapeutic treatment to children and adolescents who have a clinically-defined emotional, psychiatric or chemical dependency disorder while enabling the youth to remain at home and within their community. Many patients who participate in community-based programs have transitioned out of a residential facility or have a disorder that does not require placement in a facility that provides 24-hour care.
 Community-based programs developed for these age groups provide a unique array of therapeutic services to a very high-risk population of children. These children suffer from severe congenital, neurobiological, speech/motor and early onset psychiatric disorders. These services are provided in clinics and employ a treatment model that is consistent with our interdisciplinary medical treatment approach. Depending on their individual needs and treatment plan, children receive speech, physical, occupational and psychiatric interventions that are coordinated with services provided by their referring primary care physician. The children generally receive treatment during regular business hours.
 U.K. Operations
 Overview
 We are the leading independent provider of mental health services in the U.K. operating 370 inpatient behavioral health facilities with approximately 8,800 beds at December 31, 2018. The facilities are located in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our U.K. operations generated revenue of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, primarily through the operation and management of inpatient behavioral health facilities. 
United Kingdom Healthcare and Adult Social Care Sectors
 In the U.K., central government spending on health for fiscal year 2018-2019 is budgeted at approximately £152 billion, according to the U.K. government budget. This spending is primarily delivered by the NHS, which operates as three separate national public sector bodies in England, Scotland and Wales as well as the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board. Local Government gross spending on adult social care for the fiscal year 2018-2019 is budgeted at approximately £24 billion and is commissioned by 
 7


local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales, which we refer to as Local Authorities and by the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board. The NHS, Local Authorities and Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board commissioners dominate the U.K. health and social care markets in terms of the funding of care. With the exception of the elderly residential and nursing care market, private health insurance and self-payment play a minor role in these sectors.
 The mental health market in the U.K. was estimated at £14.5 billion for 2016/2017. The independent mental health market accounted for roughly £1.6 billion of that amount, or approximately 11% market share. In the last 15 years, the independent mental health market has witnessed significant expansion mainly due to NHS outsourcing as the number of NHS in-house beds has declined. However, since 2015 overall independent sector mental health hospital bed capacity has remained largely the same.
 Publicly-funded healthcare services in England are commissioned at two levels as follows: (i) nationally by NHS England which, via its Local Area Teams commissions specialized healthcare services, including specialized Mental Health Secure, Eating Disorder and Children and Adolescent (“CAMHS”) services, and (ii) locally by over 200 local CCGs, which commission all acute, rehabilitation and community-based healthcare services. In Scotland and Wales, all healthcare services are commissioned by Local/Regional Health Boards.
 The principal distinction between healthcare and social care relates to an individual’s assessed care needs. If there is a primary health need, services are commissioned by the NHS under the general NHS principle that the services are free at the point of delivery. In the case of adult social care, individuals’ healthcare-related needs have been assessed as being of secondary importance with services being means-tested. Local Authority commissioners of adult social care provided in care homes and other community settings are responsible for undertaking financial assessments to determine the level of contributions that individuals must pay towards the cost of their care. Individuals with income or capital above set statutory thresholds must fund the full cost of their care.
 In recent years, the U.K. Government has placed increasing emphasis on implementing integrated care pathways across health and social care services. Integrated care pathways provide patients with highly coordinated and personalized care overseen by relevant commissioners working together to plan, arrange and monitor patient progression through each stage of the care pathway.
 Additionally, mental health commissioning trends toward moving patients more quickly down care pathways, out of higher acuity, more intensive care settings towards community focused care services have increased the demand for community and rehabilitation services in the independent mental health market. The Department of Health in England recently identified priorities for essential change in mental health that include, among other things, funding providers based on the quality of their service rather than volume of patients, allocating funds to support specialized housing for people with mental health problems and adopting a new rating system and inspection process to improve the quality of care. Increasing political focus on the provision of mental health services in the U.K. and increasing support for the rights of mental health patients are expected to lead to further increases in the size of the mental health market in the U.K. In addition, rising demand for mental health services in the U.K. coupled with a constrained mental healthcare funding environment are increasing pressure to improve operational efficiency and refer patients to single provider programs with care pathways that more appropriately reflect each patient’s specific mental health needs. As a result of these pressures, government reforms to NHS competition rules and an increased focus on quality, the independent mental health market witnessed significant expansion in the last decade, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the U.K. healthcare industry.
 Within its Long Term Plan for the NHS published in January 2019, NHS England set out its commitment to grow investment in mental health services faster than the NHS budget overall for each of the next five years such that Mental Health will receive a growing share of the NHS budget, worth at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/2024.
 NHS England plans to set up a network of Integrated Care Systems covering all of England by 2021 to deliver the ‘triple integration’ of primary and specialist care, physical and mental health services, and health with social care. NHS England’s focus is upon collaboration rather than competition between providers and has recommended the reversal of many of the NHS competition reforms that had been introduced by the government in 2012.
 Description of U.K. Facilities
 In the U.K., we provide inpatient services through a variety of facilities, including mental health hospitals, clinics, care homes, schools, colleges and children’s homes. In addition to these services, we also operate a U.K. division that leverages on our clinical knowledge to provide Employee Assistance Programs (“EAP”) to organizations.

Our U.K. facilities and services can generally be classified into the following categories: healthcare facilities, education and children’s services and adult care facilities. The table below presents the percentage of our total U.K. revenue attributed to each category for the year ended December 31, 2018:
 
 
Facility/Service | U.K. Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 | 
----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+---
Healthcare facilities | | 56 | %
Education and Children’s Services | | 17 | %
Adult Care facilities | | 27 | %

 
We receive payments from approximately 500 public funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales) and individual patients and clients. For the year ended December 31, 2018 in our U.K. facilities, we received 90% of our revenue from public funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales) and 10% from other payors.
 At December 31, 2018, our U.K. facilities included 370 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 8,800 beds, including approximately 1,100 non-residential education places, in the U.K. Of our U.K. facilities, approximately 23% are healthcare facilities, approximately 19% are education and children’s services facilities and approximately 58% are adult care facilities at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, 292 of our U.K. facilities are owned properties and 78 are leased properties.
 Healthcare
 In the U.K., mental health hospitals provide psychiatric treatment and nursing for sufferers of mental disorders, including for patients detained under a section of the U.K.’s Mental Health Act of 1983 and 2007, and whose risk of harm to others and risk of escape from hospitals cannot be managed safely within other mental health settings. In order to manage the risks involved with treating patients, the facility is managed through the application of a range of security measures depending on the level of dependency and risk exhibited by the patient. The levels of dependency and risk stemming from the wide range of disorders treated at these hospitals determine the level of care provided, which are comprised of:

• | Secure Services. Medium and Low secure facilities treat patients who may present a serious danger to others and themselves but do not need the physical security arrangements of a high security hospital. The purpose of medium secure services is to provide effective care and treatment to reduce risk, promote recovery and support patients moving through the care pathway to lower levels of security or to reestablishing themselves successfully in the community. Low secure facilities provide treatment for patients whom, because of the level of risk or challenge they present, cannot be treated in open mental health settings. Low secure services deliver intensive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary treatment to patients demonstrating disturbed behavior in the context of a serious mental disorder and require the provision of security but pose a lesser risk of harm to themselves and to others.

Sources of Revenue
 We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS; (iv) public funded sources in the U.K. (including the NHS, CCGs and local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales); and (v) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue and Accounts Receivable” for additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenue, income and other operating information is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regulation
 U.S. Overview
 The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare program participation requirements, various licensure and accreditation standards, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and government healthcare program fraud and abuse provisions. Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to loss or limitation of licenses to operate, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. 
Licensing, Certification and Accreditation
 All of our facilities must comply with various federal, state and local licensing and certification regulations and undergo periodic inspection by licensing agencies to certify compliance with such regulations. The initial and continued licensure of our facilities and certification to participate in government healthcare programs depends upon many factors including various state licensure regulations relating to quality of care, environment of care, equipment, services, staff training, personnel and the existence of adequate policies, procedures and controls. Federal, state and local agencies survey our facilities on a regular basis to determine whether the facilities are in compliance with regulatory operating and health standards and conditions for participating in government healthcare programs.
 Most of our inpatient and residential facilities maintain accreditation from private entities, such as The Joint Commission or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (“CARF”). The Joint Commission and CARF are private organizations that have accreditation programs for a broad spectrum of healthcare facilities. The Joint Commission accredits a broad variety of healthcare organizations, including hospitals and behavioral health organizations. CARF accredits behavioral health organizations 
 10


providing mental health and alcohol and drug use and addiction services, as well as opiate treatment programs, and many other types of healthcare programs. These accreditation programs are intended generally to improve the quality, safety, outcomes and value of healthcare services provided by accredited facilities. Certain federal and state licensing agencies as well as many in government and private healthcare payment programs require that providers be accredited as a condition of licensure, certification or participation. Accreditation is typically granted for a specified period, ranging from one to three years, and renewals of accreditation generally require completion of a renewal application and an on-site renewal survey.
 Certificates of Need
 Many of the states in which we operate facilities have enacted certificate of need (“CON”) laws that regulate the construction or expansion of certain healthcare facilities, certain capital expenditures or changes in services or bed capacity. Failure to obtain CON approval of certain activities can result in: our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement; the imposition of civil penalties; the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement; or the revocation of a facility’s license, any of which could harm our business.
Audits
 Our healthcare facilities are also subject to federal, state and commercial payor audits to validate the accuracy of claims submitted to the government healthcare programs and commercial payors. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to make substantial repayments, subject to various appeal rights. Several of our facilities have undergone claims audits related to their receipt of payments during the last several years with no material overpayments identified. However, potential liability from future audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations, as well as commercial payor contracts, also provide for withholding or suspending payments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.
The Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law
 The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, in cash or in kind, as an inducement or reward for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items paid for by a government healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute may be found to have been violated if at least one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A provider is not required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute to be found guilty of violating the law.
 The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has issued safe harbor regulations that protect certain types of common arrangements from prosecution or sanction under the Anti-Kickback Statute and there are also several statutory exceptions toward that end. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements falling outside the safe harbors may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
 Although management believes that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws.
 In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to healthcare entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship for the furnishing of any “designated health services” unless certain exceptions apply. A violation of the Stark Law may result in a denial of payment; required refunds to the Medicare program; imposition of civil monetary penalties of up to $24,748 for each prohibited claim, up to $164,992 for circumvention schemes, and up to $19,639 for each day the entity fails to report required information; exclusion from government healthcare programs; and liability under the False Claims Act. There are ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions for many customary financial arrangements between physicians and facilities, including the employment exception, personal services exception, lease exception and certain recruitment exceptions. Management believes that our financial arrangements with physicians are structured to comply with the regulatory exceptions to the Stark Law. However, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that no intent is required to violate the law, and even a technical violation may lead to significant penalties.
 These laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we do not have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our arrangements relating to facilities, 
 11


equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict whether other federal or state legislation or regulations will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.
 If we are deemed to have failed to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties, and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the government healthcare programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act 
 In October 2018, President Trump signed into law the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”). The SUPPORT Act contains a number of provisions aimed at identifying at-risk individuals, increasing access to opioid abuse treatment, reducing overprescribing, and promoting data sharing with the primary goal of reducing the use and abuse of opioids. Additionally, the SUPPORT Act attempts to address the problem of “patient brokering” in the context of addiction treatment facilities and sober homes. 
 One section of the SUPPORT Act, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (“EKRA”), makes it a federal crime to knowingly and willfully: (1) solicit or receive any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (2) pay or offer any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Each conviction under the EKRA is punishable by up to $200,000 in monetary damages, imprisonment for up to ten (10) years, or both. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statutes, EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government healthcare program. The EKRA also contains exceptions similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors, but those exceptions are more narrow than the Anti-Kickback Statute Safe Harbors such that practices that would be permissible under the Anti-Kickback Statute may violate EKRA.
 Federal False Claims Act and Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 The federal False Claims Act provides the government a tool to pursue healthcare providers for submitting false claims or requests for payment for healthcare items or services. Under the False Claims Act, the government may fine any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly submits, or causes the submission of, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal government has widely used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other federal healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. Claims for services or items rendered in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law can provide a basis for liability under the False Claims Act as well. The False Claims Act is also implicated by the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later.
 Violations of the False Claims Act are punishable by significant penalties totaling $11,181 to $22,363 for each fraudulent claim plus three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. In addition, under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, private parties may bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, known as relators, are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, whistleblower lawsuits have increased significantly in recent years. Many states have similar false claims statutes that impose liability for the types of acts prohibited by the False Claims Act or that otherwise prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the state government or Medicaid program.
 In addition to the False Claims Act, the federal government may use several criminal laws, such as the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, or health care fraud statutes, to prosecute the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Most states have also adopted generally applicable insurance fraud statutes and regulations that prohibit healthcare providers from submitting inaccurate, incorrect, or misleading claims to private insurance companies. Management believes our healthcare facilities have implemented appropriate safeguards and procedures to complete claim forms and requests for payment in an accurate manner and to operate in compliance with applicable laws. However, the possibility of billing or other errors can never be completely eliminated, and we cannot guarantee that the government or a qui tam plaintiff, upon audit or review, would not take the position that billing or other errors, should they occur, are violations of the False Claims Act.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements
 The administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of individually identifiable protected health information (“PHI”). The privacy and security regulations control the use and disclosure of PHI and the rights of patients to be informed about and control how such PHI is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.
 The HIPAA security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI. HITECH has strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of PHI, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created security breach notification requirements including notifications to the individuals affected by the breach, the Department of Health and Human Services, and in certain cases, the media. HITECH has also increased maximum penalties for violations of HIPAA privacy rules. Management believes that we have been in material compliance with the HIPAA regulations and have developed our policies and procedures to ensure ongoing compliance, although we cannot guarantee that our facilities will not be subject to security incidents or breaches which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act
 The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is intended to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. Section 1867 of the Social Security Act imposes specific obligations on Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical screening examination when a request is made for examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition regardless of an individual’s ability to pay. Hospitals are then required to provide stabilizing treatment for patients with emergency medical conditions. If a hospital is unable to stabilize a patient within its capability, or if the patient requests, an appropriate transfer must be implemented. EMTALA imposes additional obligations on hospitals with specialized capabilities, such as ours, to accept the transfer of patients in need of such specialized capabilities if those patients present in the emergency room of a hospital that does not possess the specialized capabilities.
Mental Health Parity Legislation
 The MHPAEA was signed into law in October 2008 and requires health insurance plans that offer mental health and addiction coverage to provide that coverage on par with financial and treatment coverage offered for other illnesses. The MHPAEA has some limitations because health plans that do not already cover mental health treatments are not required to do so, and health plans are not required to provide coverage for every mental health condition published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. The MHPAEA also contains a cost exemption which operates to exempt a group health plan from the MHPAEA’s requirements if compliance with the MHPAEA becomes too costly.
 On December 13, 2016, then President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act appropriated substantial resources for the treatment of behavioral health and substance abuse disorders and contained measures intended to strengthen the MHPAEA. 
 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “PPACA”) dramatically altered the U.S. health care system. PPACA sought to provide coverage and access to substantially all Americans, to increase the quality of care provided, and to reduce the rate of growth in health care expenditures. PPACA attempted to achieve these goals by, among other things, requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, expanding the Medicare program’s use of value-based purchasing programs, bundling payments to hospitals and other providers, reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments to providers, expanding Medicaid eligibility, and tying reimbursement to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria.
 On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump became President of the United States. Shortly after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order that, among other things, stated that it was the intent of his administration to repeal PPACA and, pending that repeal, instructed the executive branch of the federal government to defer or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of PPACA that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost, fee, tax, or penalty on any individual, family, health care provider, or health insurer. Several bills have been introduced and voted upon in the House of Representatives and United States Senate that would either repeal and replace or simply repeal PPACA, although none have been enacted to-date.
 13


On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order intending to expand the availability of so-called association health plans and short-term plans outside PPACA’s requirements. President Trump also announced that the administration would cease making cost-sharing reduction payments to health insurance companies that help cover out-of-pocket costs for low-income individuals. Finally, the Tax Act (as defined and described below) effectively eliminated PPACA’s individual health insurance mandate as of 2018 by reducing to zero the tax penalty associated with failure to maintain health insurance coverage.
 During the 2018 election cycle Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives, effectively eliminating the possibility that PPACA will be repealed entirely during the next two years. Still, it remains difficult to predict whether PPACA will be replaced or modified; what the effect will be of the health care-related provisions in the Tax Act; or the impact that the President’s executive actions will have on the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of PPACA or the regulations adopted or to be adopted to implement the law or the President’s executive orders. In addition, if PPACA is replaced or modified, it remains unclear what the replacement plan or modifications would be, when the changes would become effective, or whether any of the existing provisions of PPACA would remain in place. 
 In 2018, federal district court judge in Texas ruled that PPACA in its entirety is invalid. That decision has been stayed pending appeal, and will likely remain unresolved until finally decided by the United States Supreme Court. 
 There have been and likely will continue to be a number of legal challenges to various provisions of the law and President Trump’s executive actions. Limitations on the availability of adequate insurance coverage for patients seeking services at our facilities; any reductions in government healthcare spending; and the possible repeal, replacement or modification of PPACA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 U.S. Tax Reform
 On December 22, 2017, Public Law 115-97, informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law. The Tax Act provided for significant changes to the U.S. tax code that has impacted businesses. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% for U.S. taxable income. The Tax Act included other changes, including, but not limited to, a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income, a limitation of the deduction for net operating losses, elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, immediate deductions for depreciation expense for certain qualified property, additional limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest. 
 The Tax Act required a one-time remeasurement of deferred taxes to reflect their value at a lower tax rate of 21% and a one-time transition tax on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years. Further information on the Company’s accounting for such tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act can be found in the consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to assess the impact of the Tax Act on its business.   
 U.K. Overview
 The regulatory environment applicable to facilities in the U.K. is complex and multifaceted. The regulatory regime is made up of multiple statutes, regulations and minimum standards that are subject to continuous change. The laws and regulations applicable to the U.K. facilities include, without limitation, the Mental Capacity Act of 2005, Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006, Mental Health Act of 2007, Health and Social Care Act of 2008 and Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007. These laws and regulations are predominantly protective in nature and share the same general underlying purpose to protect vulnerable persons from exploitation or harm. The regulatory requirements relevant to our facilities in the U.K. cover our operations from the initial establishments of new facilities, which are subject to registration and licensing requirements, to the recruitment and appointment of staff, occupational health and safety, duty of care to service users, clinical and educational standards, conduct of our professional and support staff and other areas.
 Mental Capacity Act of 2005. The Mental Capacity Act of 2005 establishes the process for determining whether a person lacks mental capacity at a particular time and also sets out who can make decisions in those circumstances and how they should go about this. The Act sets out when liability may arise for actions in connection with the care or treatment of persons who lack capacity to consent to such actions.
 Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006. The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act of 2006 created the Independent Safeguarding Authority (“ISA”). In December 2012, the ISA merged with the Criminal Records Bureau to form the Discharge and Barring Service (“DBS”) and is required to establish and maintain lists of persons barred from working with children and adults. It is a criminal offense for a barred person to seek to work, or work in, activities from which they are barred. It is also generally a criminal 
 14


offense for an employer to allow a barred person, or person who is not appropriately registered, to work in any regulated activity. The Children Act 1989 also allocates duties to Local Authorities, courts, parents, and other agencies in the U.K. to ensure children are safeguarded and their welfare is promoted.
 The Mental Health Act of 2007. The Mental Health Act of 2007 regulates the manner in which an individual can be committed or detained against his or her will. The main purpose of the legislation is to ensure that people with serious mental disorders which threaten their health or safety or the safety of the public can be treated irrespective of their consent where it is necessary to prevent them from harming themselves or others. The Act places the burden on the entity detaining a person to prove that the entity has the right to hold the detainee. This places a substantial regulatory burden on service providers to ensure compliance with the law. There is similar legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
 The Health and Social Care Act of 2008. The Health and Social Care Act of 2008 (“HSCA”), as amended by the Care Act 2014, established the Care Quality Commission (“CQC”) as the registration and regulatory body for health and adult social care in England. Under the HSCA, service providers carrying out “regulated activities” must be registered with the CQC for each separate regulated activity provided. Where the service provider is a company, each regulated activity/location must also have an individual registered as the registered manager. Registration depends both on an assessment of the fitness of the registered provider and also the individual registered manager. Regulated activities include the provision of residential accommodation together with nursing or personal care and the provision of treatment for a disease, disorder or injury by or under the supervision of a social worker or a multidisciplinary team which includes a social worker where the treatment is for a mental disorder.
 The Care Act 2014. The Care Act 2014 came into force on April 1, 2015 along with a range of supporting regulations and a single set of statutory guidance. The Care Act 2014 requires Local Authorities to set personal budgets for individuals that are appropriate to meeting those individuals’ assessed eligible care and support needs. The Care Act 2014 also imposes new statutory duties upon Local Authorities to ensure the supply of diverse, good quality, local services, including a duty to plan for future demand and to ensure that services are high quality and sustainable.
 The regulated activities regulations and the registration regulations issued pursuant to the HSCA place legally binding obligations on health and social care providers. Breach of certain provisions of the HSCA or the regulations is a criminal offense. In addition, a breach may lead to the CQC taking action to suspend, cancel or vary the conditions of registration of a service provider or impose a substantial fine.
 Inspections by regulators in the U.K. can be carried out on both an announced and an unannounced basis depending on the specific regulatory provisions relating to the different services provided and also depending upon whether the inspection is routine or as a result of specific information regarding the service that has been provided to the regulator. Generally, however, a majority of inspections tend to be unannounced. A failure to comply with laws and regulations, the receipt of a poor inspection report rating or a lower rating, or the receipt of a negative report that leads to a determination of regulatory non-compliance or a failure to cure any defect noted in an inspection report may result in reputational damage, fines, the revocation or suspension of the registration of any facility or a decrease in, or cessation of, the services provided at any given location.
 Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007. The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007 provides liability if the way in which a provider’s activities are managed or organized causes a person’s death and amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed to the deceased person.
 Regulatory and Enforcement Bodies in the U.K.
 The primary healthcare regulatory enforcement bodies in the U.K. are NHS Improvement, the CQC, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (“HIW”), Care Inspectorate Wales (“CIW”), Healthcare Improvement Scotland (“HIS”), Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (“SCSWIS”) and Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (“RQIA”). In addition, the Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (“OFSTED”), Estyn, Education Scotland and other regulatory bodies regulate and inspect education services in England, Wales and Scotland, as applicable. These enforcement bodies control and administer the registration, inspection and complaints procedures set out under the applicable laws and regulations. The enforcement bodies have the power to terminate a facility’s registration, refuse to register a facility, impose admissions holds, or impose significant fines if a service provider fails to meet the key minimum standards and requirements prescribed under the various laws and regulations. In addition, NHS Counter Fraud Authority (“CFA”) regulations apply to service providers which hold material contracts with the NHS, and they must submit an annual self-assessment of compliance against a number of standards aimed at fraud detection, prevention and reporting. The NHS CFA is a Special Health Authority, charged with identifying, investigating and preventing fraud within both public and private health bodies. See “Risk Factors— If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.”

Our primary regulators continually review their regulatory regimes and may extend their enforcement powers with the intention of holding parent companies and senior executives accountable for material breaches of regulations depending on the circumstances. Additionally, there are other regulators in the U.K. who may take enforcement action against us, including (i) the Health and Safety Executive (“HSE”) for violations of the Health and Safety at Work Act in connection with patient incidents at our facilities; (ii) the Information Commissioners Office (“ICO”) for breaches of data protection legislation (and following the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulations (the “GDPR”) which became effective in May 2018, fines for material breaches may be as high as 4% of global turnover); and (iii) Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) who in November 2017 established the Social Care Compliance Scheme (the “SCCS”) for social care providers in the U.K. with the aim of addressing the issue of potential underpayments of the National Minimum Wage (“NMW”) to workers who are paid a fixed allowance to undertake “sleep-in shifts” at care homes and other facilities at night. See “—Our operating costs are subject to increases, including due to statutorily mandated increases in the wages and salaries of our staff” for further details on U.K. staffing risks to which we are subject.
 NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement now incorporates Monitor, the former economic regulator for the NHS in England. NHS Improvement is responsible for regulating the market for NHS funded services in England. It fulfills this role through licensing NHS Foundation Trusts and certain other healthcare providers and, together with the NHS England, sets the Tariff Rules for national and local pricing of NHS services. NHS Improvement’s role is to oversee the NHS healthcare market, at all times protecting and promoting patients’ interests, tackling abuses by commissioners and/or providers and dealing with unjustifiable restrictions on competition.
 The CQC. The CQC is the independent regulator for health and adult social care in England. The CQC is distinct from NHS Improvement in that it focuses on quality and ensuring the maintenance of standards in health and social care practices. The CQC licenses NHS and adult social care service providers to enable it to keep a check on safety and quality standards. The CQC also carries out facility inspections. Care homes for young adults (including specialist college accommodation) are registered and inspected by the CQC. In addition, the CQC is responsible for monitoring the financial viability of corporate providers of adult social care.
 HIW. HIW is the independent inspectorate and regulator of all health care in Wales. Certain independent healthcare services are required to register with HIW. HIW also inspects NHS and independent healthcare organizations in Wales to ensure compliance with its and the NHS’s standards, policies, guidance and regulations. The HIW Review Service for Mental Health monitors the use of the Mental Health Act 1983 to ensure that it is being used properly on behalf of Welsh Ministers.
 CIW. Social care and social services in Wales are regulated by the CIW. CIW carries out unannounced inspections and measure against regulations. Children’s homes in Wales are inspected by CIW.
 HIS. HIS is the independent regulator for healthcare services in Scotland. HIS inspects healthcare providers in Scotland to ensure compliance with its standards, policies, guidance and regulations.
 SCSWIS. Care services in Scotland are regulated by the Care Inspectorate Scotland (also known as SCSWIS) and all care services in Scotland must be registered with them. As well as registration, SCSWIS inspects services against the National Care Standards and they can take action to force services to improve and can close services if necessary. Independent schools with boarding facilities must register their boarding provision with SCSWIS for the regulation of care as a school care accommodation service.
 RQIA. In Northern Ireland, RQIA is Northern Ireland’s independent health and social care regulator. RQIA is responsible for registering, inspecting and encouraging improvement in a range of health and social care services in accordance with the Health and Personal Social Services (Quality, Improvement and Regulation) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 and its supporting regulations. RQIA inspections are based on certain minimum care standards.
 OFSTED. OFSTED was established under the Education (Schools) Act of 1992 and regulates and inspects services in England that care for children and young people, and services providing education and skills for learners of all ages. OFSTED carries out routine day school and further education college inspections to ensure compliance with inspection frameworks.
 Estyn. In Wales, Estyn is led by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education and Training and inspects quality standards in all education provisions in Wales including children’s homes, independent and residential schools and colleges.
 Education Scotland. In Scotland, the education provision for independent schools with boarding facilities is regulated by Education Scotland.

Risk Management and Insurance
 The healthcare industry in general continues to experience an increase in the frequency and severity of litigation and claims. As is typical in the healthcare industry, we could be subject to claims that our services have resulted in injury to our patients or clients or other adverse effects. In addition, resident, visitor and employee injuries could also subject us to the risk of litigation. While management believes that quality care is provided to patients and clients in our facilities and that we materially comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, an adverse determination in a legal proceeding or government investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Our statutory workers’ compensation program is fully insured with a $0.5 million deductible per accident. A portion of the Company’s professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. We are self-insured for professional liability claims up to $3.0 million per claim and have obtained reinsurance coverage from a third party to cover claims in excess of the retention limit. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $75.0 million in the aggregate. The Company’s reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place.
 Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that: (i) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our facilities, the identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as the removal of such materials, the presence of other hazardous substances in the indoor environment, and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with the development or construction of our facilities; (ii) impose liability for costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances; and (iii) regulate workplace safety. Some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of our patients. The management of infectious medical waste is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, which establish management requirements for such waste. These requirements include record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the disposal of medical waste. The use of such companies, however, does not completely protect us from violations of medical waste laws or from related third-party claims for clean-up costs.
 From time to time, our operations have resulted in, or may result in, non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, environmental or health and safety laws or regulations. Management believes that our operations are generally in compliance with environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements or that any non-compliance will not result in a material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations at our facilities have not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with any new or changes in existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or new or discovered environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 We have not been notified of and management is otherwise currently not aware of any contamination at our currently or formerly operated facilities that could result in material liability or cost to us under environmental laws or regulations for the investigation and remediation of such contamination, and we currently are not undertaking any remediation or investigation activities in connection with any such contamination conditions. There may, however, be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 New laws, regulations or policies or changes in existing laws, regulations or policies or their enforcement, future spills or accidents or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may give rise to investigation and remediation liabilities, compliance costs, fines and penalties, or liability and claims for alleged personal injury or property damage due to substances or materials used in our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Competition
 The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors include other behavioral healthcare service companies, including UHS, private equity firms, and the NHS in the U.K. We also compete against hospitals and general healthcare facilities that provide mental health services. An important part of our business strategy is to continue making targeted acquisitions of other behavioral health facilities. However, reduced capacity, the passage of mental health parity legislation and increased demand for mental health services are likely to attract other potential buyers, including diversified healthcare companies and possibly other pure-play behavioral healthcare companies.

The mental health services sector in the U.K. comprises hospitals or establishments that provide psychiatric treatment for illness or mental disorder at all security and treatment levels. We operate in several highly competitive markets in the U.K. with a variety of for-profit, the NHS and other not-for-profit groups in each of our markets. Most competition is regional or local, based on relevant catchment areas and procurement initiatives. The NHS is often the dominant provider, although the trend has been towards increased outsourcing, whereby the NHS is both a provider and customer of mental healthcare services. NHS in-house beds accounts for approximately 70% of the total mental health hospital beds providing care in the U.K., with independent providers accounting for the remaining approximately 30% of beds.
 In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete for patients. Patients are referred to our behavioral healthcare facilities through a number of different sources, including healthcare practitioners, public programs, other treatment facilities, managed care organizations, unions, emergency departments, judicial officials, social workers, police departments and word of mouth from previously treated patients and their families, among others. These referral sources may instead refer patients to hospitals that are able to provide a full suite of medical services or to other behavioral healthcare centers.
 Employees
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 42,100 employees (approximately 20,800 in the U.S. and approximately 21,300 in the U.K), of which 28,600 were employed full-time. At December 31, 2018, labor unions represented approximately 460 of our U.S. employees at five of our U.S. facilities through eight collective bargaining agreements. Organizing activities by labor unions and certain potential changes in federal labor laws and regulations could increase the likelihood of employee unionization in the future. The Royal College of Nursing is the trade union for full and part-time nurses, nursing cadets and healthcare assistants in the U.K.
 Typically, our inpatient facilities are staffed by a chief executive officer, medical director, director of nursing, chief financial officer, clinical director and director of performance improvement. Psychiatrists and other physicians working in our facilities are licensed medical professionals who are generally not employed by us and work in our facilities as independent contractors or medical staff members.
 Seasonality of Demand for Services
 Our residential recovery and other inpatient facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the holidays, and our child and adolescent facilities typically experience lower patient volumes and revenue during the summer months, holidays and other periods when school is out of session.
