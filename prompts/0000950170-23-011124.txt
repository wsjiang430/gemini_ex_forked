Item 1. Business
Our Company

We are building the first space-based Cellular Broadband network designed to be accessible by standard, unmodified, off-the-shelf mobile phones or 2G/3G/4G LTE/5G devices using low band and middle band spectrum controlled by Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”). Our SpaceMobile Service is being designed to provide cost-effective, high-speed mobile broadband services to end-users who are out of terrestrial cellular coverage. The SpaceMobile Service currently is planned to be provided by a constellation of high-powered, large phased-array satellites in Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”). The mobile traffic will be transmitted by the SpaceMobile constellation and connected via high-throughput Q/V-band links to in-country gateways which are collocated with the MNOs’ cellular network infrastructure. We anticipate that users will be able to connect to the SpaceMobile Service as if they were using a local cell tower.
 
We intend to work with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service directly to the MNOs’ end-user customers. Our vision is that users will not need to subscribe to the SpaceMobile Service through us, nor will they need to purchase any new or additional equipment. Instead, users will be able to access the SpaceMobile Service when prompted on their mobile device that they are no longer within range of the land-based facilities of the MNO operator or will be able to purchase a plan directly with their existing mobile provider. We generally seek to use a revenue-sharing business model in our agreements with MNOs.

We believe the SpaceMobile Service will be highly attractive to MNOs as it will enable them to improve their service offering without significant incremental capital investments. The SpaceMobile Service is expected to enable MNOs to augment and extend their coverage without building towers or other land-based infrastructure, including where it is not cost-justified or is difficult due to geographical challenges, such as mountainous or rugged terrain. As a result of the incremental coverage created by the planned SpaceMobile Service, we believe that our MNO partners will have the opportunity to increase subscribers’ average revenue per unit (“ARPU”) and help to reduce subscriber churn.

On April 1, 2019, we launched our first test satellite, BlueWalker 1 (“BW1”), which was used to validate our satellite to cellular architecture and was capable of managing communications delays from LEO and the effects of doppler in a satellite to ground cellular environment using the 4G LTE protocols.
 
We launched our BlueWalker 3 (“BW3”) test satellite on September 10, 2022. On November 14, 2022, we announced the completion of the deployment of the communication array of the BW3 test satellite in orbit. On December 14, 2022, we provided an update with respect to certain BW3 test satellite performance and testing activities, including the construction of a telemetry, tracking and control network, implementation of an end-to-end testing of the flight control software to control communications array, testing patented doppler and delay hardware and software solutions, and the installation of a ground network for end-to-end testing at various testing locations.

As of March 31, 2023, we are continuing the initial testing in efforts to achieve Cellular Broadband communications between the BW3 test satellite and a standard/unmodified cellular phone. Following the completion of initial testing and after we have achieved Cellular Broadband communications, we plan to continue performing similar tests of these Cellular Broadband speeds with various MNOs internationally using the BW3 test satellite and a standard/unmodified cellular phone as well as other aspects of the SpaceMobile network.
 
We operate from multiple locations that include our corporate headquarters and 185,000 square feet satellite assembly, integrating and testing (“AIT”) facilities in Texas, and AIT and engineering and development locations elsewhere in the United States, India, Scotland, Spain and Israel. In December 2022, we established a new research and development center in India to support our global engineering and development activities. Our India research, development and engineering center will focus on research and development of next-generation hardware, software, space-related technologies and operations.

Competitive Advantage
 
We believe our planned SpaceMobile Service will have the following competitive advantages:
 
Large Addressable Market: We estimate that the annual global market opportunity for wireless cellular services is more than $1.1 trillion, according to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”) market data. As of December 31, 2022, GSMA reports approximately 5.5 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.5 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 400.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage.



Superior Interoperability and Service Quality: Due to the combination of our innovative technology and the location of our LEO satellites, we believe that our SpaceMobile Service will have significant advantages versus other mobile satellite services. The SpaceMobile Service is designed to provide connectivity to any standard, unmodified, off-the-shelf 2G/3G/4G LTE/5G mobile phone using low and mid band cellular frequencies currently used by MNOs. This technology eliminates the need to purchase expensive, specialized equipment or to carry antennas. Furthermore, our communications array, which is currently the largest ever commercially deployed in LEO, is specifically designed to deliver Cellular Broadband speeds including voice, text, data and video services.
 
Significant Coverage Advantages: We believe wireless carriers and wireless infrastructure providers will integrate our Cellular Broadband coverage capabilities in order to more cost effectively deliver wireless services in hard to reach remote areas that experience coverage gaps and in rural areas which are prohibitively expensive to cover. We also believe our SpaceMobile Service will enable wireless operators to reduce carbon emissions by enabling them to reduce the use of wireless infrastructure that uses distributed generators to power their infrastructure. In addition, we believe the SpaceMobile Service could be used as a back up in the event of a disruption of service to the MNO’s terrestrial infrastructure due to a natural disaster such as a hurricane, civil unrest or a cyberattack.
 
Satellites Designed for Greater Functionality, Power and Redundancy. The SpaceMobile satellites are designed to use patented, high-throughput modular satellite technology to distribute the functional capabilities of conventional satellites (power, thermal, navigation, communications) across many small, functionally independent and patented modules called Microns. The distribution of functionality across a large-area, low-volume and in-space structure maximizes surface area thereby materially enhancing the signal strength of the radio function while minimizing the total system mass. Another unique design feature is the attachment of solar arrays on the solar side of the array which eliminates the need for duplicative infrastructure. The distributed design is also expected to enable the SpaceMobile Service to be able to continue operations when a portion of the Microns or solar panels fail in space versus total loss which typically occurs on a conventional satellite.
 

Our Strategy
 
We intend to build a SpaceMobile Service which leverages our technology to provide Cellular Broadband services to MNO end-user customers around the world using existing mobile handsets. The principle components of our strategy include the following:
 
Develop Complementary Relationships with Mobile Network Operators. We intend on partnering with MNOs to offer the SpaceMobile Service to their end-user customers. We believe the strategy will enable our MNO partners to expand the coverage areas of their operations and increase their total addressable market with limited incremental capital investment.

Focus on Providing Wholesale Services to Mobile Network Operators. In addition to seeking complementary relationships with MNOs, we will also seek to sell our services on a wholesale basis to MNOs who then offer this capability directly to their customer base. We believe this focus will enable us to avoid competing with existing incumbent carriers and reduce the complexity of our operations, thereby significantly reducing our overhead, marketing costs, customer acquisition costs, billing infrastructure and other customer support operations.

Modular Deployment Schedule. We plan to construct and launch satellites in phases to focus our constellation’s initial power and capacity on targeted geographical areas that provide the most attractive opportunities. This prioritization of coverage is designed to minimize the capital required to initiate commercial service and generate revenue sooner. Focusing on targeted geographical areas will also enable us to concentrate our resources on fewer regulatory and ground infrastructure initiatives.
 
Continuing to Build and Leverage Relationships with Wireless Infrastructure Providers. We have entered into agreements with wireless infrastructure partners and intend to leverage these relationships to provide the in-country ground infrastructure and telecom facilities necessary for our MNO partners to deliver the SpaceMobile Service to their customers. We also believe that these wireless infrastructure providers will assist us in developing innovative financing techniques to support our infrastructure roll out and help us identify and partner with MNOs around the world.
 
Maintaining our Focus on Technology and Innovation. We continue to focus on research and development to bring our SpaceMobile Service to market. Our continued innovation in the development of our satellite system, components and related technologies and services are supported by a global engineering team of space scientists and consultants. We are also industrializing our component manufacturing and satellite assembly process to automate the assembly, installation and testing of satellites. We are also investing in scaling our procurement and inventory management processes which are expected to lower cost and increase the production volume of satellites. We protect our innovations by filing numerous patent applications and intellectual property registrations in the United States (“U.S.”) and worldwide. We own most of the intellectual property we use. We also systematically monitor and review potential infringements on our intellectual property.
 
Focus on United States Manufacturing and Intellectual Property Development Activities. Our strategy is to manufacture, assemble, integrate and test our satellites primarily in our facilities in the United States. Our development of intellectual property portfolio and flight software are driven by our engineering and development centers in the United States. We intend upon continuing to expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio and register these patents in the United States.
 
Development and Commercial Launch Activities
 
As part of our strategy, we are designing and assembling our own constellation of BlueBird (“BB”) satellites. We plan to leverage skills, know-how and technological expertise derived from the design and assembly of our BW3 test satellite in the development of our BB satellite platform. We are currently assembling the first generation of commercial BB satellites (“Block 1 BB satellites”). We expect the Block 1 BB satellites will be of similar size and weight to the BW3 test satellite and have design improvements for enhanced power efficiency and throughput designed to increase capacity. We currently expect to launch five Block 1 BB satellites during the first quarter of 2024. The exact timing of the launch is contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of assembly and testing of five Block 1 BB satellites and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Following the launch, deployment and testing of five Block 1 BB satellites, we currently plan to initiate a limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile Service in certain targeted geographical areas and seek to generate revenue from such service. Prior to initiating such service, we will need to obtain regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where we would provide such service and would need to enter into definitive agreements with MNOs relating to the offering of such service in each jurisdiction.

We believe the deployment of Block 1 BB satellites and subsequent initiation of limited, noncontinuous SpaceMobile service will help to demonstrate the advantages of a satellite-based Cellular Broadband service in the marketplace. This market activity may commence while we continue the development and testing of the next generation of the BB satellites, although there can be no guarantee that we will commence such activities.


Our next generation of BB satellites (“Block 2 BB satellites”) are expected to derive greater performance through the introduction of our own AST5000 Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) chip, which will provide materially greater throughput capacity, require less power and offer a lower overall unit cost. Block 2 BB satellites will also benefit from the advantages of a larger aperture array which provides greater spectrum reuse, enhanced signal strength and increased capacity, thereby reducing the necessary number of satellites to achieve service as compared to smaller apertures. We currently plan to launch and deploy Block 2 BB satellites in a phased approach beginning in 2024 after the launch of the Block 1 BB satellites.

We are developing a phased satellite deployment plan and corresponding commercial launch plan of the SpaceMobile Service based on targeted geographical areas to provide the SpaceMobile Service to the most commercially attractive MNO markets. We plan to achieve substantial service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve substantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB satellites. We anticipate launching and deploying additional satellites beyond the initial 95 satellites in order to enhance coverage and system capacity in response to incremental market demand. Continuous coverage is not expected to be available at all times in certain areas due to numerous factors, including number of active satellites in the region, latitude coverage range, and other factors. The timeline for the development and commercialization of our BB satellites has been, and continues to be, subject to numerous uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including, satisfactory and timely completion of satellite components and assembly and testing of the satellites, availability of launch windows by the launch providers, our ability to raise capital, proposed orbits and resulting satellite coverage, launch costs, ability to enter into definitive agreements with MNOs, regulatory approvals, and other factors. Accordingly, we may adopt a deployment and commercialization strategy, including the nature and type of services offered and the geographic areas where we may launch such services, that may differ materially from our previous and/or current plans. Also, we will need to obtain regulatory approval in each jurisdiction to provide the SpaceMobile Services and our inability to obtain such approval on a timely basis, or at all, could impact our commercial launch plans.
 
Customers, Sales and Marketing
 
We have developed relationships with companies, such as Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Nokia and others that have innovative technologies and products, skilled personnel, and potential end-user customers that complement our strategy. We believe that our business model is attractive to MNOs who will be able to augment and extend their Cellular Broadband coverage to customers without having to build additional towers, infrastructure, or purchase additional spectrum. In addition, we believe that the SpaceMobile Service will provide MNOs the opportunity to increase monthly ARPU through the sales of additional services.

The SpaceMobile Service is being designed to offer Cellular Broadband under our wholesale business model with MNOs. We expect the MNOs will market our SpaceMobile Service to their existing customers, who will be the ultimate end-users. We generally seek to negotiate a revenue-sharing model in our agreements with MNOs. As of March 31, 2023, we have entered into over 35 preliminary agreements and understandings with MNOs. Many of these preliminary agreements and understandings will need to be renewed as their terms will end before we expect to launch the SpaceMobile Service. Also, we will need to execute definitive commercial agreements with MNOs that will supersede these preliminary agreements and understandings before we can offer our SpaceMobile Service.
 


We expect that the MNOs will market and sell the enhanced coverage of the SpaceMobile Service directly to their customers and offer the service at a differentiated price to the current terrestrial coverage using the following illustrative service offerings, among others.
 

Service Offering | Service Offering Details
Day Pass (Ad-Hoc) | ● | Upon leaving the terrestrial cellular coverage area, mobile subscribers will receive a text on their phone asking if they would like to turn on the SpaceMobile Service.
Monthly Add-on Subscription (Consumer) | ● | Subscribers can pay a fixed monthly fee to add the SpaceMobile Service as a supplemental service to their current wireless plan. 
 | ● | Roaming onto the SpaceMobile Service’s network upon entering an area without cell tower coverage. 
Monthly Add-on Subscription (Enterprise) | ● | Same as monthly add-on for consumers, but with more data targeting commercial enterprises. 
Standalone Get Connected Plan | ● | In areas without cellular coverage today, subscribers will use and pay for the SpaceMobile Service as their primary network through an MNO partner. 
Aeronautical and Maritime | ● | Connect end users travelling in aircraft and vessels for Cellular Broadband service. 
Military and Government | ● | Service for military and governmental operations 

 
We expect that the majority of our revenue will be generated from SpaceMobile Service offerings similar to those described above through revenue-sharing arrangements with MNOs; however, the ultimate offerings and pricing will be subject to mutual agreement with the MNOs and there can be no assurance as to what model any MNO ultimately offers its customers and the level of customer acceptance of these models.
 
Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch
 
Our strategy is to manufacture satellite components and assemble, integrate and test BB satellites primarily in our AIT facilities in Texas. Our primary AIT facilities include approximately 185,000 square feet facilities in Texas for assembly and testing of our BB satellites, as well as an approximately 10,500 square foot facility in Spain for assembly and testing of avionics components and an approximately 33,000 square foot facility in Israel for assembly and testing of electronic components. We made significant capital investments in buildings and equipment at our AIT facilities to manufacture certain satellite components at our facilities; streamline the assembly, integration and testing processes for BB satellites; and conduct various testing of satellites including vibration and environment testing at our facilities. We currently have the capacity to produce up to two satellites per month, if required. Our goal is to continue to make additional capital investments to be able to produce up to six satellites per month to meet our future commercial launch and planned deployment strategy.

We also utilize a range of domestic and international contract manufacturers and vendors to manufacture specific components, subsystems, software and other electronic components used in our BB satellites. Some components, subsystems and services necessary for the assembly of our satellites are obtained from a sole source supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have entered into agreements and placed orders for procurement of critical and long lead components and subsystems required for the assembly of Block 1 BB satellites. In addition, we have also entered into agreements for design and development of various critical and long lead components and subsystems for Block 2 BB satellites.

We have entered into a Launch Services Agreement with SpaceX relating to the launch of the five Block 1 BB satellites. The exact timing of the launch, which is expected to carry five Block 1 BB satellites, is contingent on a number of factors, including satisfactory and timely completion of production and testing of Block 1 BB satellites and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We are also actively engaged in discussions with several launch providers for launch of our Block 2 BB satellites.

Satellite Technology Development
 
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements and continuing developments in the communications and networking environment area. We believe our ability to adapt to these changes, and to develop the SpaceMobile Service and the related components, will be an important factor in our ability to execute our business plan.

We conduct a majority of our engineering development activities by utilizing our global engineering team of space scientists and consultants to work with us on various aspects of our satellite system development efforts. Our engineering development activities

primarily take place at development offices located in Maryland, Scotland, Spain and Israel as well as at our Texas assembly and testing facilities. In December 2022, we established a new research and development center in India to support our global engineering and development activities. Our India research, development and engineering center will focus on research and development of next-generation hardware, software, space-related technologies and operations. In addition, we utilize third-party technology partners to assist in the development of our satellite technology, including our satellite mechanical design and the design of our electronics.

Government Regulations
 
We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with our services. As we launch service to additional countries and regions, we will become subject to additional governmental approvals and regulations. We will provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. Satellites must be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, which require the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum.
 
Our business is subject to extensive rules, regulations, statutes, orders and policies imposed by the government in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. For example, in the U.S. commercial use of radio-frequency spectrum is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. The FCC is responsible for authorizing the operation of commercial spacecraft, and also authorizes non-U.S. licensed spacecraft to be used to serve the United States. The FCC also licenses the operation of satellite earth stations and regulates the technical and other aspects of the operation of these facilities.
 
The SpaceMobile Service in the United States is subject to a pending Petition for Declaration and accompanying application (“PDR Application”) before the FCC, seeking market access to permit the commercial operation of a foreign satellite in United States territory in V-band frequencies. The PDR Application seeks authority to utilize 243 satellites operating in 16 orbital planes in an approximate altitude of 700 kilometers. The PDR Application for satellite space station authorization has been accepted for filing and is under consideration by the FCC. Third parties have filed letters of support for, and of opposition to, our PDR Application. We expect that, if approved, the FCC will apply routine conditions to a grant of authority authorizing market access pursuant to our PDR, including launch and operation milestones, that we must comply with. If we change the operational parameters of our satellites, we will need to file a supplemental application to modify our license with the FCC and obtain affirmative consent before undertaking such modifications. If we do not meet the launch and operation milestones set out in our grant, once obtained, we risk losing a portion of our surety bond for failure to meet all milestones.

Because the SpaceMobile Service will communicate with end users using satellites transmitting on spectrum traditionally licensed to MNOs, in the U.S. we also will need the approval of the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, which handles terrestrial wireless licensing. We intend to seek this approval in connection with an agreement with a terrestrial MNO with which we have a cooperative arrangement. Other parties have indicated that they may oppose this approval on procedural and substantive grounds.
 
We have an experimental license with the FCC that permits the testing of the BW3 test satellite in LTE frequencies in multiple locations in the United States and permits the testing of V-band ground stations in Texas and Hawaii in connection therewith. We are required to comply with operational and coordination requirements set forth as conditions to the experimental license grant. Material changes to the experimental license testing parameters would require prior approval by the FCC.
 
We also will need to secure FCC authority in the future for the ground segment of the SpaceMobile Service, consisting of approximately three fixed earth stations located in the United States. Earth station licenses generally are granted for 15-year terms, and typically are renewed in the ordinary course. Material changes in earth station operations would require prior approval by the FCC. The operation of our earth stations is subject to various license conditions, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations.
 
We are also seeking regulatory approval for fixed earth stations in other jurisdictions around the world to operate satellite earth stations in connection with our service, including in connection with BW3 testing. Also, we are seeking regulatory approval to permit the commercial operation of our satellites using V-band frequencies in foreign jurisdictions where we intend to operate. If we are unable to obtain such regulatory approvals, we would not be able to operate in those jurisdictions. With respect to the BW3 test satellite, we have contracted with third parties to permit the usage of UHF and S-band frequencies for telemetry, tracking and control (“TT&C”) in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We intend to contract with third parties for the usage of UHF and S-band frequencies in jurisdictions outside of the United States in connection with the commercial operation of the SpaceMobile Service.



The SpaceMobile Service will also operate under filings made by Papua New Guinea with the ITU and Papua New Guinea has issued a Radiocommunications Apparatus License to us to operate our satellite system. The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the ITU’s regulations, including its frequency registration and coordination procedures, and its various provisions on spectrum usage. Those procedures are specified in the ITU Radio Regulations and seek to facilitate shared international use of limited spectrum and orbital resources in a manner that avoids harmful interference. Among other things, the ITU regulations set forth procedures for establishing international priority with respect to the use of such resources, deadlines for bringing satellite networks into use in order to maintain such priority, and coordination rights and obligations with respect to other networks, which vary depending on whether such networks have higher or lower ITU priority. Further licensing by Papua New Guinea may be required if material changes to the SpaceMobile Service are made. We expect to continue to register each of our satellites after launch with the United Nations Register of Objects Launched Into Outer Space via a European country where we have operations.

Government regulators, including the FCC, have adopted expansive views of the scope of their regulatory authority over common carriers providing Cellular Broadband and are increasingly focused on the quality of service, customer disclosures, customer privacy, and the customer support that wireless carriers provide. These include, but are not limited to, common carrier obligations; universal service obligations; rules governing billing and the pass through of third party charges, regulations governing subscriber privacy and customer proprietary network information; access to E911 and location accuracy requirements; roaming obligations; rules that require wireless service providers to configure their networks to facilitate electronic surveillance by law enforcement officials; emergency warning requirements; rules governing spam, telemarketing and truth-in-billing; outage reporting; open Internet and Net neutrality requirements; cybersecurity and rules requiring the offering of equipment and services that are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, among others. Although we do not currently expect that SpaceMobile will be subject to common carrier obligations and regulations, SpaceMobile’s MNO partners may be subject to the conditions described above.
 
On March 16, 2023, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on a new regulatory framework for Supplemental Coverage from Space (“SCS”), which would allow satellite operators to collaborate with terrestrial service providers to expand coverage to terrestrial licensee subscribers. Comments will be due 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. If approved in its current form with some modifications, we believe that it will create a favorable regulatory framework for the satellite-to-device services industry.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio is expansive and technologically diverse, containing numerous and various innovations of the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth. Our IP portfolio consists of 32 patent families worldwide. To date, we have secured 15 granted United States patents, one of which is exclusively licensed to us, and at least 7 United States patent applications that have been indicated as allowable and ready for issue pending completion of patent office formalities. We also have approximately 24 currently pending United States patent applications. Moreover, we have secured 7 granted international patents providing protection in 15 different countries, including Europe, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and 2 patent applications in Australia and South Korea that have been indicated as allowable and ready for issue pending completion of patent office formalities. We have approximately 62 pending international patent applications in the countries noted above, Canada and India, as well as under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. In total, as of March 31, 2023, we have more than 2,600 patent and patent pending claims worldwide, of which approximately 800 have been officially granted or allowed.
 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We maintain IP infringement enforcement and defense insurance (current coverage of $7.0 million for defending infringement claims and $10.0 million to bring offensive infringement claims). We have filed or registered a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries and have a number of patent filings pending. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitors or competitive products in any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts has incredible value, the rapidly changing technology in the satellite and wireless communications industries and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees.
 
Certain of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.



The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
Competition
 
The mobile satellite services industry at-large is highly competitive but has significant barriers to entry, including the cost and difficulty associated with successfully developing, building and launching a satellite network and obtaining various governmental and regulatory approvals. In addition to cost, there is a significant amount of lead time associated with obtaining the required licenses, building and launching the satellite constellation, and developing and deploying the ground network technology. We currently face substantial competition from other service providers that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. There are also a number of competitors working to develop innovative solutions to compete in this industry, many of which are more established providers or have significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, while we view our services as largely complementary to terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks through our MNO partnerships, we also compete with them indirectly.
 
We face competition from existing service providers such as Inmarsat, Globalstar, ORBCOMM, Thuraya Telecommunications Co. and Iridium Communications that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. In the case of fixed broadband operators, a VSAT end-user terminal is used to provide service while with mobile satellite service providers a special purpose satellite phone is required. In addition, we face competition from companies developing new LEO networks such as SpaceX’s Starlink, OneWeb and Amazon’s Kuiper. In 2023, Apple introduced a new service supported by Globalstar which provides SOS Emergency Service capabilities to its latest generation iPhones. In September 2022, SpaceX and T-Mobile US announced that they plan to offer a text based service from a constellation that will be built in the future. We believe the planned SpaceMobile Service will compete with the direct to device segment of the mobile satellite service sector by providing the ability to support Cellular Broadband data rates, utilize existing unmodified handsets and operate in virtually all of the low to mid band spectrums used by MNOs today. In comparison, the recently announced mobile satellite service LEOs are designed to support low data rate applications such as SOS, texting and in some instances, voice.

We also compete with regional mobile satellite communications services in several geographic markets. In these cases, the majority of our competitors’ customers require regional, not global, mobile voice and data services, so competitors may present a viable alternative to the SpaceMobile Service. These regional competitors operate or plan to operate geostationary satellites. In some markets, we compete directly or indirectly with very small aperture terminal operators that offer communications services through private networks using very small aperture terminals or hybrid systems to target business users. We also compete indirectly with terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks and to the extent that terrestrial communications companies invest in underdeveloped areas, we may face increased competition in those areas.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety

We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, such as fuels and batteries, which may contain hazardous materials. Certain environmental laws, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment, including at third-party sites or offsite disposal locations, or those who currently own or operate (or formerly owned or operated) sites where such a release occurred. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities, private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials on, from or otherwise relating to such a property.

Also, our operation of satellites will be regulated by various jurisdictions over which our satellites will travel, as well as those jurisdictions in which we enter or return to the earth’s atmosphere and land (including through unintentional landings), though complete destructive atmosphere reentry of each satellite is anticipated. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of violations of or in connection with liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
 


Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 342 employees and consultants worldwide, which included approximately 180 employees and consultants in the U.S. and approximately 162 in other jurisdictions, primarily Scotland, Spain and Israel. We view the strength of our leadership team and our talented colleagues around the world as a critical component of our future success. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. None of our U.S. employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreement. Generally, each employee is required to sign a confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use agreement with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
We consider our talent to be very important to our operations and execution of our business strategy as well as the overall success of our business. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent, while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values. As such, we invest significant management attention, time and resources to attract, engage, develop and retain our talent. Our talent strategy focuses on our employee training and development, diversity and inclusion and the overall well-being and safety of our talent.

We have ongoing training and development programs to enable employees to further refine and develop their skills. We provide access and make training and development programs available to our employees which include technical programs, regulatory and compliance, business communications and leadership development.
 
We seek to attract a diverse population of employees by using a wide variety of recruiting platforms, such as online job portals (including portals targeted to diverse communities), recruiters, in-person job fairs, local university training and recruitment programs, and employee referrals. We encourage training and development of our employees and provide on-the-job training and online platforms. We mandate training for all our employees on topics of diversity, equity and inclusion and intend to continually reinforce our commitment to global diversity, equity and inclusion.
 
Our success depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train, develop, and maintain our employees' well-being. Our ability to hire, attract and retain employees depends on our ability to provide competitive total compensation. Our compensation and benefit packages are designed to attract and retain employees and align the employees' interests with our long-term success.

Key Wireless Infrastructure Provider Relationships
 
We have relationships with various wireless infrastructure providers. A summary of certain commercial relationships with wireless infrastructure providers is below.
 
Vodafone

We and Vodafone have agreed to enter into one or more definitive agreements for a commercial partnership that is anticipated to use the SpaceMobile Service (the “Vodafone Commercial Agreements”). In connection with the commercial agreements, we have agreed that we, our subsidiaries, and affiliates would not enter into any agreement, term sheet, or letter of intent that grants another party the rights related to the provision of mobile services in the Vodafone markets or Vodafone partner markets prior to the execution of the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.
 
The Vodafone Commercial Agreements are expected to include mutual exclusivity, conditioned upon Vodafone making the SpaceMobile Service available to all of its customers and certain promotional efforts, within all specified Vodafone markets for five years commencing on the launch of a commercial service in all of the specified Vodafone markets; preferential commercial terms in Vodafone partner markets; 50/50 revenue share for the SpaceMobile Service in Vodafone exclusivity markets; and the procurement, building and operating of mobile network ground stations at a mutually agreed cost by Vodafone. No payments have been made to date between us and Vodafone pursuant to the anticipated Vodafone Commercial Agreements. Vodafone has the right to designate one individual to our Board of Directors. Currently, Vodafone’s designee is Luke Ibbetson, Head of Group Research & Development, Vodafone.



Also, we entered into a side letter with Vodafone dated December 15, 2020, under which we have agreed (i) not to enter into any material corporate strategic relationship or material commercial agreement with a party other than Vodafone and its affiliates that would be reasonably expected to materially frustrate our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements with certain exceptions; (ii) to allocate sufficient funds in the capital budget to facilitate compliance with our obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements; and (iii) not to alter our business plan in a manner that is materially detrimental to our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Vodafone Commercial Agreements.
 
American Tower

We and American Tower have entered into a side letter agreement that was subsequently amended and restated on December 15, 2020 to reflect the transactions and agreements contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement between us and New Providence Acquisition Corp. (“NPA”) (the “Amended and Restated Letter Agreement”). The Amended and Restated Letter Agreement contemplates that we and American Tower will enter into commercial agreements to allow us to use American Tower facilities for our terrestrial gateway facilities in certain markets. The term of the operational agreement between us and American Tower is for an anticipated five years after the initial launch of commercial mobile services by us.
 
The usage of any American Tower services in a Vodafone market will be memorialized in a commercial agreement among all three parties. In markets where Vodafone does not operate (“Carrier Neutral Markets”), we and American Tower may enter into an agreement for American Tower to manage the operation of our deployed gateway facility in such market. In Carrier Neutral Markets where we require a third party to provide a gateway facility or services, we agree to not accept any bid that is inferior to American Tower’s best and final proposal for such gateway facility or services. We also agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to utilize American Tower facilities in (i) Vodafone markets where Vodafone decides to not use its facilities, (ii) in Carrier Neutral Markets, and (iii) instances where we require a third-party vendor.
 
Additionally, we will work with American Tower to evaluate and plan gateway facility and radio access network data center deployments with preferred vendor status to offer carrier-neutral hosting facilities in certain equatorial markets. American Tower will serve as the preferred vendor for carrier neutral hosting facilities. We will pay American Tower a monthly connection fee for use of a carrier neutral hosting facility, which we expect will be charged back to each applicable MNO. If we and American Tower agree to construct a new carrier neutral hosting facility or improve an existing one and American Tower elects to fund all such capital expenditures, American Tower will provide AST with a fair-market, long-term lease to such facility. No payments have been made to date between us and American Tower under the Amended and Restated Letter Agreement. American Tower has the right to designate one individual to our Board of Directors. Currently, American Tower's designee is Ed Knapp, Chief Technology Officer, American Tower.
 
On March 22, 2022, we and American Tower entered into a non-binding term sheet reflecting the terms and conditions for the deployment of our gateway satellite technology equipment on property owned and operated by American Tower. Under the agreement, American Tower will provide us leased space and managed services at its current and future tower sites and data centers under the global master lease agreements to be entered into by the parties.
 
Rakuten

On February 4, 2020, we entered into a commercial agreement with Rakuten, for our development of exclusive network capabilities in Japan compatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates, which agreement was amended and restated as of December 15, 2020 (the “Rakuten Agreement”). Under the terms of the Rakuten Agreement, we agreed to make investments in building network capabilities in Japan that are compatible with the mobile network of Rakuten and its affiliates. Furthermore, we will collaborate with Rakuten to ensure network capability with Rakuten’s licensed frequencies, including full coverage in Japan with 3GPP Band 3 frequencies with MIMO capability. Upon the launch of such coverage, Rakuten will receive unlimited, exclusive rights and usage capacity in Japan in exchange for a $0.5 million annual maintenance fee payable to us or our successors. We will make $5.0 million (or such lesser amount as mutually agreed upon the parties) in capital investments towards the design, construction, acquisition and implementation of ground communication assets. We and Rakuten will receive unlimited rights and usage of the ground assets for their respective operations, including, but not limited to, satellite and other telecommunication communications. Rakuten has the right to designate two individuals to our Board of Directors. Currently, Rakuten’s designees are Mickey Mikitani, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten, Inc., and Tareq Amin, Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten Mobile.

The Rakuten Agreement includes key performance indicators (“KPIs”) associated with the number of satellites launched, timing and coverage of our SpaceMobile Service in Japan in a phased manner that we must meet. If we do not meet the applicable KPIs for the last two phases noted in the Rakuten Agreement by June 2023 or if AST LLC becomes subject to any bankruptcy

proceeding or becomes insolvent, we are required to pay to Rakuten an amount of $10.0 million. Payment of such amount can be made by issuing a promissory note bearing interest at 8.0% per annum and payable in 12 quarterly installments over a three-year term, which can be prepaid at our election. We do not expect to meet the applicable KPIs by June 2023. We and Rakuten are in discussions in light of our current business plan, planned deployment timeline, and commercialization strategy. However, there can be no assurance that Rakuten will agree to amend or waive the $10.0 million payment that would be due for not meeting the KPIs. If Rakuten does not agree to amend or waive this $10.0 million payment, we expect to incur a liability of $10.0 million in June 2023. The term of the Rakuten Agreement shall remain in effect until we fulfill our obligations under the Rakuten Agreement. No payments have been made to date between us and Rakuten under the Rakuten Agreement.
