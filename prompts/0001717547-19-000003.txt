Item 1. Business
Our Company
References to “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context specifically requires otherwise. References to the “OP” refer to Credit RE Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the operating company of the Company. References to “Colony Capital” refers to Colony Capital, Inc. a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries.
We are a commercial real estate (“CRE”) credit real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net leased properties predominantly in the United States. We are focused on consistently providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders primarily through cash distributions and the preservation of invested capital, and secondarily through capital appreciation. The real estate credit markets continually evolve, and we believe the 27-year track record of Colony Capital and its affiliates of successfully investing across the real estate capital structure uniquely positions us to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles.
We are externally managed by a subsidiary of Colony Capital, a NYSE-listed global real estate and investment management firm with over $22 billion of total consolidated assets and over $43 billion of assets under management. Immediately upon completion of the Combination (as defined below) and related transactions, Colony Capital owned approximately 37% of our common equity on a fully diluted basis, evidencing a strong alignment of interests between Colony Capital and our stockholders.
Our Formation Transactions
On January 31, 2018, we completed a combination of a select portfolio of Colony Capital Operating Company, LLC (“CLNY OP”) assets and liabilities (the “CLNY OP Contributed Entities”), a select portfolio of assets and liabilities of NRF RED REIT Corp. (“RED REIT”), a Maryland corporation and indirect subsidiary of CLNY OP (the “RED REIT Contributed Entities”), substantially all of the assets and liabilities of NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“NorthStar I”), and all of the assets and liabilities of NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“NorthStar II”) (collectively, the “Combination”). The Combination consisted of the following steps:

• | CLNY OP, together with one or more of its subsidiaries, contributed to us and our operating company the CLNY OP Contributed Entities and the RED REIT Contributed Entities, with CLNY OP receiving approximately 44.4 million shares of the Company’s Class B-3 common stock and RED REIT receiving approximately 3.1 million common membership units in the OP (“OP Units”);


• | NorthStar I merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation (the “NorthStar I Merger”), with stockholders of NorthStar I (including Colony Capital and its affiliates) receiving approximately 42.1 million shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for outstanding shares of NorthStar I common stock as a result of the NorthStar I Merger in an all-stock transaction;


• | NorthStar II merged with and into the Company with the Company as the surviving corporation (the “NorthStar II Merger” and, together with the NorthStar I Merger, the “Mergers”), with stockholders of NorthStar II (including Colony Capital and its affiliates) receiving approximately 40.4 million shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of NorthStar II common stock as a result of the NorthStar II Merger in an all-stock transaction; and


• | We contributed to our operating company (i) the CLNY OP Contributed Entities, (ii) the equity interests of NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust Operating Partnership, LP (“NorthStar I OP”), a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of NorthStar I, and (iii) the equity interests of NorthStar Real Estate Income Operating Partnership II, LP (“NorthStar II OP”), a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of NorthStar II, and in connection with that transaction we received approximately 126.9 million OP Units.

As a result of the Combination, we assumed substantially all of the outstanding assets and liabilities of NorthStar I, all of the assets and liabilities of NorthStar II, the assets and liabilities of the CLNY OP Contributed Entities and the assets and liabilities of the RED REIT Contributed Entities. We conduct substantially all of our business through the OP. The Company owns 97.6% of the outstanding OP Units in the OP.
Our Relationship with Our Manager and Colony Capital
We are externally managed by our manager, CLNC Manager, LLC (our “Manager”). Our Manager is a subsidiary of Colony Capital and benefits from the expertise and resources of Colony Capital. Colony Capital and its predecessors have a 27-year track 
3

record and have made over $100 billion of investments. Colony Capital’s senior management team has a long track record and extensive experience managing and investing in our target assets and other real estate-related investments through a variety of credit cycles and market conditions. Colony Capital’s global footprint and corresponding network provides its investment and asset management teams with proprietary market knowledge, exceptional sourcing capabilities and the local presence required to identify, execute and manage complex transactions, although Colony Capital and its predecessors have not been immune to national and local economic trends that are unrelated to its management of assets. Colony Capital’s successful history of external management includes its previous management of Colony Financial, Inc. (“Colony Financial”), an externally managed commercial mortgage REIT listed on the NYSE and focused on secondary loan acquisitions, high-yielding originations and real estate equity, its current management of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. (“NorthStar Europe”), a publicly traded REIT listed on the NYSE and focused on European CRE with over $1 billion in assets, and its management of various non-traded REITs (previously including NorthStar I and NorthStar II) and registered investment companies with in excess of $3 billion of equity commitments.
Colony Capital is headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with over 400 employees in 17 locations in ten countries, with key offices in New York, Paris and London. Its operations are broad and diverse and include the management of real estate, both owned and on behalf of a diverse set of institutional and individual investors. Colony Capital has a highly experienced management team of diverse backgrounds with a demonstrated track record of success at asset managers and investment firms, private investment funds, investment banks and other financial service companies, which provides an enhanced perspective for managing our portfolio. Kevin P. Traenkle, a 25-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Neale W. Redington, a 10-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. In addition, supporting our business, David A. Palamé, a 12-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our General Counsel and Secretary, and Frank V. Saracino, a three-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our Chief Accounting Officer.
We draw on Colony Capital’s substantial real estate investment platform and relationships to source, underwrite, structure and manage a robust pipeline of investment opportunities as well as to access debt and equity capital to fund our operations. We believe we are able to originate, acquire, finance and manage investments with attractive in-place cash flows and the potential for meaningful capital appreciation over time. We also benefit from Colony Capital’s portfolio management, finance and administration functions, which provide us with legal, compliance, investor relations, asset valuation, risk management and information technology services. Colony Capital also has a captive, fully-functional, separate asset management company that engages primarily in loan servicing for performing, sub-performing and non-performing commercial loans, including senior secured loans, revolving lines of credit, loan participations, subordinated loans, unsecured loans and mezzanine debt. Colony Capital’s asset management company is a commercial special servicer rated by both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch’s rating services.
Our operating segments include the loan portfolio, CRE debt securities, net leased real estate, other, and corporate. Our target assets, as more fully described below, are included in different operating segments. Senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity are included in the loan portfolio segment. Refer to Note 19, “Segment Reporting” in Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” for further discussion of our operating segments.
Our Investment Strategy
Our objective is to generate consistent and attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We seek to achieve this objective primarily through cash distributions and the preservation of invested capital and secondarily through capital appreciation. We believe our diversified investment strategy across the CRE capital stack provides flexibility through economic cycles to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. This approach is driven by a disciplined investment strategy, focused on:

• | capitalizing on asset level underwriting experience and market analytics to identify investments with pricing dislocations and attractive risk-return profiles;


• | originating and structuring CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity with attractive return profiles relative to the underlying value and financial operating performance of the real estate collateral, given the strength and quality of the sponsorship;


• | identifying appropriate CRE debt securities investments based on the performance of the underlying real estate assets, the impact of such performance on the credit return profile of the investments and our expected return on the investments;


• | identifying net leased real estate investments based on property location and purpose, tenant credit quality, market lease rates and potential appreciation of, and alternative uses for, the real estate;


• | creating capital appreciation opportunities through active asset management and equity participation opportunities; and


• | structuring transactions with a prudent amount of leverage, if any, given the risk of the underlying asset’s cash flows, attempting to match the structure and duration of the financing with the underlying asset’s cash flows, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate.

The period for which we intend to hold our investments will vary depending on the type of asset, interest rates, investment performance, micro and macro real estate environment, capital markets and credit availability, among other factors. We generally expect to hold debt investments until the stated maturity and equity investments in accordance with each investment’s proposed 
4

business plan. We may sell all or a partial ownership interest in an investment before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
Our investment strategy is dynamic and flexible, enabling us to adapt to shifts in economic, real estate and capital market conditions and to exploit market inefficiencies. We may expand or change our investment strategy or target assets over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market conditions. This flexibility in our investment strategy allows us to employ a customized, solutions-oriented approach, which we believe is attractive to borrowers and tenants. We believe that our diverse portfolio, our ability to originate, acquire and manage our target assets and the flexibility of our investment strategy positions us to capitalize on market inefficiencies and generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a variety of market conditions and economic cycles.
Our Target Assets
Our investment strategy is to originate and selectively acquire our target assets, which consist of the following:

• | Senior Mortgage Loans. We focus on originating and selectively acquiring senior mortgage loans that are backed by CRE assets. These loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on a commercial property and provide mortgage financing to a commercial property developer or owner. The loans may vary in duration, bear interest at a fixed or floating rate and amortize, if at all, over varying periods, often with a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Senior mortgage loans include junior participations in our originated senior loans for which we have syndicated the senior participations to other investors and retained the junior participations for our portfolio. We believe these junior participations are more similar to the senior mortgage loans we originate than other loan types given their credit quality and risk profile.


• | Mezzanine Loans. We may originate or acquire mezzanine loans, which are structurally subordinate to senior loans, but senior to the borrower’s equity position. Mezzanine loans may be structured such that our return accrues and is added to the principal amount rather than paid on a current basis. We may also pursue equity participation opportunities in instances when the risk-reward characteristics of the investment warrant additional upside participation in the possible appreciation in value of the underlying assets securing the investment.


• | Preferred Equity. We may make investments that are subordinate to senior and mezzanine loans, but senior to the common equity in the mortgage borrower. Preferred equity investments may be structured such that our return accrues and is added to the principal amount rather than paid on a current basis. We also may pursue equity participation opportunities in preferred equity investments, similar to such participations in mezzanine loans.


• | CRE Debt Securities. We may make investments that consist of bonds comprising certain tranches of CRE securitization pools, such as commercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”) (including “B-pieces” of a CMBS securitization pool) or CRE collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) (collateralized by pools of CRE debt instruments). These bonds may be investment grade or below investment grade and are collateralized by CRE debt, typically secured by senior mortgage loans and may be fixed rate or floating rate securities. Due to their first-loss position, CMBS B-pieces are typically offered at a discount to par. These investments typically carry a 10-year weighted average life due to prepayment restrictions. We generally intend to hold these investments through maturity, but may, from time to time, opportunistically sell positions should liquidity become available or be required.


• | Net Leased Real Estate. We may also invest directly in well-located commercial real estate with long-term leases to tenants on a net lease basis, where such tenants generally will be responsible for property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, maintenance capital expenditures and real estate taxes. In addition, tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), (2) fixed increases, or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term, net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.

The allocation of our capital among our target assets will depend on prevailing market conditions at the time we invest and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions. In addition, in the future, we may invest in assets other than our target assets or change our target assets. With respect to all of our investments, we invest so as to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our exclusion or exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).
We believe that events in the financial markets from time to time have created and will create significant dislocation between price and intrinsic value in certain asset classes as well as a supply and demand imbalance of available credit to finance these assets. We believe that the Company is well positioned to capitalize on such opportunities while remaining flexible to adapt our strategy as market conditions change, including with respect to existing investments that may be directly or indirectly impacted 
5

by such events. We believe that our Manager’s in-depth understanding of CRE and real estate-related investments, and in-house underwriting, asset management and resolution capabilities, provides the Company and management with a sophisticated full-service value-add platform to regularly evaluate our investments and determine primary, secondary or alternative disposition strategies. This includes intermediate servicing and complex and creative negotiating, restructuring of non-performing investments, foreclosure considerations, intense management or development of owned real estate, in each case to reposition and achieve optimal value realization for the Company and its stockholders. Depending on the nature of the underlying investment, we may pursue repositioning strategies through judicious capital investment in order to extract maximum value from the investment or recognize unanticipated losses to reinvest resulting liquidity in higher-yielding performing investments.
 Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 160 investments representing approximately $8.4 billion in book value (excluding cash, cash equivalents and certain other assets). Our loan portfolio consisted of 76 senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments and had a weighted average cash coupon of 6.6% and a weighted average all-in unlevered yield of 8.3%. Our CRE debt securities portfolio had a weighted average cash coupon of 3.8%. Our owned real estate portfolio (including net lease and other real estate) consisted of approximately 16.1 million total square feet of space and the total annualized base rent of that portfolio was approximately $135.0 million (based on leases in place as of December 31, 2018).

Underwriting Process
We use a rigorous investment and underwriting process that has been developed and utilized by our Manager’s and its affiliates’ senior management teams leveraging their extensive commercial real estate expertise over many years and real estate cycles. The underwriting process focuses on some or all of the following factors designed to ensure each investment is evaluated appropriately: (i) macroeconomic conditions that may influence operating performance; (ii) fundamental analysis of underlying real estate, including tenant rosters, lease terms, zoning, necessary licensing, operating costs and the asset’s overall competitive position in its market; (iii) real estate market factors that may influence the economic performance of the investment, including leasing conditions and overall competition; (iv) the operating expertise and financial strength and reputation of a tenant, operator, partner or borrower; (v) the cash flow in place and projected to be in place over the term of the investment and potential return; (vi) the appropriateness of the business plan and estimated costs associated with tenant buildout, repositioning or capital improvements; (vii) an internal and third-party valuation of a property, investment basis relative to the competitive set and the ability to liquidate an investment through a sale or refinancing; (viii) review of third-party reports including appraisals, engineering and environmental reports; (ix) physical inspections of properties and markets; (x) the overall legal structure of the investment, contractual implications and the lenders’ rights; and (xi) the tax and accounting impact. 
The following section describes the major CRE asset classes in which we may invest and actively manage to maximize value and to protect capital.

In March 2018, the borrower on our four NY hospitality loans failed to make all required interest payments. These four loans are secured by the same collateral. We placed the loans on non-accrual status and commenced discussions with the borrower to resolve the matter. Interest income was recognized on a cash basis. During the year, we recognized $3.4 million in interest income on the loans. 
During the third quarter of 2018, discussions with the borrower did not progress as anticipated which led to us exploring additional options for resolution. We prepared a weighted average probability analysis of potential resolutions, which included a recapitalization and earlier than expected receipt and sale of collateral. Based on this analysis, we recorded a $35.1 million provision for loan loss on the four NY hospitality loans during the third quarter of 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the borrower entered into a listing agreement with a real estate brokerage firm and as a result, we believe sale of the underlying collateral and repayment of the four loans from the sales proceeds is the most likely outcome. As such, we recorded an additional $18.8 million of provision for loan loss on the four NY hospitality loans in 2018 to reflect the estimated proceeds to be received from the borrower following the sale.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was one mezzanine loan previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) with carrying value before allowance for loan losses of $28.6 million. The loan had been modified in 2015. We also have three other loans with a combined carrying value before provision for loan losses of $108.5 million that are cross-collateralized with the TDR loan to the same borrower. Two loans matured in November 2017 and were in default at both December 31, 2018 and 2017, while the third loan matured in October 2018 and was in default at December 31, 2018. All four loans are cross-collateralized with 28 office, retail, multifamily and industrial properties.
In February 2018, the borrower entered into a forbearance agreement with us to allow both parties to review the exit strategy. The forbearance agreement was terminated by us in August 2018 when it became clear that the borrower would not complete its exit strategy. We commenced foreclosure proceedings under the mezzanine loan to take control of the 28 cross-collateralized properties, which was completed in January 2019. As such, we recorded a $31.7 million provision for loan loss on the four loans to reflect the estimated fair value of the collateral. We recorded an additional $5.1 million of provision for loan loss associated with a receivable for operating expenses paid by us on the borrower’s behalf during the year ended December 31, 2018. To improve the operating performance of the 28 properties, we have engaged new property managers, working under the perpetual oversight of our asset management team. 
During the fourth quarter of 2018, two separate borrowers on three of our regional mall loans with unpaid principal balances of $29.9 million, $26.5 million, and $7.0 million, respectively, notified us of the potential loss of anchor tenants. Following this notification, we concluded that foreclosure or sale of the underlying collateral and repayment for each of these loans is the most likely outcome. As such, we recorded a provision for loan loss of $8.0 million, $8.8 million and $7.0 million respectively, to reflect the estimated fair value of the collateral. We have commenced foreclosure proceedings on two of the three loans collateralized by one of the regional malls with unpaid principal balances totaling $36.9 million. We have been and are continuing to sweep all cash from the operations of the two regional malls.

Owned Real Estate
Our operating real estate investment strategy focuses on direct ownership in commercial real estate with an emphasis on properties with stable cash flow, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner’s equity. In addition, we may own operating real estate investments through joint ventures with one or more partners. As part of our real estate properties strategy, we explore a 
10

variety of real estate investments including multi-tenant office, multifamily, student housing and industrial. These properties are typically well-located with strong operating partners and we believe offer both attractive cash flow and returns.
As of December 31, 2018, $2.1 billion, or 25.0%, of our assets were invested in real estate properties and our portfolio was 92.7% occupied. The following table presents our real estate property investments as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other CRE finance and investment companies in a number of ways, including the following:
Large diversified portfolio.
We are one of the largest publicly traded CRE credit/mortgage REITs. Our portfolio is composed of a diverse set of CRE assets across the capital stack, including senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities, net leased properties and other real estate equity investments, all of which have been underwritten and asset managed by Colony Capital (or its affiliates and predecessors). We believe that the scale of our portfolio gives us a competitive advantage by providing us with significant portfolio diversification, economies of scale and advantageous access to capital.
Nimble and differentiated investment strategy.
We focus on originating, acquiring, financing and managing CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net leased properties. Our investment strategy is dynamic and flexible, enabling us to adapt to shifts in economic, real estate and capital market conditions and to exploit market inefficiencies, as demonstrated by Colony Capital’s 27-year history. This flexible investment strategy will allow us to employ a customized, solutions-oriented approach to investment, which we believe is attractive to our borrowers and tenants and which will allow us to deploy capital across a broader opportunity set.
Relationship with Colony Capital.
We believe that our affiliation with Colony Capital, through our Manager, provides us with a number of competitive advantages, including:

• | Seasoned Management Team. Colony Capital’s highly experienced senior management team consists of real estate professionals from diverse CRE backgrounds. The Colony Capital team works seamlessly with our senior management team, which is led by Kevin P. Traenkle and Neale W. Redington. Messrs. Traenkle and Redington, as well as other members of our management team, have significant CRE experience through multiple real estate cycles and have been extensively involved in the investment and management of our predecessors’ portfolio of credit assets, including our initial portfolio.


• | Colony Capital Has a Substantial Equity Stake In Us. Colony Capital owns approximately 37% of our common equity, on a fully diluted basis, evidencing a strong alignment of interests between Colony Capital and our stockholders. As a result, Colony Capital derives a substantial amount of value from its investment in us through our stock performance and the distributions that we expect to make.


• | Extensive Sourcing Capabilities. Colony Capital has access to extensive relationships with borrowers and intermediaries, expertise in identifying, evaluating and structuring real estate investments across the capital stack in different market conditions, and real-time information on markets in which it owns and operates real estate assets. Colony Capital and its predecessors have a 27-year track record and have made over $100 billion of investments throughout economic cycles by focusing on opportunities that were often overlooked by or unavailable to other investors. This experience will help

12

us identify market trends and conditions to deploy capital successfully and provide us with access to proprietary investment opportunities.

• | Disciplined Underwriting and Asset Selection. Colony Capital’s fully integrated in-house operating platform has extensive experience underwriting, conducting due diligence and valuing real estate and real estate-related assets. The foundation of this underwriting platform is Colony Capital’s credit-oriented culture and its in-depth, asset level evaluation of each investment opportunity using rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis. We believe that these tools provide us with an advantage relative to many of our competitors and enable Colony Capital to better identify attractive investment opportunities and assess the performance, risk and returns that we should expect from any particular investment.


• | Robust Asset Management Capabilities. Colony Capital maintains best-in-class asset management and risk management capabilities. We expect Colony Capital to maximize the value of our invested capital and create potential capital appreciation opportunities through active management of our portfolio. The senior personnel of Colony Capital and its affiliates are highly experienced in loan, securities and real estate asset management, and have been successful in formulating and executing various asset management strategies through a variety of economic cycles and in complex capital structures. We are able to draw on the experience of Colony Capital’s dedicated asset management professionals, who, in collaboration with the investments team, will formulate a strategic plan to extract the maximum amount of value from each investment through, among other things, repositioning, restructuring, intensive management and, when appropriate, enforcing our rights and remedies.


• | Public Company and REIT Management Experience. Colony Capital and its predecessors have a successful track record managing publicly registered investment platforms, including Colony Financial, which was an externally managed NYSE-listed commercial mortgage REIT with an investment strategy similar to ours, focused on high-yielding loan originations and acquisitions and real estate equity before consummating a business combination and management internalization transaction with Colony Capital, LLC in April 2015. In addition, Colony Capital currently manages other publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs and registered investment companies, including NYSE-listed NorthStar Europe and previously managed NorthStar I and NorthStar II prior to the Combination. Through the management of these companies, Colony Capital has developed significant expertise in operating publicly registered companies, including public company reporting, internal controls and risk management, legal and regulatory compliance (including REIT and Investment Company Act compliance), stock exchange requirements, operations, financing and accessing the capital markets.

Our Financing Strategy 
We have a multi-pronged financing strategy that includes an up to $560 million secured revolving credit facility, up to approximately $2.1 billion in secured revolving repurchase facilities, non-recourse securitization financing, commercial mortgages and other asset-level financing structures. In addition, we may use other forms of financing, including additional warehouse facilities, public and private secured and unsecured debt issuances and equity or equity-related securities issuances by us or our subsidiaries. We may also finance a portion of our investments through the syndication of one or more interests in a whole loan or securitization. We will seek to match the nature and duration of the financing with the underlying asset’s cash flow, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate.
Leverage Policies
While we limit our use of leverage and believe we can achieve attractive yields on an unleveraged basis, we may use prudent amounts of leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders and/or to finance future investments. Given current market conditions, to the extent that we use borrowings to finance our assets, we currently expect that such leverage would not exceed on a debt-to-equity basis, a 3-to-1 ratio for us as a whole. We consider these leverage ratios to be prudent for our target asset classes. Our decision to use leverage currently or in the future to finance our assets will be based on our Manager’s assessment of a variety of factors, including, among others, the anticipated credit quality, liquidity and price volatility of the assets in our investment portfolio, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the ability to raise additional equity to reduce leverage and create liquidity for future investments, the availability of credit at favorable prices or at all, the credit quality of our assets and our outlook for borrowing costs relative to the interest income earned on our assets. Our decision to use leverage in the future to finance our assets will be at the discretion of our Manager and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders, and we are not restricted by our governing documents or otherwise in the amount of leverage that we may use. To the extent that we use leverage in the future, we may mitigate interest rate risk through utilization of hedging instruments, primarily interest rate swap and cap agreements, to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on our borrowings.

Investment Guidelines
We have no prescribed limitation on any particular investment type. However, the Company’s board of directors (“Board of Directors”) has adopted the following investment guidelines:

• | no investment shall be made that would cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


• | no investment shall be made that would cause the Company or any subsidiary to be required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;


• | until appropriate investments can be identified, the Manager may invest the proceeds of any future offerings of the Company in interest-bearing, short-term investments, including money market accounts and/or U.S. treasury securities, that are consistent with the Company’s intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act;


• | no investment shall require prior approval of the Board of Directors or a majority of the independent directors solely because such investment constitutes (1) a co-investment made by and between the Company or any subsidiary, on the one hand, and one or more investment vehicles formed, sponsored and managed by Colony Capital or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, regardless of when such co-investment is made, or (2) a transaction related to any such co-investment;


• | any investment with a total net commitment by the OP of greater than 5% of the OP’s net equity (computed using the most recently available publicly filed balance sheet) shall require the approval of the Board of Directors or a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors (with total net commitment by the OP being the aggregate amount of funds directly or indirectly committed by the OP to such investment net of any upfront fees received by the Company or any subsidiary in connection with such investment); and


• | any investment with a total net commitment by the OP of between 3% and 5% of the OP’s net equity (computed using the most recently available publicly filed balance sheet) shall require the approval of the Board of Directors or a duly constituted committee of the Board of Directors (with total net commitment by the OP being the aggregate amount of funds directly or indirectly committed by the OP to such investment net of any upfront fees received by the Company or any subsidiary in connection with such investment), unless the investment falls within specific parameters approved by the Board of Directors and in effect at the time such commitment is made.

The investment guidelines can be amended or waived with the approval of the Board of Directors (which must include a majority of the independent directors) and the Manager.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
REIT Qualification
We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2018. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the “REIT taxable income” that we distribute annually to our stockholders.
Investment Company Act Matters
We and our subsidiaries conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
We believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we do not engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we, through our subsidiaries, are primarily engaged in non-investment company businesses related to real estate. In addition, we intend to conduct our operations so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis will consist of “investment securities.” Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and that owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items). Excluded from the term “investment securities” (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act) are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are themselves not investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Under the Investment Company Act, a subsidiary is majority-owned if a company owns 50% or more of its outstanding voting securities. To avoid the need to register as an investment company, the securities issued to us by any wholly-owned or majority-
14

owned subsidiaries that we may form in the future that are excluded from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis. We monitor our holdings to ensure ongoing compliance with this test.
We hold our assets primarily through direct or indirect wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. To qualify for the exclusion pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C), based on positions set forth by the staff of the SEC, each such subsidiary generally is required to hold at least (i) 55% of its assets in “qualifying” real estate assets and (ii) at least 80% of its assets in “qualifying” real estate assets and real estate-related assets. For our subsidiaries that maintain this exclusion or another exclusion or exception under the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof), our interests in these subsidiaries do not and will not constitute “investment securities.” “Qualifying” real estate assets for this purpose include senior mortgage loans, certain B-notes and certain mezzanine loans that satisfy various conditions as set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff no-action letters and other guidance, and other assets that the SEC staff in various no-action letters and other guidance has determined are the functional equivalent of senior loans for the purposes of the Investment Company Act. We treat as real estate-related assets B-pieces and mezzanine loans that do not satisfy the conditions set forth in the relevant SEC staff no-action letters and other guidance, and debt and equity securities of companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses. Unless a relevant SEC no-action letter or other guidance applies, we expect to treat preferred equity interests as real estate-related assets. The SEC has not published guidance with respect to the treatment of CMBS for purposes of the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. Unless the SEC or its staff issues guidance with respect to CMBS, we intend to treat CMBS as a real estate-related asset. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. For our subsidiaries that maintain this exclusion or another exclusion or exception under the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof), our interests in these subsidiaries do not and will not constitute “investment securities.”
If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters.
As a consequence of our seeking to avoid the need to register under the Investment Company Act on an ongoing basis, we and/or our subsidiaries may be restricted from making certain investments or may structure investments in a manner that would be less advantageous to us than would be the case in the absence of such requirements. In particular, a change in the value of any of our assets could negatively affect our ability to avoid the need to register under the Investment Company Act and cause the need for a restructuring of our investment portfolio. For example, these restrictions may limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to invest directly in mortgage-backed securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of senior loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations and certain asset-backed securities, noncontrolling equity interests in real estate companies or in assets not related to real estate. In addition, seeking to avoid the need to register under the Investment Company Act may cause us and/or our subsidiaries to acquire or hold additional assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or held or dispose of investments that we and/or our subsidiaries might not have otherwise disposed of, which could result in higher costs or lower proceeds to us than we would have paid or received if we were not seeking to comply with such requirements. Thus, avoiding registration under the Investment Company Act may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.
There can be no assurance that we and our subsidiaries will be able to successfully avoid operating as an unregistered investment company. If it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company, and that we would be subject to limitations on corporate leverage that would have an adverse impact on our investment returns.
Government Regulation Relating to the Environment
Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations. Such laws and other regulations relate to a variety of environmental hazards, including asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”), toxins or irritants, mold, regulated substances, emissions to the environment, fire codes and other hazardous or toxic substances, materials or wastes. These laws are subject to change and may be more stringent in the future. Under current laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender if it participates in management or succeeds to ownership or control of a property) may become liable for costs and liabilities related to contamination or other environmental issues at or with respect to the property, including in connection with the activities of a tenant. Such cleanup laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, parties may be liable for costs of remediating contamination at an off-site disposal or treatment facilities where they arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances. These liabilities 
15

and costs, including for investigation, remediation or removal of those substances or natural resource damages, third party tort claims resulting from personal injury or property damage, restrictions on the manner in which the property is used, liens in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs related to cleanup of contamination, and costs to properly manage or abate asbestos or mold may be substantial. Absent participating in management or succeeding to ownership, operation or other control of real property, a secured lender is not likely to be directly subject to any of these forms of environmental liability, although a borrower could be subject to these liabilities impacting its ability to make loan payments.
Prior to closing any property acquisition, we obtain environmental assessments in a manner we believe prudent in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns with respect to such properties. These assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. We may also conduct limited subsurface investigations and test for substances of concern where the result of the first phase of the environmental assessments or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures.
We are not currently aware of any environmental liabilities that could materially affect the Company. Refer to the risk factor “Environmental compliance costs and other environmental liabilities associated with our current or former properties or our CRE debt or real estate-related investments may materially impair the value of our investments and expose us to material liability” in the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Investments” for more details regarding potential environmental liabilities and risk related to the Company.
Other Regulation
Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting activities; (2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; (5) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices; and (6) regulate affordable housing rental activities. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We are also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans and the Fair Housing Act. We intend to conduct our business so that we comply with such laws and regulations.
Competition
We are engaged in a competitive business. In our lending and investing activities, we compete for opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including funds that Colony Capital or its affiliates may in the future sponsor, advise and/or manage), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and may have similar acquisition objectives that overlap with ours. These other REITs will increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase and origination. Furthermore, this competition in our target asset classes may lead to the yields of such assets decreasing, which may further limit our ability to generate satisfactory returns. 
Some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us, such as the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT rule compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans and investments, offer more attractive pricing or other terms and establish more relationships than us. 
Recently proposed changes in the financial regulatory regime could decrease the current restrictions on banks and other financial institutions and may allow them to compete with us for investment opportunities that were previously not available to them. If these legislations are enacted, it could increase competition with our business. In the face of this competition, we believe access to our Manager’s and Colony Capital’s professionals and their industry expertise and relationships provide us with competitive advantages in assessing risks and determining appropriate pricing for potential investments. We believe these relationships enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities.
Employees
We do not have any employees. We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement between our Manager and us (the “Management Agreement”). Our executive officers are employees of our Manager or one or more of its affiliates.
