Corporate History 
 
Prior to April 1, 2004, Sandston Corporation was named Nematron Corporation (“Nematron” or the “Company”), which was incorporated in Michigan in October 1983. In 1986, Nematron became a wholly owned subsidiary of Interface Systems, Inc. ("Interface"). The former business of Nematron was the design, manufacture and marketing of factory automation products, including computer hardware and software products. On March 31, 2004 Nematron sold to NC Acquisition Corp. ("NCAC") all of its tangible and intangible assets, including its real estate, accounts, equipment, intellectual property, inventory, goodwill and other intangibles, and all subsidiaries except for $30,000 in cash, (the "Net Asset Sale"). NCAC also assumed all of Nematron’s liabilities pursuant to the Net Asset Sale. Following the Net Asset Sale, Nematron’s only remaining assets were $30,000 in cash; it retained no liabilities. Pursuant to the Net Asset Sale, and effective April 1, 2004 the Company has no subsidiaries. On April 1, 2004 NCAC amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Sandston Corporation (the “Company”) and implemented a shareholder-approved one-for-five reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock.
