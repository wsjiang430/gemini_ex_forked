ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Citizens Financial Group, Inc. is the 13th largest retail bank holding company in the United States.(1) Headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, Citizens offers a broad range of retail and commercial banking products and services to more than five million individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies, large corporations and institutions, largely through approximately 1,100 branches in 11 states in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions and approximately 140 retail and commercial non-branch offices located in our branch banking footprint and in other states and the District of Columbia, which are contiguous with our footprint. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $160.5 billion, total deposits of $119.6 billion and total stockholders’ equity of $20.8 billion.
Citizens is a bank holding company which was incorporated under Delaware state law in 1984 and whose primary federal regulator is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). As of December 31, 2018, our primary subsidiaries were Citizens Bank, N.A. (“CBNA”), a national banking association whose primary federal regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania (“CBPA”), a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank regulated by the Department of Banking of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) as its primary federal regulator. On January 2, 2019, we consolidated our banking subsidiaries via a merger of CBPA into CBNA in order to streamline governance and enterprise risk management, improve CBNA’s risk profile and gain operational efficiencies. CBNA is now our primary subsidiary and our sole banking subsidiary.
Business Segments 
We manage our business through two reportable business operating segments: Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The Company’s activities outside the two business operating segments are classified as “Other” and include treasury activities, wholesale funding activities, securities portfolio, community development assets and other unallocated assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision for credit losses and expenses, including income tax expense. The Other classification also includes the financial impact of non-core, liquidating loan portfolios and other non-core assets and liabilities. For a description of non-core assets, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Analysis of Financial Condition — Loans and Leases — Non-Core Assets” in Part II, Item 7, of this Report. For additional information regarding our business segments see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — 2018 compared with 2017 — Business Operating Segments” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 25 “Business Operating Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Report.

Business Strategy
Our mission is to help each of our customers, colleagues and communities reach their potential, and our vision is to be a top-performing bank distinguished by our customer-centric culture, mindset of continuous improvement and excellent capabilities. It is embedded in our culture to make sure we understand our customers’ needs so we can tailor advice and solutions to make our customers more successful. Our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability, and our success rests on our ability to distinguish ourselves as follows:
Maintain a high-performing, customer-centric organization: To accomplish this, we are embedding a “customer-first” culture among our managers and colleagues to deliver the best possible banking experience for our customers. For our colleagues, we are driving talent management to the next level, with a focus on attracting, developing and retaining great people, and ensuring strong leadership, teamwork and a sense of accountability and urgency. 
Develop differentiated value propositions to acquire, deepen, and retain core customer segments: We have focused on certain customer segments where we believe we are well positioned to compete. In Consumer Banking, we focus on mass market and mass affluent customers. In Commercial Banking, we focus on customers in the middle market, mid-corporate, and certain industry vertical areas. By developing differentiated and targeted value propositions, we believe we can attract new customers, deepen relationships with existing customers, and deliver an enhanced customer experience. 
Build excellent capabilities that will allow us to stand out from our competitors: Across our businesses we strive to deliver seamless, multi-channel experiences and allow customers to interact with us when, where and how they want.

Operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to self-fund investments: We believe that continued focus on operational efficiency is critical to our profitability and the ability to continue to reinvest to drive future growth. We launched the first Tapping our Potential (“TOP”) initiative in late 2014 which was designed to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and competitiveness of the franchise, and we commenced the fifth phase of this initiative in the second half of 2018. 
Prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet: We operate with a strong balance sheet with regard to capital, liquidity and funding, coupled with a well-defined and prudent risk appetite. We are prudently growing our balance sheet and we strive to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns by making good capital and resource allocation decisions through our balance sheet optimization initiatives, being good stewards of our resources, and rigorously evaluating our execution.
Modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery, agility and speed to market: We are continuing to modernize our technology environment so that we can accelerate our speed-to-market and take advantage of technology opportunities in the marketplace. We are also investing in new technologies and leveraging those technologies to deliver better customer outcomes efficiently in order to deliver on our overall financial objectives. We have also engaged in FinTech partnerships that help deliver differentiated digital experiences for our customers.
Embed risk management within our culture and our operations: We are continuing to strengthen our risk management culture and processes as the quality of our risk management program directly affects our ability to execute our strategy, deliver value to our stakeholders and become a top-performing bank. Moreover, our continuous and disciplined enhancements to our processes and talent, as well as our ongoing investments in risk technology and frameworks, serve to support and bolster our risk management capabilities and our regulatory profile.
Competition 
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Our branch footprint is in the New England, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, though certain lines of business serve national markets. Within these markets we face competition from community banks, super-regional and national financial institutions, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of product, pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes. Competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The ability of non-banking financial institutions, including FinTech companies, to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition.
In Consumer Banking, the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone, online and mobile channels. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services in our footprint, despite not having a physical presence there. The emergence of digital-only banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Given their lower cost structure, these institutions are often able to offer on average higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint. The primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates, fees charged, tailored value propositions to different customer segments, customer service levels, convenience, including branch location and hours of operation, and the range of products and services offered. 
In Commercial Banking, there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions, particularly large regional banks, as well as commercial finance companies, leasing companies and other non-bank lenders, and institutional investors including CLO managers, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some larger competitors, including certain national banks that compete in our market area, may offer a broader array of products and, due to their asset size, may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their own balance sheet. We compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions, quality of customer service and execution, range of products offered, price and reputation.
Regulation and Supervision
Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination under federal and state laws. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, conduct and qualifications of personnel and certain transactions with affiliates. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors,

the Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors. The discussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We and our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to numerous examinations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, FINRA and various state insurance and securities regulators. In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries. As part of our regular examination process, our and CBNA’s respective regulators may advise us or CBNA to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. We and CBNA have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and state level, including from state insurance commissions, state attorneys general, federal agencies or law enforcement authorities, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning their business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. For a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, included in this Report. For additional information regarding regulatory and supervisory matters, see Note 18 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.
Overview
We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“Bank Holding Company Act”). We have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act as effected by Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”). As such, we are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the FRB, including through the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Under the system of “functional regulation” established under the Bank Holding Company Act, the FRB serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization, and the SEC serves as the primary regulator of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and directly regulates the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. The Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act require the FRB to examine the activities of non-depository institution subsidiaries of bank holding companies (that are not functionally regulated) that are engaged in depository institution-permissible activities and provide the FRB with back-up examination and enforcement authority for such activities. The FRB also has the authority to require reports of and examine any subsidiary of a bank holding company.
On July 3, 2018, we received regulatory approval from the OCC to consolidate our two banking subsidiaries via a merger of CBPA into CBNA. We completed this consolidation on January 2, 2019, such that CBNA is now our sole banking subsidiary. CBNA is a national banking association. As such, it is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC as its primary federal regulator and by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits. 
The federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. These banking regulators also have the power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. Federal law governs the activities in which CBNA engages, including the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that it may grant to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations. The actions the FRB takes to implement monetary policy also affect CBNA.
In addition, CBNA is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB has broad authority to, among other things, regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products by depository institutions, such as CBNA, with more than $10 billion in total assets. The CFPB may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
Financial Regulatory Reform
The Dodd-Frank Act regulates many aspects of the financial services industry and addresses among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, derivatives and securities markets, restrictions on an insured bank’s transactions with its affiliates, lending limits and mortgage-lending practices. Moreover, as a general matter, in recent years, the federal banking regulators (the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC) as well as the CFPB have taken a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating the financial institutions and financial products and services over which the regulators exercise their respective supervisory authorities, including with respect to enforcement matters. CBNA’s and our products and services have been subject 
9

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.
BUSINESS

to greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements and expectations in recent years, and we expect this scrutiny to continue for the foreseeable future.
Prior to amendment by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (“EGRRCPA”), which was signed into law on May 24, 2018, Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act directed the FRB to establish enhanced prudential standards applicable to systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”), bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The FRB has adopted final rules implementing three aspects of Section 165: liquidity requirements, stress testing of capital, and overall risk management requirements. The current rules’ liquidity requirements are described below under “—Liquidity Requirements”, and their stress testing requirements are described below under “—Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements.” In addition, the resolution planning requirements implemented by the FRB and FDIC are described below under “—Resolution Planning”. 
EGRRCPA amended the Dodd-Frank Act by increasing the asset threshold for application of these enhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion. EGRRCPA’s increased asset threshold took effect immediately for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets less than $100 billion. The increased asset threshold generally will become effective 18 months after the date of enactment (that is, in November 2019) for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion, including Citizens. The FRB is authorized, however, during the 18-month period to exempt, by order, any bank holding company with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion from any enhanced prudential standard requirement. The FRB is also authorized to apply any enhanced prudential standard requirement to any bank holding company with between $100 billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets that would otherwise be exempt under EGRRCPA, if the FRB determines that such action is appropriate to address risks to financial stability and promote safety and soundness, taking into consideration certain factors including the bank holding company’s capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities (including financial activities of subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-related factors that the FRB deems appropriate. U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (“G-SIBs”) and bank holding companies with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets remain fully subject to the Dodd-Frank Act’s enhanced prudential standards requirements. 
In October 2018, the FRB and the other federal banking regulators proposed rules that would tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions to implement the EGRRCPA amendments (“Tailoring NPRs”). The proposed rules would assign each U.S. bank holding company with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, as well as its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and five risk-based indicators: (i) cross-jurisdictional activity, (ii) weighted short-term wholesale funding, (iii) nonbank assets, (iv) off-balance sheet exposure, and (v) status as a U.S. G-SIB. Under the Tailoring NPRs, “Category IV standards” would apply to banking organizations with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for Categories I through III. Category I standards would be applicable to U.S. G-SIBs; Category II standards would be applicable to non-G-SIBs with $700 billion or more in total consolidated assets or at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets and $75 billion or more in cross-jurisdictional activity; and Category III standards would be applicable to banking organizations that are not subject to Category I or Category II standards and that have at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets and $75 billion or more in any of three indicators: (i) nonbank assets, (ii) weighted short-term wholesale funding, or (iii) off-balance sheet exposures.
In connection with the release of the proposed rules, FRB staff indicated which firms would fall into each of the four categories based on data for the second quarter of 2018. According to the FRB staff’s projections, Citizens would be a “Category IV” firm under the proposed rules. Firms subject to Category IV standards would generally be subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with under $100 billion in total consolidated assets, but would also be required to monitor and report certain risk-based indicators. Accordingly, under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms would (i) no longer be subject to any LCR or proposed NSFR requirement, (ii) remain not subject to advanced approaches capital requirements, (iii) remain eligible to opt-out of the requirement to recognize most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in regulatory capital, (iv) remain not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio, (v) remain not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer, (vi) no longer be subject to company-run stress testing requirements and (vii) become subject to supervisory stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis. We discuss other elements of the proposed rules where relevant below. The Tailoring NPRs are subject to modification through the federal rulemaking process in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act.
The U.S. Basel III rules, summarized briefly in the “—Capital” section below, have impacted our level of capital, and may influence the types of business we may pursue and how we pursue business opportunities. Among other things, the U.S. Basel III rules raised the required minimums for certain capital ratios, added a common equity 
10

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.
BUSINESS

ratio, included capital buffers, and restricted what constitutes capital. The capital and risk weighting requirements became effective for us on January 1, 2015.
Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, EGRRCPA, and other laws are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. The ultimate effects of EGRRCPA and the Tailoring NPRs on Citizens, CBNA and their respective subsidiaries and activities will be subject to the final form of the Tailoring NPRs and additional rulemakings issued by the FRB and other federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the CFPB and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others.
Financial Holding Company Regulation
The Bank Holding Company Act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than (i) banking, managing or controlling banks, (ii) furnishing services to or performing services for subsidiaries and (iii) activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. For so long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding company status, financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities, including, among other things, securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the FRB, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the FRB determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. In addition, a financial holding company may conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the FRB.
As noted above, we currently have elected to be treated as a financial holding company under amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act as effected by GLBA. To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed (as described below under “Federal Deposit Insurance Act”), and maintain a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory.” If a financial holding company ceases to meet the capital and management requirements, the FRB’s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. In addition, the failure to meet such requirements could result in other material restrictions on the activities of the financial holding company, may also adversely affect the financial holding company’s ability to enter into certain transactions, including acquisition transactions, or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, and may result in the bank holding company losing financial holding company status. Any restrictions imposed on our activities by the FRB may not necessarily be made known to the public. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, which period may be extended, the FRB may require the financial holding company to divest its subsidiary depository institutions or to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company. If any insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory,” the financial holding company would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.
Capital
We must comply with the FRB’s capital adequacy rules, and CBNA must comply with similar capital adequacy rules of the OCC. The capital adequacy rules of both agencies are based on the Basel III framework. For more detail on our regulatory capital, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital and Regulatory Matters” in Part II, Item 7, included in this Report.
The U.S. Basel III rules, among other things, (i) impose a capital measure called common equity tier 1 capital, or “CET1 capital”, (ii) specify that tier 1 capital consists of CET1 capital and “additional tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 capital narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to previous regulations. Under the U.S. Basel III rules, the minimum capital ratios are:
11

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.
BUSINESS

•4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets;
•6.0% tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;
•8.0% total capital (that is, tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
•4.0% tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized 
 approach (known as the “leverage ratio”).
The U.S. Basel III rules also impose a capital conservation buffer (“CCB”) on top of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios listed above. The implementation of the CCB began on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and increased by 0.625% annually over a three year phase-in period, which ended January 1, 2019. The CCB for 2018 was 1.875%, and increased to its fully phased-in level of 2.5% as of January 1, 2019. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the fully phased-in CCB is taken into account (that is, 7.0% for CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.5% for tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and 10.5% for total capital to risk-weighted assets) will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). For more details, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital and Regulatory Matters” in Part II, Item 7, included in this Report. On April 10, 2018, the FRB issued a proposal designed to create a single, integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of firms’ capital plans with the CCB requirement. Details of this proposal are discussed under “—Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements” below. Although the proposal, if adopted, would change the way in which the minimum capital ratios are calculated, firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios. 
We are also subject to the FRB's risk-based capital requirements for market risk. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Risk — Market Risk Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7, included in this Report, for further discussion.
The U.S. Basel III rules also provide for a number of deductions from, and adjustments to, CET1 capital. For example, certain deferred tax assets (“DTAs”), mortgage servicing assets, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 capital or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1 capital. The deductions and other adjustments to CET1 capital generally became fully phased-in on January 1, 2018, although, as discussed below, the federal banking regulators have extended the transitional treatment for certain items.
In November 2017, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that extended the 2017 transition provisions for certain U.S. Basel III capital rules for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including us. Effective January 1, 2018, the final rule retains the 2017 U.S. Basel III transitional treatment of certain DTAs, mortgage servicing assets, investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests. As a result, since January 1, 2018, our mortgage servicing assets have retained their 2017 risk weight treatment, which will continue until the federal banking regulators revise the extended transitional treatment under the November 2017 final rule, which may occur in connection with the finalization of the related September 2017 proposal to simplify the capital treatment of certain DTAs, mortgage servicing assets, significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests.
The U.S. Basel III rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighting many categories of assets. These categories generally range from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, to 1,250% for certain securitization exposures.
With respect to CBNA, the U.S. Basel III rules also revise the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below in “Federal Deposit Insurance Act.”
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2027. Under the current U.S. Basel III rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to CFG or CBNA. The impact of Basel IV on CFG and CBNA will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the FRB and the OCC.

Liquidity Requirements
We are currently subject to the Basel III-based U.S. LCR rule, which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bank holding company maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario; however, as noted above, under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms, including Citizens, would no longer be subject to any LCR requirement. The LCR rule currently applies in its most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches bank holding companies (that is, those with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures) and depository institution subsidiaries of such bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The LCR rule, following the threshold amendments under EGRRCPA, currently applies in a modified form to bank holding companies such as the Parent Company that have $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure. The U.S. version of the LCR differs in certain respects from the Basel Committee’s version; the U.S. version includes a narrower definition of high-quality liquid assets, different prescribed cash inflow and outflow assumptions for certain types of instruments and transactions, and a shorter phase-in schedule that began on January 1, 2015 and is now complete. The modified LCR currently requires us to maintain a ratio of high-quality liquid assets to net cash outflows of 70% (compared to 100% in the comprehensive LCR applicable to advanced approaches bank holding companies). At December 31, 2018, our LCR on the modified basis was above the minimum requirement. 
Until the changes to the LCR requirement contained in the Tailoring NPRs are adopted, as a modified LCR company, we are required to calculate our LCR on a monthly basis. If a covered company fails to meet the minimum required LCR, it must promptly notify its primary federal banking regulator and may be required to take remedial actions. In December 2016, the FRB issued a final rule that requires bank holding companies currently subject to the LCR rule to disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative and qualitative information about certain components of their LCR. For modified LCR bank holding companies, this disclosure requirement began with the fourth quarter of 2018 and is required to be disclosed by March 1, 2019. We will publish the required information on quantitative and qualitative components of our LCR on our regulatory filings and disclosures page on our Investor Relations website at http://investor.citizensbank.com. 
The Basel III framework also includes a second liquidity standard, the NSFR, which is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon. In May 2016, the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including Citizens; however, as noted above, under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms, including Citizens, would not be subject to any NSFR requirement. Under the 2016 proposal, the most stringent requirements would apply to advanced approaches bank holding companies, and would have required such organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 1.0 on an ongoing basis, calculated by dividing the organization’s available stable funding (“ASF”) by its required stable funding (“RSF”). Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not advanced approaches bank holding companies, including Citizens, would have been subject to a modified NSFR requirement which would have required such bank holding companies to maintain a minimum NSFR of 0.7 on an ongoing basis. Under the 2016 proposal, a banking organization’s ASF would have been calculated by applying specified standard weightings to its equity and liabilities based on their expected stability over a one-year time horizon and its RSF would be calculated by applying specified standardized weightings to its assets, derivative exposures and commitments based on their liquidity characteristics over the same one-year time horizon. 
Finally, per the liquidity rules included in the FRB’s enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (referred to above under “—Financial Regulatory Reform”), we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days. The liquidity buffer is in addition to the federal banking regulators’ LCR rule and is described by the FRB as being “complementary” to the LCR. Under the Tailoring NPRs, the liquidity buffer requirements for Category IV firms, such as Citizens, would not change, and Category IV firms would remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements; however, these requirements would be tailored such that these firms would be required to: (i) calculate collateral positions monthly, as opposed to weekly as is currently required; (ii) establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than are currently required; and (iii) monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than are currently monitored. Category IV firms would also be subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly, rather than monthly, and would be required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis.
     Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements
Under the CCAR process, bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to develop and maintain a capital plan and to submit the plan to the FRB for review. CCAR is designed to 
13

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.
BUSINESS

evaluate a bank holding company’s capital adequacy, capital adequacy process and planned capital distributions, such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases. As part of CCAR, the FRB evaluates whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital to continue operations under various hypothetical scenarios of economic and financial market stress. These scenarios currently include both bank holding company- and FRB-developed scenarios, including an “adverse” and a “severely adverse” stress scenario (although the FRB, on January 8, 2019, proposed amendments that, among other things, would eliminate the adverse scenario). The FRB also evaluates whether the bank holding company has robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that accounts for the bank holding company’s unique risks. 
Due to the importance and intensity of the stress tests and the CCAR process, we have dedicated significant resources to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements and may continue to do so in the future.
Currently, any capital plan submitted to the FRB must cover a “planning horizon” of at least nine quarters beginning with the quarter preceding the submission of the plan (for example, January 1, 2020 for the capital plans required to be filed on or before April 5, 2020). Bank holding companies are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit their capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule, or when required by the FRB. The FRB determines whether to object to a company’s capital plan based on whether the plan passes quantitative tests requiring that the company demonstrate that it will continue to meet all minimum capital requirements applicable to it over the nine-quarter planning horizon under all applicable scenarios. The FRB also incorporates an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firm’s capital planning process into regular, ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted, horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning. 
The FRB’s capital planning and stress testing rules generally make our ability to make quarterly capital distributions in the form of dividends and share repurchases contingent on the FRB’s non-objection to our capital plan, and limit our ability to make quarterly capital distributions if the amount of our actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than we indicated in our submitted capital plan for which we received a non-objection from the FRB. 
Should the FRB object to a capital plan, a bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions to which the FRB has indicated its non-objection in writing. Participating firms are currently required to submit their capital plans and stress testing results to the FRB on or before April 5th of each year in which they are participating, and the FRB will publish the results of its supervisory CCAR review of submitted capital plans by June 30th of each year. In addition, the FRB will separately publish the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios. The information to be released will include, among other things, the FRB’s projection of company-specific information, including post-stress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon. 
 On February 5, 2019, the FRB announced that certain less-complex BHCs with less than $250 billion in assets, including Citizens, would not be required to be subject to supervisory stress testing, company-run stress testing, or the CCAR quantitative assessment for the 2019 cycle (although firms could elect to submit a capital plan for the 2019 cycle). The FRB has also announced that, unless Citizens elects to submit a capital plan for the 2019 cycle, for the period from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, Citizens may make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed Citizens to remain above all minimum capital requirements in CCAR 2018, adjusted for any changes in Citizens’ regulatory capital ratios since the FRB acted on Citizens’ 2018 capital plan. We remain subject to the requirement to develop and maintain an annual capital plan that is reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors (or one of its committees), and we must submit our planned capital actions for the period between July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 to the FRB by April 5, 2019.
Additionally, under the Tailoring NPRs, Category IV firms, such as Citizens, would no longer be subject to company-run stress testing requirements (i.e., the requirement to stress test using bank holding company-developed and supervisory scenarios), but would remain subject to the quantitative review of their capital plans under CCAR, which the FRB noted that it plans to propose to conduct on a biennial, instead of annual, basis. In connection with the release of the Tailoring NPRs, the FRB noted that it expects to revise its guidance relating to capital planning to align with the proposed categories of standards set forth in the Tailoring NPRs, and the impact of the future proposal on Citizens and its capital planning process will depend on the final form of the FRB’s revised guidance. 
Lastly, and as noted above, the FRB’s April 10, 2018 proposal to create a single, integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of CCAR with the CCB requirement would, if adopted, replace the current static 2.5% CCB with a stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement. The SCB, subject to a minimum of 2.5%, would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the FRB’s supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The proposal would also introduce a stress leverage buffer (“SLB”) requirement, similar to the SCB, which would apply to the Tier 1 leverage ratio. In addition, the 
14

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.
BUSINESS

proposal would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of CCAR but would require a bank holding company to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bank holding company’s own baseline scenario projections. The FRB has stated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer requirements that would be applicable to Category IV bank holding companies to align with the proposed two-year supervisory stress testing cycle for Category IV bank holding companies. As is currently the case, under the proposal, a bank holding company subject to CCAR would generally not be permitted to exceed the capital distributions reflected in its capital plan either on a gross basis or net of capital issuances without prior approval of the FRB.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by EGRRCPA, a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as Citizens, must currently submit a periodic resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC providing for the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure. We are required to submit our most recent resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC by December 31, 2019. If the FRB and the FDIC jointly determine that our plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and we do not cure the deficiencies, the FRB and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. In connection with the release of the Tailoring NPRs, the FRB noted that it expects to release a proposal to amend, with the FDIC, their joint resolution plan rule to address the applicability of resolution plan requirements for U.S. bank holding companies with between $100 billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets, including Citizens, and to adjust the scope and applicability of resolution plan requirements for firms that remain subject to them. 
The FDIC has separately implemented a resolution planning rule that currently requires insured depository institutions of $50 billion or more in total assets, such as CBNA, to periodically submit a resolution plan. CBNA submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC in July 2018.
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The FDIA requires the FRB, OCC and FDIC to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions, including CBNA. The agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard, it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. If, after being notified to submit a compliance plan, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the FDIA. See “Federal Deposit Insurance Act” below. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
Federal Deposit Insurance Act
The FDIA requires, among other things, that the federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements, as described above in “Capital.” The FDIA sets forth the following five capital categories: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. The federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category. Under existing rules, an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has (i) a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, (ii) a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, (iii) a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and (iv) a tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%.
The FDIA’s prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies. The FRB’s regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define “well capitalized” for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% and a total capital ratio of at least 10%. As described above under “—Financial Holding Company Regulation”, a financial holding company that is not well-capitalized and well-managed (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed) under 
15

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.
BUSINESS

applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status. As of December 31, 2018, the Parent Company and CBNA were well-capitalized. 
The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. The FDIA imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “well-capitalized.”
Deposit Insurance
The FDIA requires CBNA to pay deposit insurance assessments. FDIC assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards, one for most large institutions that have more than $10 billion in assets and another for “highly complex” institutions that have over $50 billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over $500 billion in assets. Each scorecard has a performance score and a loss-severity score that are combined to produce a total score, which is translated into an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC utilizes the CAMELS ratings and forward-looking financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score, up or down, based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard. The total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a non-linear, sharply-increasing scale. Since July 1, 2016, for large institutions the initial base assessment rate has ranged from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis.
The deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. Deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). In March 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposed on insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in assets, including CBNA, a surcharge of 4.5 basis points per annum that continued through September 30, 2018, when the reserve ratio of the DIF reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%; therefore, the surcharge no longer applies.
Dividends
Various federal statutory provisions and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay.
Our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the FRB. In particular, the FRB reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bank holding company based on capital plans submitted as part of the CCAR process and on the results of stress tests, as discussed above. The FRB assesses dividend policies and share repurchases against, among other things, the bank holding company’s ability to achieve the required capital ratios under the Basel III-based U.S. revised capital rules. In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital distributions (including dividends and share repurchases) is contingent on the FRB’s non-objection to such planned distributions included in our submitted capital plan or the FRB’s authorization to make distributions if we are exempt from the requirement to submit a capital plan. See “—Capital” and “—Capital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements” above.
Dividends payable by CBNA, as a national bank subsidiary, are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements which provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings. 
16

CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

Support of Subsidiary Bank
Under Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which codifies the FRB’s long-standing “source of strength” doctrine, we must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary. The statute defines “source of financial strength” as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution. The FRB may require that we provide such support at times even when we may not have the financial resources to do so, or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related FRB rules, including Regulation W, restrict CBNA from extending credit to, or engaging in certain other transactions with, us and our non-bank subsidiaries. These restrictions place limits on certain specified “covered transactions” between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates, which must be limited to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from 100% to 130%. Covered transactions are defined to include, among other things, a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, derivatives transactions and securities lending transactions where the bank has credit exposure to an affiliate, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. All covered transactions, including certain additional transactions (such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest), must be conducted on market terms. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly enhanced and expanded the scope and coverage of these limitations, in particular, by including within its scope derivative transactions by and between CBNA or its subsidiaries and the Parent Company or its other subsidiaries. The FRB enforces these restrictions and we are audited for compliance.
Section 23B prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Except for limitations on low-quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound, Regulation W generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates. Transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits. The FRB also may designate banking subsidiaries as affiliates.
Pursuant to FRB Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit (i) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (iii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board.
Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in, sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for the exclusions in sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that act, both subject to certain limited exceptions. The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” The regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, jointly issued by the FRB, OCC, FDIC, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), require that large bank holding companies design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the Volcker Rule’s prohibitions. Maintenance and monitoring of the required compliance program requires the expenditure of resources and management attention. In July 2018, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to tailor the application of the Volcker Rule based on the size and scope of a banking entity’s trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. The ultimate impact of any amendments to the Volcker Rule will depend on, among other things, further rulemaking and implementation guidance from the relevant U.S. federal regulatory agencies and the development of market practices and standards.

Consumer Financial Protection Regulations
The retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts.
In addition to these federal laws and regulations, the guidance and interpretations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influences loan and deposit operations.
The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.
The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The CFPB implemented a number of significant rules which will impact nearly every aspect of the life cycle of a residential mortgage. The final rules require banks to, among other things: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new “ability to repay” standard and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a “qualified mortgage;” (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products; and (v) maintain escrow accounts for “higher priced mortgage loans” for a longer period of time. 
Protection of Customer Personal Information and Cybersecurity
The privacy provisions of GLBA generally prohibit financial institutions, including us, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information sharing among affiliates for marketing purposes. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, issued by the FRB, govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies.
In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers’ accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. For a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of this Report.
In October 2016, federal regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision. Once established, the enhanced cyber risk management standards would help to reduce the potential impact of a cyber-attack or other cyber-related failure on the financial system. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards: (i) cyber risk governance; (ii) cyber risk management; (iii) internal dependency management; (iv) external dependency management; and (v) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. We will continue to monitor any developments related to this proposed rulemaking.

State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate. 
Community Reinvestment Act Requirements
The CRA requires banking regulators to evaluate us and CBNA in meeting the credit needs of our local communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate- income neighborhoods. The CRA requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its examination of a depository institution, to assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution and assign ratings. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public. These evaluations are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility and, in the case of a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status, a CRA rating of at least “satisfactory” is required to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged in such activities. We received a rating of “outstanding” in our most recent CRA evaluation. 
In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the Federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks, and in August 2018, the OCC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting “ideas for building a new framework to transform or modernize the regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act,” without proposing any specific revisions to present CRA requirements. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA.
Compensation
Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and the OCC. The federal banking regulators have issued guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization’s supervisory ratings.
The U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the SEC, jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations, among other things, prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including the Parent Company and CBNA). These regulations have not been finalized and the timing of final adoption and the form of any final regulations is uncertain. If the rules are adopted in the form proposed, they may restrict our flexibility with respect to the manner in which we structure compensation and adversely affect our ability to compete for talent.
Anti-Money Laundering
The USA PATRIOT Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006, substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. We are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. We also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks.

The USA PATRIOT Act also provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. The statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: (i) requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (ii) promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (iii) requiring reports by non-financial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) for transactions exceeding $10,000; and (iv) mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations. The statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
FinCEN drafts regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act legislation. In May 2018, a FinCEN rule became effective which requires financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the “OFAC” rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Regulation of Broker-Dealers
Our subsidiary CCMI is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and, as a result, is subject to regulation and examination by the SEC as well as FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations. These regulations cover a broad range of issues, including capital requirements; sales and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-keeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material non-public information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions. In addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker-dealers.
     Heightened Risk Governance Standards
CBNA is subject to OCC guidelines imposing heightened risk governance standards on large national banks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The guidelines set forth minimum standards for the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework, and minimum standards for oversight of that framework by a bank’s board of directors. The guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and improve bank examiners’ ability to assess compliance with the OCC’s expectations. Under the guidelines, a bank may use its parent company’s risk governance framework if the framework meets the minimum standards, the risk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same, and certain other conditions are met. CBNA has elected to use the Parent Company’s risk governance framework. A bank’s board of directors is required to have two members who are independent of the bank and parent company management. A bank’s board

of directors is responsible for ensuring that the risk governance framework meets the standards in the guidelines, providing active oversight and a credible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions and ensuring that the parent company decisions do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank.
Anti-Tying Restrictions
Generally, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to that bank or its bank holding company or their subsidiaries or (ii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. A bank may however, offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products. Certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule.
Commercial Real Estate Lending
Lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators. Regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations. Such loans generally include land development, construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property and nonfarm, nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property. The relevant regulatory guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny:

• | Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the institution’s total capital, or


• | Total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of the institution’s total capital, and the outstanding balance of the institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that may cause us to reduce the amount of our commercial real estate lending and increase the cost of borrowing, including rules relating to risk retention of securitized assets. Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing rules adopted by the U.S. financial services regulators, including the federal banking regulators and the SEC, require, among other things, a loan originator or a securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain a percentage of the credit risk of securitized assets. We continue to analyze the impact that such rules have on our business.
 Intellectual Property
In the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are important to the success of our business. We own and license a variety of trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and pending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our stand-alone brands.
 Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 18,100 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 17,800 full-time colleagues, 100 part-time colleagues and 200 temporary employees. None of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
