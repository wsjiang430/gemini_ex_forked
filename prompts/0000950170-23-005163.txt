 Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, technology, and know-how) are material to our business.
We own or have the right to use numerous trademarks and patents in many countries. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as we use them, or as long as we maintain their registration status. Trademark registrations are generally for renewable, fixed terms.

 Government Regulation and Compliance
The principal rules and regulations affecting our day-to-day business relate to our employees (such as regulations implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines implemented pursuant to the Americans

with Disabilities Act, and general federal and state employment laws), unionized labor (such as guidelines imposed by the National Labor Relations Act), United States and Canadian regulations relating to national parks (such as regulations established by Parks Canada, the United States Department of the Interior, and the United States National Park Service), United States and Canadian regulations relating to boating (such as regulations implemented by the United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard and state boating laws), and transportation (such as regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and its state counterparts).
 Our current and former businesses are subject to federal and state environmental regulations. Compliance with these provisions, and environmental stewardship generally, is key to our ongoing operations. To date, these provisions have not had, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our results of current and discontinued operations.
On July 18, 2020, an off-road Ice Explorer operated by our Pursuit business was involved in an accident while enroute to the Athabasca Glacier, resulting in three fatalities and multiple other serious injuries. We continue to support the victims and their families. We immediately reported the accident to our relevant insurance carriers, who are also supporting the investigation and subsequent claims. In May 2022, we received charges from the Canadian office of Occupational Health and Safety in relation to this accident. We continue to cooperate fully with regulatory agencies regarding this accident. In addition, we believe that our reserves and, subject to customary deductibles, our insurance coverage is sufficient to cover potential claims and regulatory fines related to this accident.
 Human Capital
 Our people drive our success. We foster a culture that is equitable and inclusive, celebrates our talent, and prioritizes the safety and wellness of our teams, clients, and guests. We are committed to cultivating an environment where people of all different backgrounds feel a sense of belonging and contribute to our continued success.
We had the following number of employees as of December 31, 2022:
 
 | Number ofEmployees (1) | 
GES | | 2,440
Pursuit | | 913 
Viad Corporate | | 34 
Total | | 3,387

 (1)Includes 505 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and excludes seasonal or temporary employees. The employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are largely used to staff GES’ shows, events, and production facilities pursuant to business demands. The transportation teams at Pursuit’s Banff Jasper Collection are covered by collective bargaining agreements as well as the majority of our Iceland workforce. We believe that relations with our employees are good and that collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2023 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without adverse effects on our operations.
 GES hires temporary employees on a show-by-show basis. The number of temporary employees fluctuates depending on the size and location of the exhibition or event. Pursuit hires approximately 2,000 seasonal employees during the peak summer months to help operate its attractions and hospitality properties.
 We are governed by a Board of Directors comprising eight non-employee directors and one employee director, and we have an executive management team with six executive officers.
 Diversity, inclusion, and belonging
 We take pride in our diverse community. We believe diversity and gender equality are critical to building a thriving workplace. We strive to create an environment where people of all different backgrounds feel a sense of belonging and contribute to our continued success. To make our workplace as inclusive and safe as possible, we have diversity and inclusion training integrated into our Always Honest Compliance and Ethics Program.
 We do not discriminate against employees or applicants based on race, color, age, disability, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, genetics or genetic information, or any other categories protected by applicable law. We are committed to equal opportunity in all of our employment activities, including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, compensation, determination of benefits, training, promotion, and discipline. We also provide reasonable accommodations to disabled persons, so all employees can achieve success in the workplace.
We take pride in the diverse and talented group of people that make up our Board of Directors, executive management team, and employees. We understand the value that a diverse workforce of varying genders, ethnicity, background, and experience brings to the Company and we are focused on improving diversity at all levels. With our appointment of Beverly K. Carmichael and Patrick T.

LaValley to our Board of Directors in 2022, we now have three female Board members and two minorities out of a total of eight non-employee Board members. In 2022, more than 45% of our overall global workforce was female.
As a devoted steward to our communities, we are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce to better reflect the communities in which we operate. We have undertaken initiatives, which go beyond legal compliance, to recruit from diverse audiences, such as minorities, women, and veterans. These efforts include leveraging inclusive job-posting sites and sharing job postings with community partners.
 As part of our commitment to developing our employees and furthering their professional growth, we have programs in place including GES’ Business Development Mentor Program and the newly launched training platform for people leaders, including “Spiro.You” at Spiro, “Sales Leadership Program” at GES Exhibitions, and “Leaders’ Journey” at Pursuit. These programs connect new hires, which are recent graduates, with leaders within our organization and is designed to accelerate their career trajectory.
Our emphasis on equality permeates throughout the organization and helps drive our success. For example, we conduct periodic employee engagement surveys to help us understand, recognize, and respect the diversity within our team. These surveys help shape our training and development plans to ensure we are maintaining an inclusive culture by engaging, developing, and retaining our talented team members across the globe.
 Safety and well-being
 The safety and well-being of team members, clients, and guests is a leading core value. We believe that maintaining strong standards of health and safety improves employee productivity and operational efficiency and enhances employee well-being.
Our employees have a responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy work environment. We take prompt action to correct unsafe or hazardous conditions; we promptly report work-related accidents and injuries in accordance with established procedures and applicable laws; we strive to follow all established work rules related to safety; we educate our workers to ensure they understand the risks, know how to handle hazardous products safely, and are familiar with available information for all hazardous materials used. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we rapidly designed and implemented enhanced health and safety protocols to protect our team members who continued to perform critical on-site and front-line work serving our clients and guests.
Both Pursuit and GES have implemented business-specific programs that support our commitment to the safety and well-being of our team members, clients, and guests. Pursuit’s Safety Promise is our commitment to the safety and well-being of our guests and staff. Through this program, we ensure that everyone feels safe when visiting our experiences and that these places can continue to make a positive impact. GES’ Always On Health and Safety Program was designed by our safety team to protect our employees, customers, partners, and event attendees. GES employees are committed to adhering to all local government and facility requirements and those established in conjunction with our partners and clients. Safe, reliable delivery of events is one of our most significant responsibilities.
 Compliance and ethics
 We believe that maintaining a culture of high ethical standards gives us a distinct advantage in recruiting and retaining top talent, delivering the best experience for our customers, and attracting shareholders. Our Always Honest Compliance and Ethics Program, with the full support of our Board of Directors, has guided us since 1994 to translate integrity into our everyday behavior and actions. The Always Honest Compliance and Ethics Program guides our employees to act honestly, ethically, and always in compliance with the law.
 Community involvement
 Giving back to the community is very important to us. We are committed to making a positive impact within the communities we serve through educational programs such as GES’ Exhibition Sponsorships, volunteer services, and environmental/economic sustainable efforts in the community. Many of our offices pull together to volunteer and support local and national organizations. The Banff Jasper Collection was awarded Corporate Citizen of the Year in Jasper, Alberta in recognition of its community building efforts. Pursuit also supported an exchange of learning and renewed its dedication to reconciliation with local Indigenous communities through a variety of initiatives and programs.
 Rewards and performance management
 Beyond a competitive salary, we offer a range of healthcare benefits to full-time employees, their spouses, and dependents. We encourage our employees to grow professionally with ongoing training and internal career opportunities. We utilize a performance review process, which aligns our core competencies to our core values, and a performance management cycle, which provides a framework designed to maximize performance and cultivate talent. Short- and long-term incentive compensation for senior managers and executives is based on the Company’s performance and/or stock performance.
