ITEM 1.    Business
Overview 
Boyd Gaming Corporation (the "Company," the "Registrant," "Boyd Gaming," "we" or "us") is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company that has been in operation since 1975. Headquartered in Las Vegas, we operate 29 wholly owned gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Our primary areas of focus are: (i) ensuring our existing operations are managed as efficiently as possible and remain positioned for growth, including our strategic investing in non-gaming amenities; (ii) improving our capital structure and strengthening our balance sheet, including paying down debt, increasing free cash flow, improving operations and diversifying our asset base; and (iii) successfully implementing our growth strategy, which is built on identifying development opportunities and acquiring assets that are a good strategic fit and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders. 
We operate with an efficient business model that we believe has enabled us to grow operating margins over the past several years, and we believe we have an opportunity to realize additional cost savings by further leveraging our size and scale. We strategically reinvest in our non-gaming amenities, including hotel rooms and restaurants to refresh our property offerings and better capitalize on customers' evolving spending behaviors. We manage our cost and expense structure to adjust to current business volumes and to generate strong and stable cash flows.
During 2018, we completed several transactions that improved our long-term financial position and strengthened our balance sheet. During second quarter 2018, we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.000% senior notes due August 2026. The net proceeds from the debt issuance were ultimately used to fund the acquisitions of Valley Forge Convention Center Partners, L.P., the owner and operator of Valley Forge Casino Resort ("Valley Forge"), and the owners and operators of the four Pinnacle properties - Ameristar Casino Kansas City, LLC, the owner and operator of Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City ("Ameristar Kansas City"), Ameristar Casino St. Charles, LLC, the owner and operator of Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles ("Ameristar St. Charles"), Belterra Resort Indiana LLC, the owner and operator of Belterra Casino Resort ("Belterra Resort"), located in Florence, Indiana, and PNK (Ohio), LLC, the owner and operator of Belterra Park ("Belterra Park"), located in Cincinnati, Ohio (collectively, the "Pinnacle Properties"). During third quarter 2018, we entered into a Joinder Agreement to our credit agreement which joined additional financial institutions as lenders thereunder and increased the commitments under our senior secured revolving credit facility and Term A Loan. On December 12, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a new stock repurchase program of $100 million. This program is in addition to our existing repurchase authorization. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $59.6 million under these repurchase authorizations. The Company declared quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share on March 2, 2018 and $0.06 per share on June 8, 2018, September 14, 2018 and December 7, 2018.
We continually work to position our Company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through acquisitions, capital investments and other strategic initiatives. An example is our recent strategic initiative regarding legalized sports gambling. In July 2018, the Company entered into a partnership agreement with MGM Resorts International. Under this partnership, MGM Resorts and Boyd Gaming will both have the opportunity to offer online and mobile gaming platforms, including sports betting, casino gaming and poker in jurisdictions where either company operates physical casino resorts and online licenses are available. In August 2018, we opened sports books at our two Mississippi properties, IP Casino Resort Spa ("IP") in Biloxi, and Sam's Town Hotel & Gambling Hall in Tunica, following the receipt of final approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Also in August, we entered into a strategic partnership with FanDuel Group to pursue sports betting and online gaming opportunities across the United States.
We believe that the following factors have contributed to our success in the past and are central to our success in the future:

• | nine of our Las Vegas properties are well-positioned to capitalize on the attractive Las Vegas locals market;


• | our three downtown Las Vegas properties focus a majority of their marketing programs on, and derive a majority of their revenues from, a unique niche - Hawaiian customers;


• | our operations are geographically diversified within the United States;


• | we have strengthened our balance sheet and have increased free cash flow;


• | we have the ability to expand certain existing properties and make opportunistic and strategic acquisitions; and

1


• | we have an experienced management team.

Properties 
As of December 31, 2018, we own and operate 29 properties offering a total of 1,765,144 square feet of casino space, 37,288 slot machines, 815 table games and 11,090 hotel rooms. We derive the majority of our revenues from our gaming operations, which generated approximately 73%, 72% and 73% of our revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Food & beverage revenues represent our next most significant revenue source, generating approximately 14% of revenues for 2018, 2017, and 2016. Room revenues and other revenues each contributed less than 10% of revenues during each year.
We view each operating property as an operating segment. For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our properties into three reportable business segments: (i) Las Vegas Locals; (ii) Downtown Las Vegas; and (iii) Midwest & South. 
ALST Casino Holdco LLC, the holding company of Aliante Gaming, LLC, which owns and operates Aliante Casino + Hotel + Spa ("Aliante"), was added to our Las Vegas Locals segment when it was acquired on September 27, 2016, and this segment was further expanded on December 20, 2016, with the acquisition of The Cannery Hotel and Casino, LLC, the owner and operator of Cannery Casino Hotel ("Cannery"), and Nevada Palace, LLC, the owner and operator of Eastside Cannery Casino and Hotel ("Eastside Cannery"). Five properties joined our Midwest & South segment during 2018 following their acquisitions. Valley Forge was acquired on September 17, 2018 and Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Resort and Belterra Park were acquired on October 15, 2018. As a result of the sale of our equity interest in Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa ("Borgata"), we report our interest in Borgata as discontinued operations. See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of these activities.
For financial information related to our segments as of and for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, see Note 13, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8.

Downtown Las Vegas Properties 
Our three Downtown Las Vegas properties directly compete with eight other casinos that operate in downtown Las Vegas. As such, we have developed a distinct niche for our downtown properties by focusing on customers from Hawaii.

We also have strong, informal relationships with other Hawaiian travel agencies and offer affordable all-inclusive packages. These relationships, combined with our Hawaiian promotions, have allowed the Cal, Fremont Hotel and Casino ("Fremont") and Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel ("Main Street Station") to capture a significant share of the Hawaiian tourist trade in Las Vegas.

Competition
Our properties generally operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality, entertainment and leisure companies. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including Native American casinos, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects. 
Strategic Initiatives
Acquisition of Lattner Entertainment Group
To further diversify and expand our business, we acquired Lattner Entertainment Group Illinois, LLC ("Lattner"), in June 2018. At the time of the acquisition, Lattner operated nearly 1,000 gaming units in approximately 220 locations across the state of Illinois. The acquisition of Lattner provides us with an additional avenue to access gaming customers and a platform to participate in the expansion of distributed gaming. 
Market-Access Agreement with MGM Resorts
In July 2018, we and MGM Resorts International ("MGM Resorts") announced a market-access agreement to significantly increase each company's market access and customer base throughout the United States. Under this arrangement, our Company and MGM Resorts both have the opportunity to offer online and mobile gaming platforms - including sports betting, casino gaming and poker - in jurisdictions where either company operates physical casino resorts and online licenses are available. Under this market access agreement, each company has a path to expand their online and mobile gaming presence across 15 states, allowing each company to leverage their scale to create a nationwide approach to online and mobile sports betting, real money casino gaming and poker. As states continue to legalize interactive gaming, both companies will be poised to offer products in mobile and online sports betting, real money casino gaming and poker products where legally applicable.

Strategic Partnership with FanDuel Group
In August 2018, we announced that we had entered into a strategic partnership with FanDuel Group ("FanDuel"), the largest online sports destination in the United States, to pursue sports betting and online gaming opportunities across the country. This partnership brings together two of the largest and most geographically diversified companies in the gaming entertainment industry, given our Company’s scale and experience is being combined with FanDuel’s eight million customers and its presence across 45 states.
Subject to state law and regulatory approvals, we will establish a presence in the online gaming and sports wagering industry by leveraging FanDuel's technology and related services to operate Boyd Gaming-branded mobile and online sports-betting and gaming services. In turn, FanDuel will establish and operate mobile and online sports-betting and gaming services under the FanDuel brand in the states where we are licensed.
Our relationship with FanDuel covers all states where we hold gaming licenses currently and in the future, excluding Nevada. It also covers states included under our market-access agreement with MGM Resorts International. The two companies will also engage in extensive co-branding and cross-promotional efforts. FanDuel will market our properties through its existing daily fantasy sports service and future interactive sports betting and gaming services, while we will promote FanDuel's products to our customer base. FanDuel will also provide our customers access to its existing product line.
Future Development Opportunities
Development agreement with Wilton Rancheria
We have a development agreement and a management agreement with Wilton Rancheria, a federally-recognized Native American tribe located southeast of Sacramento, California, to develop and manage a gaming entertainment complex. In January 2017, the tribe received a favorable Record of Decision from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and in February 2017, the land was taken into trust on behalf of the tribe. In September 2017, the California State Legislature unanimously approved, and the Governor of California executed, a tribal-state gaming compact with the tribe allowing the development of the casino. In October 2018, the National Indian Gaming Commission approved the Company's management contract with the Tribe. With the compact now in place, we are in the process of finalizing project budget, design and construction planning. The project will be constructed using third-party financing. Once commenced and project financing put in place, the construction timeline is expected to span 18 to 24 months. The land parcel taken into trust is located approximately 15 miles southeast of Sacramento on Highway 99, one of the two major north-south freeways in the Sacramento area. 
Frequent Player Loyalty Programs
B Connected
We have established a nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program. Our players use their "B Connected" cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our properties. The "B Connected" club, among other benefits, rewards players for their loyalty as well as entitles them to qualify for promotions and earn rewards toward slot, video poker, or table games play.
In August 2018, we announced the launch of a new B-Connected program, which included new benefits for loyal customers, including annual cruises, vacations, and gifts of luxury jewelry and electronics. The new program has expanded to five player tiers - Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Onyx and Titanium. The new B Connected program is currently available in the Las Vegas valley at Aliante, the Cal, Fremont, Gold Coast, Main Street Station, The Orleans, Sam's Town Las Vegas and Suncoast; in Louisiana at Amelia Belle, Delta Downs, Evangeline Downs, Sam's Town Shreveport and Treasure Chest; in Illinois at Par-A-Dice; in Indiana at Blue Chip; in Iowa at Diamond Jo Worth; and in Mississippi at Sam's Town Tunica and IP. Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Resort and Belterra Park began their implementation of the B Connected program in January 2019 and we expect that the program will be fully integrated at these properties by second quarter 2019. The Company plans to roll out the program to additional properties in early 2019.
In addition to the "B Connected" player loyalty program, we operate the "B Connected Mobile" program, the first multi-property, loyalty program-based iPhone and Android applications of its kind in the gaming industry. B Connected Mobile is a personalized mobile application that delivers customized offers and information directly to a customer’s iPhone, iPad or Android device, making "B Connected Mobile" the first application of its kind available on multiple platforms. The application further expands the benefits of the "B Connected" program by providing real-time personalized information on hotel, dining and gaming offers when a customer visits a Boyd property, instant access to event information, schedules and special offers, a search engine that allows customers to find Boyd Gaming casinos that have their favorite machines and displays the games’ locations on a casino floor map, the ability to track "B Connected" point balances in real time, and the ability to make immediate hotel or restaurant reservations. These tools allow our customers to receive the greatest value from their "B Connected" membership, and ensure that our marketing is as effective as possible.

Other Programs
Kansas Star, Diamond Jo Dubuque, Cannery, Eastside Cannery and Valley Forge continue to sponsor their own player loyalty programs to build brand awareness and leverage loyalty through marketing and promotional programs to retain existing customers, maintain trip frequency, acquire new customers, and recover lapsed customers. These properties offer their guests comprehensive, competitive and targeted marketing and promotion programs. Each program offers players a hassle-free way of earning points redeemable at each respective property for slot and table games play, food, beverage and retail items as well as complementaries and other rewards and benefits based on play. In addition, each property strives to differentiate its casino with high-quality guest services to further enhance overall brand and customer experience.
We plan to extend the B Connected program to these properties, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. The implementation of the B Connected program will replace the individual property programs described above and provide our customers at these properties even more value for their rewards with a multi-property player loyalty program.
Other Promotional Activities
We provide other promotional offers and discounts targeted towards new customers, frequent customers, inactive customers, customers of various levels of play, and prospective customers who have not yet visited our properties, and mid-week and other promotional activities that seek to generate visits to our properties during slower periods. Complementaries are usually in the form of monetary discounts, and other rewards generally can only be redeemed at our restaurants, retail and spa facilities.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. The states in which we operate empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and may require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or not such legislation will be enacted. The federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and the elimination of betting on NCCA events. And with the recent expansion of sports wagering in various state jurisdictions, the federal government may elect to enact legislation taxing and regulating sports wagering, or alternatively may elect to prohibit such wagering. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us. 
Employees and Labor Relations 
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 23,477 persons, and had collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering 1,338 employees. Negotiations for a first contract with an organized bargaining unit are in progress at several of our Las Vegas properties. Negotiations for contract renewal are also in progress at one of our Midwest & South properties.
