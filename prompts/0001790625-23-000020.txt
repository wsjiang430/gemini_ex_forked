Industry Background
In recent years, technological advances have altered business and competitive landscapes at a pace and at a scale that is unprecedented in modern industry. The proliferation of new technologies, such as cloud computing, mobile, social media, artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics and automation delivered in an omni-channel way, and the ability to rent them as-a-service instead of acquiring them outright at significant upfront cost, have diminished the scale and infrastructure advantages of incumbent businesses. This, in turn, has enabled the rise of a new breed of companies, known as “digital disruptors,” across different industries. Digital disruptors use digital technology platforms that are essentially software applications to enable innovative ways of providing products and services to clients. Digital disruptors often differentiate themselves with their extensive expertise in developing and using software. New technologies also give customers and employees more information and choices, changing how and where they engage with enterprises.
Best-in-class software developers have also re-imagined the process of software development. Today, digital disruptors build software by deploying an agile methodology. The traditional waterfall method, premised on a sequential and siloed approach to building software, results in long development cycles, fails to integrate user feedback quickly and is often more expensive than the agile method. The agile method is user-driven and focuses on continuous delivery of small upgrades with multi-disciplinary software development teams rapidly designing, developing, testing, delivering and continually monitoring updates to software. The agile method also enables enterprises to continuously innovate and improve products and processes with greater speed than ever before.
Due to these factors, incumbent enterprises with cumbersome processes have a critical need to digitally transform their businesses in order to compete with new entrants in their markets, enhance customer experiences, drive differentiation, optimize operations and regain their competitive advantages. This requires re-imagining and re-engineering their businesses. In order to undertake digital transformation, enterprises need to devise new business strategies, alter their organizational structures and cultures, and, most importantly, modernize their technology infrastructures.
Our Opportunity
Given the diverse benefits digital transformation brings across industries, we expect the demand to remain robust, especially in key industries such as: retail, healthcare, financial services and professional services. Businesses are focused on protecting themselves from the current environment of uncertainty while making the most of any innovation and automation opportunities to scale their digital business. 
Due to increased demand for artificial intelligence, cloud and analytics we expect worldwide digital transformation spending in each of the healthcare and financial services sectors to increase at an approximate 20% compounded annual growth rate, from 2022 to 2026. Additionally, the fast growing interest in Digital Twins and Robotic Process Automation-Based Claims Processing will allow us to accelerate growth in all of our key industries as the spend for each of these services are expected to grow greater than 30% during the same period.
Our Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
Expand Our Client Footprint in the United States
We are focused on growing our client footprint in the United States and furthering the application of our proven business capabilities in the U.S. market. We acquired 4th Source in 2018 and AgileThought in 2019, both of which are U.S. headquartered and operated companies. These acquisitions have consolidated our presence in the U.S. market which is projected to be the largest geographic market for Digital Transformation spending through 2026, accounting for nearly 35% of the total spending worldwide and surpassing $1.0 trillion spending in 2025. Our 2022 and 2021 revenue from U.S. clients were 63.5% and 65.2% of our total revenue, respectively.
Expand Our Client Footprint in the Latin America
We are also focused on growing our client footprint in Latin America and leveraging our local experience and network to capitalize on the region’s growth potential. The Latin America region is expected to experience the second strongest growth in Digital Transformation from 2022 to 2026 with a five year projected compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20%. Our business started in Mexico and we have established experience in the Latin America market since then, and we believe our experience allows us to tailor our offerings and naturally assertively approach our clients in that market. Our 2022 and 2021 revenue from Latin America clients were 36.5% and 34.8% of our total revenue, respectively.
Penetrate Existing Clients via Cross-Selling
We seek to deepen our relationships with existing clients through relation-based selling and moving ourselves to a trusted client advisor relationship. We also seek to expand wallet share by cross-selling our additional services. Our client relationships generally begin with a proof-of-concept, or a pilot, to address a specific business challenge. After this initial phase, we are able to more easily cross-sell our portfolio of services across organizations. We believe we have a successful track record of expanding our relationships with clients by offering a wide range of complementary services.
Continue to Identify and Build Competencies in Next-Generation Technologies
We are dedicated to remaining at the forefront of market trends and next-generation technologies. We intend to maintain, improve and extend our expertise and delivery capabilities across next-generation and commercially-proven technologies, in order to enhance our clients’ competitive advantage. As we continue to expand, we will remain focused on attracting engineers with next-generation technologies skill-sets, specifically cloud, predictive analytics and causality analysis, and AI, as well as continue to train and update our existing workforce through classroom, on-the-job, and online training programs in key next-generation technologies including Adobe, Appian, ServiceNow and Microsoft Azure.
Strengthen Onshore and Nearshore Delivery with Diversification in Regions
In order to drive digital transformation initiatives for our clients, we believe that we need to be near the regions in which our clients are located and in similar time zones. Our onshore and nearshore agile methodology not only facilitates efficient and reliable client communication and collaboration, but also facilitates our engineers being onsite quickly when required. We have established a strong base for our onshore and nearshore delivery model across Mexico, and we also have offices in Argentina, Brazil and the United States in order to source diverse talent and be responsive to clients in our core markets. We have strategically located our onshore and nearshore delivery centers in areas that are desirable for employees to live, have ample access to innovative technical and industry-experienced talent pools, and have lower IT recruiting competition. One of the positive outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that we have further proven our leading agile delivery capabilities via distributed teams working remotely. This outcome has broadened our capacity to attract and recruit talent located in cities different from where our delivery centers are currently located. As we continue to grow our relationships, we will keep looking for the best talent to expand our footprint in other cities in Mexico as well as other countries.
Attract, Train, Retain and Utilize Highly Skilled Employees
We believe attracting, training, retaining and utilizing highly skilled employees with capabilities in next-generation technologies is key to our success. Historically, we have relied primarily on hiring experienced employees to meet our demand for talent. Today, we are focused on growing our workforce through university recruiting. University recruiting helps us diversify our talent base, build-out our delivery capabilities and lower our overall delivery costs. Our strategy is to grow our university recruiting program in Mexico, which is one of the top countries in the world in terms of the number of engineering, math and science graduates along with opening offices in other countries in Latin America with similar time zones in order to attract local graduates.
Selectively Pursue Tuck-in Acquisitions
We have historically pursued acquisitions that expanded our services capabilities, vertical expertise and onshore and nearshore footprint. For example, our acquisition of AgileThought in July 2019 expanded our client base and delivery capabilities in the United States and significantly enhanced our consulting, agile coaching, design and agile software development capabilities. We have a track record of successfully identifying and seamlessly integrating acquired companies into our core business. We plan to selectively pursue “tuck-in” transactions in the future that will help us augment our capabilities, establish new and deeper client relationships, and expand our cross-selling opportunities.
Our Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us in the marketplace:
Agile-First Capabilities
We embody an agile-first culture that drives us to provide a range of IT services and business solutions to our clients. By leveraging our AgileThought Scaled Framework and our deep industry expertise, we rapidly and predictably deliver enterprise-level software solutions at scale. We coach our clients, including senior leadership, on the critical role they need to play to enable the successful adoption of agile development practices. Our services span across the entire application lifecycle. We help our clients innovate, build, run and continually improve new technology solutions at scale. 
Domain Expertise in Attractive, High Growth, Large Addressable Markets
We have expertise in industry verticals with large and growing addressable markets for our services. Currently, we have strong expertise in healthcare, professional services, financial services, consumer packaged goods and retail, and industrial services. We focus on verticals where we can leverage our industry knowledge with next-generation technologies to build new technology applications and drive the digital transformation of clients’ technology infrastructure. Many of our executives have direct industry operating experience that allows them to understand the business context and the technology pain points that enterprises encounter.
Customized, Client-Centric Approach
We believe our client-centric approach is a key competitive advantage. We invest in understanding the specific needs and requirements of our clients and tailor our services for them. We believe our customized, hands-on approach allows us to demonstrate our differentiated capabilities and build trust and confidence with new clients and strengthen relationships with current ones, enabling a trusted client advisor relationship status.
Enterprise-Class Expertise in Next-Generation IT Services
Our deep expertise in next-generation technologies facilitates our ability to provide enterprise-class capabilities in key areas of digital transformation. Our expertise extends to technologies in omni-channel commerce and content management, data management, business intelligence (BI), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI). We have built strategic relationships with key vendors in next-generation technologies. We invest in employee training in the latest technologies that are deployed broadly throughout enterprises.
Expertise in Leveraging Existing Technology Systems to Enable Digital Transformation
Digital transformation is a holistic process orchestrating the intersection of next-generation technology, human capital, and a firm’s existing technology investments while unlocking the data siloed therein. By constructing digital platforms that are enriched by existing investments, we are able to rapidly overlay new domain models enabling our client’s workforce to focus on high value work and pivot to new business models not afforded by legacy systems. Tactically, we believe this allows accelerated time to market and encourages a feedback loop informing long term investments. As an organization’s digital strategy evolves, and when justified by business drivers, the legacy applications can be modernized to compete in the new digital ecosystem.
When constructing digital platforms for our clients, we incorporate technologies including telemetry capture, API management, and application insights with legacy technology systems. Telemetry capture allows the platform to understand how it is being utilized by end users and what their experience is. API management allows us to understand application consumption across business units and lines of service. Application insights support platform scaling and predictive consumption models. These cross functional capabilities extend to all components of the digital platform and allow informed business decisions on when and if legacy systems should be modernized and where our client’s future investments will yield the highest return.
By taking a human-first approach to digital transformation, we help our clients maximize existing investments while building an informed strategic future on next-generation technologies.
Values and Culture
Our employees are our greatest asset. We have built a culture of empowerment that allows employees to be entrepreneurial and nimble. This culture, combined with strong and pragmatic management oversight and processes, institutional goals and defined key performance metrics, form the basis of our value system. We believe our culture and value system are paramount to best serving our clients.
The culture we have built allows us to rapidly absorb organizations we acquire by identifying and integrating the best of their processes and empowering their people to grow within our larger organization. We believe our strong culture and overarching values system have led to our successful track record of acquisitions. The ability to assimilate ideas and retain people differentiates us as a potential acquirer for entrepreneurs and employees seeking a larger platform to grow their businesses.

Our extensive history in the banking and financial services industry is part of the foundation of our company. We work with several of the biggest banks in the world and help them with their digital transformation, from online and mobile banking, investment platforms, digital wallets, payment processing, and a suite of other services. 
Healthcare
It is critical to have a sense of trust in your partners within the healthcare industry — the wrong mistake can have real impacts on the lives of real people. That’s why we take pride in our partnerships with some of the largest names in the healthcare industry. They rely on us to have a strong understanding of industry laws & regulations and how we take that into account when creating digital solutions around telemedicine, remote monitoring, electronic health records (EHRs), and patient engagement tools.
Professional Services
The professional services world of audit, advisory, and tax services is a very specialized place, and knowledge of the unique and evolving regulations of global jurisdictions is a must for any partner in the space. We help the professional services world to streamline audit processes and improve accuracy, leveraging machine learning and other advanced technologies to analyze vast amounts of financial data and identify patterns and trends that can help clients optimize their financial performance.

Supply chain management, pricing strategies, seasonal fluctuations, physical storefronts — these are all complex aspects of retail and manufacturing that we believe all benefit from our experience in doing digital transformations in this industry. AgileThought works with some of the world’s top retail brands to elevate customer experiences, build stronger data practices, and increase operational resiliency across value chains.
Our Delivery Model
We use a combination of onshore and nearshore delivery to provide digital transformation services to our clients. We believe our onshore and nearshore model also allows us to quickly travel to our clients’ locations when required. In addition, our ability to collaborate remotely in similar time zones was designed to propel our productivity and further enhances our agile delivery.

Our largest client in 2021 accounted for 13.0% of total revenue. Our second and third largest clients in 2021 accounted for 9.6% and 9.5% of our total revenue, respectively.
Competition
We are a strong provider of digital transformation services in North America. We believe we are well positioned to compete effectively due to our ability to combine our agile-first approach with expertise in next-generation technologies and our clients’ existing technology investments and our onshore and nearshore delivery capabilities. 
Our competitors include:
•Next-generation IT services providers such as Endava Plc, EPAM Systems, Inc., Grid Dynamics and Globant S.A.;
•Large global consulting and traditional global IT services companies such as Accenture plc, Capgemini SE, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, and IBM; and,
•In-house IT and product development departments of our existing and potential clients.
Human Capital and Employees
We strive to foster a culture of empowerment that allows employees to be entrepreneurial and nimble. We provide services from onshore and nearshore delivery locations to facilitate increased interaction, responsiveness and close-proximity collaboration, which are necessary to deliver agile services. As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of 1,692 delivery and consulting employees in Mexico, representing 78.9% of our total of 2,144 delivery and consulting employees. Our onshore delivery centers in the United States employed 181 delivery and consulting employees as of December 31, 2022, and our nearshore delivery centers in Brazil and Argentina employed 240 delivery and consulting employees as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 we had 2,504 employees.
Attract
We recognize that our ability to grow our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain talent and industry-experienced professionals. We have primarily relied on hiring employees with prior relevant experience. We also hire from university campuses. We have leveraged our management team’s extensive knowledge of Mexico in strategically placing our delivery operations in locations such as Merida and Colima that have high concentrations of universities with engineering graduates, attractive cost structure, desirable living attributes and low employee turnover.
Train and Retain
We invest in training our employees and offer regular technical and language training as well as other professional advancement programs. Our training includes programs dedicated to enhance our employees’ abilities and includes language proficiency courses, an Analytics-focused three-week academy and a two-week condensed Agile Boot Camp program. Additionally, during 2020 we launched our “AT University” program, currently ongoing, which is a program that focuses on providing continuous training tools to our employees through online courses and in-house training in both technical and soft-skill topics. These programs not only help ensure our employees are well trained and knowledgeable, but also help enhance employee retention.
We believe our ability to attract and retain talent is further enhanced by our strategic placement of our onshore and nearshore delivery centers in areas that are desirable for employees to live, have ample access to innovative technical and industry-experienced talent pools, and have reduced IT recruiting competition. Additionally, the work-from-home, or WFH, modality that was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic has created two benefits for our ability to attract and retain talent. First, the ability of our distributed teams to effectively WFH for our clients has led us to search for and hire talented professionals outside the cities where we have our delivery centers, providing greater employment opportunities with us to individuals that would otherwise have had to relocate and reducing potential effects on our business from region-related attrition. Second, WFH has also reduced commuting and increased family and personal time for many individuals, which management believes has resulted in higher employee satisfaction which we anticipate translating into higher retention rates.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property is important to our success. We rely on intellectual property laws in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We own or have applied for registration of various trademarks, service marks and trade names that we believe are important to our business.
Despite our efforts to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights, our trademarks, service marks or other intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, declared generic, circumvented, infringed or otherwise violated. Opposition or cancellation proceedings have in the past and may in the future be filed against our trademark or service mark applications and registrations, and our trademarks and service marks may not survive such proceedings. Additionally, although we take reasonable steps to safeguard our trade 
secrets, trade secrets can be difficult to protect, and others may independently discover our trade secrets and other confidential information. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, contractors and other third parties. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of all intellectual property and technology that the applicable counterparties develop in connection with their work for us. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property, trade secrets and proprietary rights. From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others, and we may also be required from time to time to defend against third-party claims of infringement, misappropriation, other violation or invalidity.
Regulations
Due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, Brazil and Argentina. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—We are subject to stringent and changing regulatory, legislative and industry standard developments regarding privacy and data security matters, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.”
