Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Daniels Corporate Advisory creates and implements corporate strategy alternatives for the mini-cap public or private company client. The addition of new business opportunities and the location of professional talent for implementation is anticipated through the full-time efforts of our senior management. These efforts are to be expanded in the United States and in foreign capitals by an expanding advisory board and through the networks of independent consultants. Principals of the respective client company will open their networks to augment professional access for specialties the Daniels corporate strategy consultants believe are needed in a joint-venture, jointly-controlled undertaking created for the client’s optimum growth.
 
Daniels may provide the client with multiple corporate strategies/opportunities including joint-ventures, marketing opportunity agreements and/or potential acquisitions structured in leveraged buyout format. One or a combination of these strategies would allow the client to enter new market niches or expand further into existing ones.
 
Recent Business Developments
 
The Company is operating through the corporate strategy segment of its business. It is attempting to build its own critical mass by creation of start-up subsidiaries it believes have promise/potential. The stated goal is for the parent (DCAC) company to consolidate the critical mass of the subsidiary/start-ups with that of the parent for eventually listing on a major stock exchange. We have continued to focus our efforts on the build out of the Daniels corporate strategy model. We adjusted our strategy as it relates to the development of subsidiary start-ups and potential acquisitions for common stock. We concentrate on identifying projects that have the potential to produce significant earnings on the leveraged capital base of both the parent and the subsidiary/start-up within an expedited time period.
 
As a result, we formed Payless Truckers, Inc. (“Payless”), a wholly-owned subsidiary which was incorporated in the State of Nevada, on April 11, 2018. Payless is a start-up, service company in the trucking industry. It has two business segments with its launch and current results coming from the “flip” segment, whose principal business is to acquire class 8 heavy duty trucks, refurbish them, add location electronics, advertise and sell to independent drivers and operators. The second segment is the “credit rebuilding segment” where class 8 heavy duty trucks, owned by Daniels/Payless, are rented to experienced independent drivers. These independent drivers rent for a period of up to five years, and have the option to buy the vehicle at retail value every six months. This segment commenced operations subsequent to the close of our fiscal year. In an effort to grow quickly and profitably, Daniels entered into an operating agreement with a senior operating management team in an effort to drive the business and better realize its earnings and growth potential.

The Payless two-segment trucking model represents a streamlined trucking service company; one Daniels believes should survive any potential future slow-downs in the economy. The model was developed to allow for the maximum utilization of each truck. The first phase of operations has already been implemented and has covered all the start-up costs plus its own operating expenses.
 
We hope to further enhance our plan for growth beginning in our second year by forming joint-ventures and/or partnerships with truck maintenance companies across the United States in key traffic hubs. This will potentially afford independent drivers and operators the opportunity to be serviced by trusted maintenance facilities under our warranty program.
 
Business Strategy - Current Operational Strategy & Current Client Projects:
 
Daniels creates and implements corporate strategy alternatives for the mini-cap public or private company client. The addition of new business opportunities and the location of professional talent for implementation is anticipated through the full-time efforts of our senior management. These efforts are to be expanded in the US and in Foreign capitals by an expanding advisory board and through the networks of independent consultants. Principals of the respective client company will open their networks to augment professional access for specialties the Daniels corporate strategy consultants believe are needed in a joint venture, (jointly-controlled) undertaking created for the client’s optimum growth.
 
Daniels may provide the client with multiple corporate strategies /opportunities including joint-ventures, marketing opportunity agreements and/or potential acquisitions structured in a leveraged buyout format. One or a combination of these strategies would allow the client to enter new market niches or expand further into existing ones.
 
The Goal: A major exchange listing. Senior management is estimating at least twenty-four months from commencement of a corporate strategy assignment. Financial results, aided by all participating players, should be forthcoming and recorded in SEC filings. At the same time, a senior management team and Board expanded with highly-credible interim (or permanent) professionals (directors) will be organized in order to successfully navigate the listing process of a major stock exchange. While Daniels believes this process should be successful in the above-noted time period, there is some uncertainty in the process which is dependent upon any past issues the listing committee of a specific exchange may deem necessary to be addressed prior to uplifting. In addition, it may take added time to find the appropriate outside directors that can not only satisfy the listing committee of the exchange but who can also provide added networking/services to build the parent’s and subsidiary’s potential for accelerated growth.
 
A similar effort will be provided to tailor an optimum growth program for the private company client, whether it chooses to remain private or to become a public company through alternative merger opportunities.
 
OPTIMUM GROWTH STRATEGY:
 
Twenty-Four Month Horizons for Daniels’ Objectives:
 
Daniels’ believes that the validity of its corporate strategy model will be proven further through the success of its initial subsidiary incubation, Payless Truckers, Inc. The growing momentum of this cash flow engine should generate the interest of long-term financing sources that will realize upfront that debt service can/ will be covered. This “collective approach” to growth should provide several initial seed capital sources for other startup subsidiaries or the acquisition and joint-development of early stage companies. Daniels plans to use its publicly traded common stock in a variety of securities packages, including convertible preferred stock, to launch promising subsidiary start-ups, initially for generic sales/profits growth. Subsequent growth options noted above will be applied as external growth becomes a secondary goal. This method of two stage (generic and then external) growth is designed to leave existing client management with commanding equity and operating control positions. Eventually, an optimum exit strategy will be developed for the subsidiary, one that returns a significant return on corporate (parent) capital. The choices of optimum exit strategies could include bringing a subsidiary public, directly through a spin-off strategy, or merging it with an exchange listed public company that requires added critical mass. This infusion of cash flow and profits will allow expansion in one of the more profitable niches of any market designated for expansion. The same corporate strategy model can/will be applied to any independent mini-cap public client.

Senior management believes our corporate strategy business model to be scalable. Based upon the potential success of the initial corporate strategy consulting assignments creating our uplifting to a major stock exchange, Daniels may entertain the creation of a franchising plan for key US cities and foreign capitals or finance centers.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Daniels senior management will concentrate its efforts to expand its corporate strategy and financial advisory services and related specialties in the mini-cap segment of the private and public markets, where Daniels believes it will be effective. Marketing efforts will increase through social and print media efforts and will be in addition to those methods already mentioned herein.
 
Daniels objective is to create and help manage implementation of accelerated expansion strategies and in so doing, aid in the creation of financing alternatives to accomplish client goals.
 
Competition
 
Existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive price and performance characteristics.
 
In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to meet competition or maintain prices and choose only those assignments with new clients that have pressing goals to be met that offer Daniels optimum potential for profits and growth.
 
The “collective” corporate financial services, direct and referral, including merchant banking/private equity, are very competitive and fragmented in the Company’s market niche. There are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market. A significant number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources. We are and will continue to offer equity compensation to our team of advisory board members, and independent strategy consultants in order to keep a stable, cohesive team of professionals, which is necessary and key to the creation of operating and capital solutions in a timely fashion.
