 Overview 
 Repligen is a leading provider of advanced bioprocessing technologies and solutions used in the process of manufacturing biologic drugs. Our products are made to substantially increase biopharmaceutical manufacturing efficiencies and flexibility. As the global biologics market continues to experience strong growth and expansion, our customers  primarily large biopharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturing organizations  face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures that our products are made to address. Our commitment to bioprocessing is helping to set new standards for the way our customers manufacture biologic drugs, including monoclonal antibodies (mAb), recombinant proteins, vaccines and gene therapies. We are dedicated to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of biologic drugs that improve human health worldwide. 
 We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biologic drug manufacturing. Building on over 35 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our commitment to build a best-in-class bioprocessing technology company with a world-class direct sales and commercial organization. 
 We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities and maximizing the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and commercial leverage) and targeted acquisitions. 
 Our Products 
 Our bioprocessing business is comprised of three main product lines  Chromatography, Filtration and Proteins. 
 Direct-to-Customer Products (Chromatography and Filtration) 
 Since 2012, we have significantly expanded our direct-to-customer presence through our Chromatography and Filtration product lines, which include differentiated products and systems. We have diversified and grown our direct-to-customer product offering through internal innovation and through disciplined, accretive acquisitions of assets or businesses that leverage existing product lines and/or expand our customer and geographic scope. 
 To support our sales goals for our direct-to-consumer products, we have invested in our commercial organization. Our commercial and research and development teams work to effectively launch new products and applications, as well as build new markets for acquired technologies that increase flexibility and convenience while streamlining biomanufacturing workflow for our customers. In addition, to meet increased demand for our products, we continue to invest in increasing the volume and scale of manufacturing at our facilities in the United States, Sweden and Germany.

 Chromatography 
 Our Chromatography product line includes a number of products used in the downstream purification and quality control of biological drugs. The main driver of growth in this portfolio is our lab and process-scale OPUS® pre-packed chromatography (PPC) column line. 
 Our other products include chromatography resins (such as CaptivA®) used in a small number of commercial drug processes and ELISA test kits used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A and/or growth factor in the final product. 
 OPUS®
Our Chromatography product line features PPC columns under our OPUS brand. OPUS columns, which we deliver to our customers pre-packed with their choice of chromatography resin, are single-campaign (single-use) disposable columns that replace the use of traditional and more permanent glass columns used in downstream purification processes. By designing OPUS to be a technologically advanced and flexible option for the purification of biologics from process development through clinical-scale and some commercial manufacturing, Repligen has become a leader in the PPC market. The customization and ready-to-use nature of our OPUS columns makes them ideal for purification of antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines. Biomanufacturers value the time savings, labor and utility cost savings, product consistency and the plug and play convenience of OPUS. 
 We launched our first production-scale OPUS columns in 2012 and have since added larger diameter options such as OPUS 45 and OPUS 60. Early in 2018, we introduced OPUS 80 R, the largest available PPC on the market, for use in late-stage clinical or select commercial purification processes. We have also introduced next-generation features such as a resin recovery port on our larger columns. This allows our customers to reuse the recovered resin in other applications. The unpacking port feature was made available in the first quarter of 2017 on our largest production-scale OPUS columns. 
 Through our acquisition of Atoll GmbH in 2016, we established a customer-facing center in Europe and expanded our portfolio to include our smaller-scale columns, named OPUS PD, that are used in high-throughput process development screening, viral validation studies and scale down validation of chromatography processes. We maintain a broad and customizable PPC product line to meet our customers diverse needs. 
 Other Chromatography 
 Also included in our Chromatography portfolio are ELISA kits, which are analytical test kits to detect the presence of proteins and growth factors, and chromatography resins, including our CaptivA® brand. In addition, following our acquisition of Spectrum in 2017, we sell Spectra/Chrom® liquid chromatography products as part of our Chromatography product line. 
 Filtration 
 XCell ATF 
 Our Filtration products offer a number of advantages to manufacturers of biologic drugs at volumes that span from pilot studies to clinical and commercial-scale production. We first established our Filtration product line through our acquisition of XCell Alternating Tangential Flow (ATF) assets from Refine Technology (Refine) in 2014. XCell ATF systems are used primarily in upstream perfusion, or continuous manufacturing, processes.

 XCell ATF is a technologically advanced filtration device used in upstream processes to continuously remove cellular metabolic waste products during the course of a fermentation run, freeing healthy cells to continue producing the biologic drug of interest. XCell ATF was designed to both increase the density of cells in a bioreactor and extend the production run. By continuously removing waste products from the fermenter, the XCell ATF System routinely increases cell densities to 2- or 3-times the levels achieved by standard batch fermentation. As a result, product yield is increased, which improves facility utilization and can reduce the size of a bioreactor required to manufacture a given volume of biologic drug product. This is important to biomanufacturers who seek to maximize output from their existing facilities. XCell ATF Systems are suitable for use in laboratory and scale-up all the way to production bioreactors as large as 2,000 liters. 
 Through internal innovation, we developed and in 2016 launched single-use formats of the original stainless steel XCell ATF device to address increasing industry demand for plug-and-play technology. The XCell ATF device is now available to customers in both its original configuration (steel housing and replaceable filters) in all sizes (2, 4, 6 and 10), and/or as a single-use device (disposable housing/filter combination) in most sizes (2, 6, and 10). The availability of XCell ATF in a single-use format eliminates the pre-use workflow associated with autoclaving, leading to an 80% reduction in implementation time. The single-use format also enables our customers to accelerate evaluations of the product with a lower initial overall cost of ownership. Based on strong demand, we have continued to expand the single-use XCell ATF offering. 
 In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with industry leader Sartorius Stedim Biotech (SSB) to integrate our XCell ATF controller technology into SSBs BIOSTAT® STR large-scale, single-use bioreactors, to create novel perfusion-enabled bioreactors. 
 SIUS Tangential Flow Filters (TangenX) 
 In December 2016, we acquired TangenX Technology Corporation (TangenX), balancing our upstream XCell ATF offering with a downstream portfolio of flat-sheet tangential flow filters (TFF) and cassettes used in downstream biologic drug purification and formulation processes. The TangenX portfolio includes our single-use SIUS TFF brand, providing customers with a high-performance, low-cost alternative to reusable TFF cassettes. 
 TFF is a rapid and efficient method for separation and purification of biomolecules that is widely used in laboratory, process development and process scale applications in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. SIUS is an innovative single-use TFF line of cassettes and hardware for lab-scale through large-scale biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Single-use SIUS TFF cassettes with enclosed flat sheet membranes are designed to provide a high performing membrane at significantly lower product and labor costs than reusable TFF products. Each disposable cassette is delivered pre-sanitized, integrity tested and ready to be equilibrated and used for tangential flow diafiltration and ultrafiltration processing. Use of SIUS TFF cassettes eliminates non-value added steps of cleaning and flushing required in reusable TFF products. The cassettes are interchangeable with filter hardware from multiple manufacturers, simplifying customer trial and adoption of SIUS products. 
 KrosFlo®, ProConnex® (Spectrum Life Sciences LLC) 
 We acquired Spectrum Life Sciences LLC (Spectrum) and its subsidiaries in August 2017 to strengthen our filtration business with the addition of a leading portfolio of hollow-fiber (HF) filters and modules, single-use flow path connectors and TFF filtration systems. Spectrum products are used in bench-top through commercial-scale processes, primarily for the filtration, isolation, purification and concentration of biologics and diagnostic products. Our Spectrum filtration products offer both standard and customized solutions to bioprocessing customers, with particular strength in consumable and single-use offerings. 
 With the addition of Spectrum, we now in-house manufacture hollow-fiber filters that can be used in our XCell ATF system. In addition, we increased our direct sales presence in Europe and Asia, and we diversified our end markets beyond monoclonal antibodies to include vaccines, recombinant protein and gene therapies. 
 

4 


 Our Spectrum filtration brands include the KrosFlo® line of hollow-fiber cartridges and TFF systems, the Spectra/Por® portfolio of laboratory and process dialysis products and Pro-Connex® single-use hollow-fiber Module-Bag-Tubing sets. 
 In 2018, we introduced our KONDUiT device to automate concentration and buffer exchange to be used in conjunction with our hollow fiber or flat sheet TFF filtration products. 
 OEM Products (Proteins) 
 Our OEM products are represented by our Protein A affinity ligands, which are a critical component of Protein A chromatography resins used in downstream purification, and cell culture growth factor products, which are a key component of cell culture media used upstream to increase cell density in a bioreactor and improve product yield. 
 Protein A/Ligands 
 We are a leading provider of Protein A affinity ligands to life sciences companies. Protein A ligands are an essential binding component of Protein A chromatography resins used in the purification of virtually all monoclonal antibody based drugs on the market or in development. We manufacture multiple forms of Protein A ligands under long-term supply agreements with major life sciences companies including GE Healthcare, MilliporeSigma and Purolite Life Sciences (Purolite), who in turn sell their Protein A chromatography resins to end users (mAb manufacturers). We have two manufacturing sites supporting overall global demand for our Protein A ligands: one in Lund, Sweden and another in Waltham, Massachusetts. 
 Protein A chromatography resins are considered the industry standard for purification of antibody-based therapeutics due to the ability of the Protein A ligand to very selectively bind to or capture antibodies from crude protein mixtures. Protein A resins are packed into the first chromatography column of typically three columns used in a mAb purification process. As a result of Protein As high affinity for antibodies, the mAb product is highly purified and concentrated within this first capture step before moving to polishing steps. 
 In June 2018, we entered into an agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH (Navigo) for the exclusive co-development of multiple affinity ligands for which Repligen holds commercialization rights. We are manufacturing and have agreed to supply the first of these ligands, NGL-Impact A, exclusively to Purolite, who will pair our high-performance ligand with Purolites agarose jetting base bead technology used in their Jetted A50 Protein A resin product. We also signed a long-term supply agreement with Purolite for NGL-Impact A and potential additional affinity ligands that may advance from our Navigo collaboration. The Navigo and Purolite agreements are supportive of our strategy to secure and reinforce our Proteins product line. 
 Growth Factors 
 Most biopharmaceuticals are produced through an upstream mammalian cell fermentation process. In order to stimulate increased cell growth and maximize overall yield from a bioreactor, manufacturers often add growth factors, such as insulin, to their cell culture fermentation media. As part of the Novozymes Acquisition in 2011, we gained several cell culture growth factor additives. Among those products is LONG®R3 IGF-1, our insulin-like growth factor that has been shown to be up to 100 times more biologically potent than insulin (the industry standard), thereby increasing recombinant protein production in cell culture fermentation applications. LONG R3 IGF-1 is sold through a distribution partnership with MilliporeSigma. 
 Corporate Information 
 We are a Delaware corporation with global headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. We were incorporated in 1981 and became a publicly traded company in 1986. Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market 
 
5 


  under the symbol RGEN. We have over 540 employees and operate globally with offices and manufacturing sites located at multiple locations in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our principal executive offices are located at 41 Seyon Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453, our website is www.repligen.com and our telephone number is (781) 250-0111.
Our Market Opportunity 
 The global biologics drug market was estimated to be over $200 billion in 2017. This market includes therapeutic antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines. Antibody-based biologics alone accounted for over $115 billion of global biopharma revenue and represented a majority of the top 10 best-selling drugs across the pharmaceutical industry in 2017. Industry sources project the biologics market to grow at a rate of 8%-10% annually over the next five years, driven by strength in the mAb class of biologics, as evidenced by the rate of new approvals, expanded labels for marketed antibodies and the emergence of biosimilar versions of originator mAbs. 
 In 2018, 13 mAbs (a record 11 originator mAbs and two biosimilars) were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a diverse range of diseases. Between 2016 and 2018, 36 mAbs were approved by the FDA, representing over 40% of all approved mAbs since the first therapeutic antibody was brought to market in 1986. There are currently more than 80 mAbs on the market and more than 400 in various stages of clinical development addressing a wide range of medical conditions including asthma, migraines and Alzheimers disease. 
 In addition to investments in the discovery and development of novel biologic drugs, there has been substantial investment in follow-on products (biosimilars) by generic and specialty pharmaceutical as well as large biopharmaceutical companies. Development of follow-on products has accelerated as the first major mAbs have come off patent in the European Union and United States. Due to the high cost of biologic drugs, many countries in the developing and emerging markets have been aggressively investing in biomanufacturing capabilities to supply lower cost biosimilars for the local markets. For both originator and follow-on biologics manufacturing, Repligen products are well-positioned to enable greater manufacturing flexibility, production yields and lower costs through improved process efficiencies. 
 Many of the products we manufacture are in the early stages of their adoption cycle, and together with the expansion of our commercial organization and strategic acquisitions, have contributed to product revenue growth from $47.5 million in 2013, to $193.9 million in 2018. While all product lines have grown over this period, our diversification strategy has resulted in a significant increase in direct product sales as a percent of total product revenue, from 17% in 2012. By 2018, 72% of total bioprocessing revenue was attributable to direct product sales; 47% from our Filtration product line, 23% from our Chromatography product line and a small percentage from other sources including sales of hospital products that we obtained through our acquisition of Spectrum. 
 Customers use our products to produce initial quantities of drug for clinical studies, and then scale-up to larger volumes as the drug progresses to commercial production following regulatory approval. Detailed specifications for a drugs manufacturing process are included in applications that must be approved by regulators, such as the FDA, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), throughout the clinical trial process and prior to final commercial approval. As a result, products that become part of the manufacturing specifications of a late-stage clinical or commercial process can be very sensitive given the costs and uncertainties associated with displacing them. 
 The Biologics Manufacturing Process 
 Manufacturing biologic drugs requires three fundamental steps. First, upstream manufacturing involves the production of the biologic by living cells that are grown in a bioreactor under controlled conditions. Methods of production vary with the industry standard being fed-batch, where nutrients (media) are added to a bioreactor to 
 
6 


  stimulate cell growth and productivity and then followed by a harvest step. The industry is increasingly adopting the perfusion (or continuous) method of production, which circulates nutrients into the bioreactor, while simultaneously harvesting the biologic drug product. Some manufacturers are embracing a hybrid approach combining both fed-batch and perfusion methods. The cells being grown in a bioreactor are engineered to produce the biologic drugs of interest. These tiny cell factories are highly sensitive to the conditions under which they grow, including the composition of the cell culture media and the growth factors used to stimulate increased cell growth and protein production, or titre. In the second downstream step, the biologic made upstream must be separated and purified, typically through various filtration and chromatography steps. Finally, the purified biologic drug is concentrated and formulated and then quality controlled and packaged into its final injectable form. 
 Biologics are generally high value therapies. Given the inherent complexities of the process and the final drug product, we have observed that manufacturers are seeking and investing in innovative technologies that address pressure points in the production process in order to improve yields. Manufacturers are also seeking technologies that reduce costs as the biologic drug moves through clinical stages and into commercial processes by adopting single-use technologies as well as other products that yield increased flexibility and efficiency. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are focused on the development, production and commercialization of differentiated, technology-leading solutions or products that address specific pressure points in the biologics manufacturing process and deliver substantial value to our customers. Our products are designed to increase our customers product yield, and we are committed to supporting our customers with strong customer service and applications expertise. 
 We intend to build on our recent history of developing market-leading solutions and delivering strong financial performance through the following strategies: 
 

 | Continued innovation. We plan to capitalize on our internal technological expertise to develop products that address unmet needs in upstream and downstream bioprocessing. We intend to invest further in our core Proteins product lines while developing platform and derivative products to support our Filtration and Chromatography product lines.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Platforming our products. A key strategy for accelerating market adoption of our products is delivery of enabling technologies that become the standard, or platform, technology in markets where we compete. We focus our efforts on winning early-stage technology evaluations through direct interaction with the key biomanufacturing decision makers in process development labs. This strategy is designed to establish early adoption of our enabling technologies at key accounts, with opportunity for customers to scale up as the molecule advances to later stages of development and potential commercialization. We believe this approach can accelerate the implementation of our products as platform products, thereby strengthening our competitive advantage and contributing to long-term growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Targeted acquisitions. We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of innovative technologies and products. We intend to leverage our balance sheet to acquire technologies and products that improve our overall financial performance by improving our competitiveness in filtration or chromatography or moving us into adjacent markets with common commercial call points.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Geographical expansion. We intend to expand our global commercial presence by continuing to selectively build out our global sales, marketing, field applications and services infrastructure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Operational efficiency. We seek to expand operating margins through capacity utilization and process optimization strategies designed to increase our manufacturing yields. We plan to invest in systems to support our global operations, optimizing resources across our global footprint to maximize productivity.

 Research and Development 
 Our research activities are focused on developing new high-value bioprocessing products. Specifically, we plan to focus these efforts on expanding our product portfolio and applications for our OPUS PPC columns, XCell ATF systems, SIUS TFF, KrosFlo®, TFF systems and other products, and developing next generation Protein A ligands. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing strategy supports our objective of strengthening our position as a leading provider of products and services, addressing upstream, downstream and quality control needs of bioprocessing customers in the biopharmaceutical industry. 
 Direct-to-Customer Team 
 To support our sales goals for our direct-to-consumer products, we have invested in our commercial organization. Since 2014, we have significantly expanded our global commercial organization, to form a 103-person commercial team as of December 31, 2018. This includes 54 people in field positions (direct sales, field applications and field service), and 49 people with internal positions (marketing, product management and customer service). This expansion also includes the team of 26 highly experienced field personnel that we added with our acquisition of Spectrum in 2017. With the acquisition, we have greatly expanded our direct sales team in Asia, where we also work effectively with key distributors to serve our expanding customer base.
 As part of the Spectrum integration process, we transitioned to a new sales model in 2018, whereby all sales staff now represent all Repligen products across our Chromatography and Filtration portfolios. Our bioprocess account managers are supported in each region by bioprocess sales specialists with expertise in either Filtration or Chromatography and by technically trained field applications specialists and field service providers, who can work closely with customers on product demonstrations, implementation and support. We believe that this model helps drive further adoption at our key accounts and also open up new sales opportunities within each region. 
 OEM Agreements 
 For our Proteins product line, we are committed to being a partner of choice for our customers with distributor and supply agreements in place with large life sciences companies such as GE Healthcare, MilliporeSigma and Purolite. The GE Healthcare Protein A supply agreement relating to our Lund, Sweden facility runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2019 with an option for earlier termination on six months advance notice. The GE Healthcare Protein A supply agreement relating to our Waltham, Massachusetts facility runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2021. Our Protein A supply agreement with MilliporeSigma runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2023, and in 2018 we amended our Protein A supply agreement with Purolite that runs, pursuant to its terms, to August 2026 with an option for renewal through 2028. Our dual manufacturing capability provides strong business continuity and reduces overall supply risk for our OEM customers.

We continually seek to improve upon these technologies and have multiple new patent filings including those covering pumps and controllers, methods of harvesting, single-use products, and filters. Our patent for alternating tangential flow and associated methods to use such a device in perfusion, acquired from Refine, expires in 2020, and we are proactively developing technology in an effort to mitigate any effects resulting from the expiration of this patent. 
 
9 


 We currently have 44 patents granted (which expire over the next 20 years) and 85 patents pending in countries including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States. 
 Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants, business partners, potential collaborators and major customers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment, consulting, business relationship, or product related audit with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the other party during the course of the relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to Repligen shall be our exclusive property and must be assigned to Repligen. 
 Protein A 
 We currently hold a patent for Nucleic Acids Encoding Recombinant Protein A, which claims an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a Protein A molecule with an amino acid sequence identical to that of the natural Protein A, which has long been commercialized for bioprocessing applications. This patent will remain in effect until June 2028. We also have two pending patents covering affinity ligands through our collaboration with Navigo GmbH.

 We vigilantly protect our products and services branding by maintaining trademark registrations globally for the Repligen trademark and our key product brands. We have a comprehensive branding policy that includes trademark usage guidelines to ensure Repligen trademarks are used in a manner that provides the maximum protection. 
 We prioritize our housemark trademarks, (i.e., Repligen, Spectrum and TangenX), and ensure they are sufficiently protected and registered in key countries or regions globally, such as the United States, Canada, Europe and China. We also have product trademarks, including OPUS, XCell ATF, KrosFlo, SIUS, Pro-Connex, Spectra/Por and NGL-Impact A, that provide valuable company recognition and goodwill with its customers. 
 Our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace is dependent in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which includes protecting the trademarks we use in connection with our products and services. We rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand.
 Licensing Agreements 
 We have entered into multiple licensing and collaboration relationships with third-party business partners in an effort to fully exploit our technology and advance our bioprocessing business strategy. 
Competition 
 Our bioprocessing products compete on the basis of quality, performance, cost effectiveness, and application suitability with numerous established technologies. Additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may also be introduced. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products, which in some cases include GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, our two largest customers, have greater financial and human resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience than we do. They may undertake their own development of products that are substantially similar to or compete with 
 
10 


  our products and they may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing and commercialization activities. We cannot be certain that the research, development and commercialization efforts of our competitors will not render any of our existing or potential products obsolete. 
 Manufacturing 
 We manufacture seven commercial forms of Protein A, including native Protein A for life sciences companies, including GE Healthcare, MilliporeSigma and Purolite, under long-term supply agreements which expire between 2019 and 2023. Native Protein A is manufactured in Lund, Sweden, while the recombinant forms are manufactured in both Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden. We currently manufacture our growth factor products in Lund, Sweden. Our OPUS chromatography columns and XCell ATF System products are manufactured in Waltham, Massachusetts. Our OPUS PD columns are manufactured in Ravensburg, Germany, and our SIUS TFF products were manufactured in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts until December 31, 2018 before manufacturing of the SIUS TFF products shifted to our new facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts. Our KrosFlo, Spectra/Pro and Pro-Connex lines of products are manufactured in Rancho Dominguez, California. Our operating room products are manufactured in Irving, Texas, and our Spectra/Chrom products are manufactured in Houston, Texas. 
 We utilize our own facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden as well as third-party contract manufacturing organizations to carry out certain fermentation and recovery operations, while the purification, immobilization, packaging and quality control testing of our bioprocessing products are conducted at our facilities. Our facilities located in Waltham, Massachusetts; Lund, Sweden; Ravensburg, Germany; and Rancho Dominguez, California are ISO 9001:2015 certified and maintain formal quality systems to maintain process control, traceability, and product conformance. Additionally, our facility in Irving, Texas is ISO 13485:2012 certified. We practice continuous improvement initiatives based on routine internal audits as well as external feedback and audits performed by our partners and customers.
