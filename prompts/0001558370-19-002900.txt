Forward-looking statements include statements concerning business strategy, among other things, including anticipated trends and developments in and management plans for our business and the markets in which we operate. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words, such as “estimate,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “forecast,” “foresee,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “goal,” “target,” “might,” “will,” "would," "can,"  “could,” “predict,” and “continue,” the negative or plural of these words and other comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are based upon information available to us as of the filing date of this Form 10-K, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. These factors include the matters discussed under “Risk Factors” in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 and those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and from time to time in future reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K.
     In this Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, “Legacy,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Legacy Housing Corporation, a Delaware corporation.
 Our Company
 We build, sell and finance manufactured homes and “tiny houses” that are distributed through a network of independent retailers and company‑owned stores and also sold directly to manufactured home communities. The company was founded in 2005 as a Texas limited partnership named Legacy Housing, Ltd. Effective January 1, 2018, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Legacy Housing Corporation. Our corporate office is located in Bedford, Texas (between Dallas and Fort Worth). We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in December 2018 and our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “LEGH.” 
 We are the fourth largest producer of manufactured homes in the United States as ranked by number of homes manufactured based on information available from the Manufactured Housing Institute and IBTS for the second quarter of 2018. With current operations focused primarily in the southern United States, we offer our customers an array of quality homes ranging in size from approximately 390 to 2,667 square feet consisting of 1 to 5 bedrooms, with 1 to 31/2 bathrooms. Our homes range in price, at retail, from approximately $22,000 to $95,000. During 2018, we sold 3,950 home sections (which are entire modules or single floors) and in 2017 we sold 3,274 home sections. We commenced operations in 2005 and have experienced strong sales growth and increased our equity holders’ capital at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 28% between 2009 and 2018. We have experienced steady growth since our inception. 
 Our homes address the significant need in the United States for affordable housing. This need for affordable housing is being driven by a nationwide trend of increasing rental rates for housing, higher prices for site‑built homes and decreasing percentages of home ownership among portions of the U.S. population. Our customers typically have annual household incomes of less than $60,000 and include young and working class families, as well as persons age 55 and older. In 2016, there were approximately 63,799,000 households in the United States with annual household incomes of less than $60,000, representing a majority of all U.S. households, according to the Current Population Survey and 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement published by the U.S. Census Bureau.
 We believe our company is one of the most vertically integrated in the manufactured housing industry, allowing us to offer a complete solution to our customers, from manufacturing custom‑made homes using quality materials and distributing those homes through our expansive network of independent retailers and company‑owned distribution

locations, to providing tailored financing solutions for our customers. Our homes are constructed in the United States at one of our three manufacturing facilities in accordance with the construction and safety standards of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). Our factories employ high‑volume production techniques that allow us to produce approximately 75 home sections, or approximately 62 fully‑completed homes on average depending on product mix, in total per week. We use quality materials and operate our own component manufacturing facilities for many of the items used in the construction of our homes. Each home can be configured according to a variety of floor plans and equipped with such features as fireplaces, central air conditioning and state‑of‑the‑art kitchens.
 Our homes are marketed under our premier “Legacy” brand name and, as of December 31, 2018, are sold to consumers, primarily across 15 states through a network of 114 independent retail locations, 12 company‑owned retail locations and through direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. Our 12 company‑owned retail locations, including ten Heritage Housing stores and two Tiny House Outlet stores, exclusively sell our homes. During 2018, approximately 56% of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 13% in Georgia, 11% in Louisiana and 4% in Oklahoma. During 2017, approximately 62% of our manufactured homes were sold in Texas, followed by 8% in Georgia, 8% in Colorado, 5% in Oklahoma, and 4% in Louisiana. We plan to deepen our distribution channel by using a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to expand our company‑owned retail locations in new and existing markets.
 We offer three types of financing solutions to our customers. We provide floor plan financing for our independent retailers, which takes the form of a consignment arrangement between the retailer and us. We also provide consumer financing for our products which are sold to end‑users through both independent and company‑owned retail locations, and we provide financing solutions to manufactured housing community owners that buy our products for use in their housing communities. Our ability to offer competitive financing options at our retail locations provides us with several competitive advantages and allows us to capture sales that may not have otherwise occurred without the ability to offer consumer financing.
 Corporate Conversion
 Prior to January 1, 2018, we were a Texas limited partnership named Legacy Housing, Ltd. Effective January 1, 2018, we converted into a Delaware corporation pursuant to a statutory conversion, or the corporate conversion, and changed our name to Legacy Housing Corporation. All of our outstanding partnership interests were converted on a proportional basis into shares of common stock of Legacy Housing Corporation. The conversion qualified as a tax free transaction under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
 Following the corporate conversion, Legacy Housing Corporation continues to hold all of the property and assets of Legacy Housing, Ltd. and all of the debts and obligations of Legacy Housing, Ltd. continue as the debts and obligations of Legacy Housing Corporation. The purpose of the corporate conversion was to reorganize our corporate structure so that the top‑tier entity in our corporate structure, the entity that offered common stock to the public in the IPO, was a corporation rather than a limited partnership. Except as otherwise noted, the financial statements included in this Form 10-K are those of Legacy Housing Corporation.
 Our Market Opportunity
 Manufactured housing is a competitive alternative to other forms of affordable housing, whether new or existing, or located in urban, suburban or rural areas. We believe the target universe of manufactured home buyers consists of households with total annual income below $60,000 which comprised a majority of total U.S. households in 2016. We believe our target U.S. age groups consist of young families between the ages of 20‑39 and persons age 50 and older. These age groups have grown significantly since 2007. The comparatively low all‑in cost of fully‑equipped manufactured housing is attractive to our target consumers. The chart below highlights the increasing all‑in average sales price per square foot difference between a new manufactured home and a new site‑built home (excluding land).

 Additionally, innovative engineering and design, as well as efficient production techniques, including the advent and development of the “tiny house” market, continue to position manufactured homes as a viable housing alternative. Demand for high‑quality affordable housing below $150,000 has also been driven by increasing rental rates

 In 2017, the manufactured housing industry shipped 92,891 manufactured homes according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Institute for Building Technology and Safety (“IBTS”) and the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”). Total annualized manufactured home shipments during the first half of 2018 increased to

 Our Competitive Advantages
 We offer a complete solution for affordable manufactured housing. We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competition and have been able to grow our business as a result of the following key competitive strengths:
· | Quality and Variety of Housing Designs. Based on more than 60 combined years of industry experience, our co‑founders have developed an operating model that enables the efficient production of quality, customizable manufactured homes. All of our homes are constructed in one of our three U.S.‑based manufacturing facilities. By utilizing an assembly‑line process that employs from approximately 150 to 275 individuals per facility, we are able to manufacture a home in approximately three to six days and, are on average producing approximately 75 home sections, or 62 fully‑completed homes depending on product mix, in total per week. We utilize local market research to design homes that meet the specific needs of our customers and offer a variety of structural and decorative customization options, including, among others, fireplaces, central air conditioning, overhead heat ducts, stipple‑textured ceilings, decorative woodgrain vinyl floors, wood cabinetry and energy conservation elements. Additionally, our homes have vaulted ceilings in every room, have numerous proprietary advantages such as our copyrighted “furniture friendly” floor plans and, in most cases, are wider, have taller ceilings and a steeper roof pitch than our competitors’ products. Taken together, we believe our ability to offer our customers a range of home sizes and styles, as well as sophisticated design and customization, allows us to accommodate virtually all reasonable customer requests. Our vertical integration allows us the ability to respond quickly to our customers’ needs and modify designs during the construction process.

· | Manufacturing Facilities Strategically Located Near Customers in Key Markets. Our three manufacturing facilities are strategically located to allow us to serve our 114 independent and 12 company‑owned retail locations primarily across 15 states. Currently, we have a manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas that measures 97,000 square feet in size and produced 1,133 homes in 2018 and 1,073 homes in 2017, a manufacturing plant in Commerce, Texas that measures 130,000 square feet in size and

produced 987 homes in 2018 and 1,077 homes in 2017, and a manufacturing plant in Eatonton, Georgia that measures 388,000 square feet in size and produced 1,000 homes in 2018 and 744 homes in 2017. Once our homes are constructed and equipped at our facilities, we have the ability to transport the finished products directly to customers ensuring timely and efficient delivery of our manufactured homes. We currently have approximately 35 company‑owned trucks, which transported approximately 35% of our production during 2018 to manufactured home communities and our company-owned retail locations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expansive and Growing Distribution Network. We distribute our products primarily in the southern United States through a network of independent retail locations, company‑owned retail locations and direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. Our first company‑owned retail location opened in June 2016 and we plan to significantly expand our company‑owned retail footprint over the next two years. Increasing the mix of company‑owned locations allows us to improve the customer experience through all the steps of the buying process, from manufacturing and design to sales, financing and customer service. We believe our company‑owned stores will, on average, be more productive than our independent retail locations and carry higher gross margins. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competitive Production Strategies and Direct Sourcing. We develop and maintain the resources necessary to efficiently build custom homes that incorporate unique and varied customer‑requested features. We are constantly seeking ways in which to directly source materials to be used in the manufacturing process, which allows us to ensure the materials are of high‑quality and can be customized to meet our customers’ needs. Customization enables us to attract additional retailers and consumers who seek individualized homes that are assembled on a factory production line. When these custom homes are sold through company‑owned retail stores, we expect to capture higher gross margins. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Available Financing for our Customers. Our financial position allows us to develop and offer financing solutions to our customers in connection with their purchase of our homes. We offer three types of financing solutions to our customers. We provide floor plan financing for our independent retailers, which takes the form of a consignment arrangement between the retailer and us. We also provide consumer financing for our products sold to end‑users through both independent and our company‑owned retail locations, and we provide financing to community owners that buy our products for use in their rental housing communities. Our company has been providing floor plan financing to our independent retailers since our formation and we now have more than 75 independent retailers using our consignment solution. We now have more than 3,000 customers that purchased their homes utilizing our retail financing solutions. The average interest rates of our retail financing loans was approximately 14.0% at December 31, 2018 and approximately 13.9% at December 31, 2017. The repossession rates for our retail financing loans, measured by units, was approximately 2.3% and 2.6% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Support for Owners of Manufactured Home Communities. We provide manufacturing and financing solutions for owners of manufactured home communities in connection with the development of communities in our geographic market area. Such development projects can vary, but generally include custom park development financing and large purchase orders of manufactured homes. We also make loans to community owners for the purpose of acquiring or developing properties and, as part of the arrangement, these community owners contract to buy homes from us. These loans typically range in term from two to five years and carry interest at 8% to 12%. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had provided additional loans to owners of manufactured home communities for lot development purposes with a total amount outstanding of $1,077,000 and $2,032,000, respectively. These financing solutions are structured to give us an attractive return on investment, when coupled with the gross margin we realize on products specifically targeted for these new manufactured housing communities.

· | Strong Alignment of Interests through Co‑Founders’ Ownership. We believe that a strong alignment of interests with stockholders and investors exists through the ownership of a significant percentage of our outstanding shares by our co-founders, Curtis D. Hodgson (executive Chairman of the Board) and Kenneth E. Shipley (President and Chief Executive Officer). Messrs. Hodgson and Shipley acquired their ownership in 2005 when they founded the company and have not sold any of their shares to date. Each individual has 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and continues to receive a minimal annual salary ($50,000). By providing structural and economic alignment with the performance of our company, Messrs. Hodgson’s and Shipley’s continuing controlling interests are directly aligned with those of our investors. We believe the combination of these characteristics has promoted long‑term planning, an enhanced culture among our customers, strategic partners and employees, and ultimately the creation of value for our investors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Growth Strategy
 We have a strong operating history of investing in successful growth initiatives over the past 13 years. We believe that the solution we are able to provide for our customers, as a result of the vertical integration of our company, enhances our brand recognition as a leading producer, results in higher and more efficient utilization of our manufacturing factories and expands our direct‑to‑consumer outreach on the competitive advantages of our wide variety of customizable homes. This operational focus has provided us with sustainable net sales and net income growth over the years. Our growth strategy includes the following key initiatives:
· | Broaden and Deepen Our Retail Presence in Key Geographic Areas. As of December 31, 2018, we distribute our products primarily across 15 states through a combination of 12 company‑owned retail locations and 114 independent retail locations. We believe that a more robust network of company‑owned retail locations will allow us to be more responsive and improve the customer experience at all stages, from manufacturing and design to sales, financing and customer service. We believe our company‑owned stores will, on average, be more productive than our independent retail locations and carry higher gross margins due to our ability to select critical markets and develop highly‑trained sales representatives who possess a deep understanding of our business and customer needs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand Financing Solutions for Our Customers. We recognize that offering financing solutions to our customers is an important component of being a vertically integrated company that provides affordable manufactured housing. Providing financing improves our responsiveness to the needs of prospective purchasers while also providing us with opportunities for loan origination and servicing revenues, which act as additional drivers of net income for us. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we financed approximately 37% and 38% of the homes we sold to consumers, respectively. We intend to expand financing solutions to manufactured housing community‑owner customers, in a manner than includes developing new sites for products in or near urban locations where there is a shortage of sites to place our products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to Focus on Innovation and Customization for Core Customer Groups. Our production strategy is focused on continually developing the resources necessary to efficiently build homes that incorporate unique, varied and innovative customer preferences. We are constantly seeking ways to directly source materials to be used in the manufacturing process, which allows us to ensure we have quality materials that can be customized to meet our customers’ needs. Our principal focus is on designing and building highly functional and durable products that appeal to families of all sizes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Seek Additional Agreements with Owners of Manufactured Home Communities. Community housing developments provide us with large, concentrated sales opportunities. These projects vary in size and density but generally include sales of 30 to 300 homes. We believe there are significant growth opportunities to work with our development partners on such projects and view these opportunities as an important driver for both the sale of more homes and for financing bulk purchases of those homes by community owners. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursue Selective Acquisitions. We seek to grow through selective acquisitions of existing manufactured home retailers in both existing markets and new markets that exhibit strong and reliable long‑term fundamentals. We also regularly evaluate opportunities related to our affordable housing business in our geographic markets. In April 2018, we acquired approximately 420 acres of raw land located near Austin, Texas for $4.2 million. In November 2018, we acquired approximately 69 acres of raw land located near Adkins, Texas for $0.8 million. We are in the process of securing the required approvals to develop 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

manufactured housing communities on the land. We expect to begin development of the communities in the first half of 2019. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop, or to provide financing to third party developers of, additional manufactured housing communities in order to provide locations for manufactured homes for our customers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have experienced substantial year‑over‑year growth in the equity holders’ value of our company, as illustrated from 2009 to 2018 below. We believe our future business growth will be facilitated by the fact that we have already established our company as one of the nation’s leading providers of manufactured homes.
 Equity Holders’ Capital—End of Years 2009 - 2018

 Our Products
 Overview. We are the fourth largest producer of manufactured homes in the United States as ranked by the number of homes manufactured based on information available from the Manufactured Housing Institute and IBTS for the second quarter of 2018. We produce a wide variety of homes that can be used by our customers in a number of ways. We build a variety of sizes and floor plans of residential homes and tiny houses. We work collaboratively with our partners to meet diverse housing needs, such as residences on privately‑owned land and in manufactured home communities, recreational and vacation properties, such as hunting cabins, and accommodations for workforces in oilfields and other industries.
 Manufacturing and Quality Design. We utilize local market research to design homes that meet the specific requirements of our customers and our homes are designed after extensive field research and consumer feedback. We 

 
  10

 
frequently introduce new floor plans, decor, exterior design, features and accessories to appeal to changing consumer trends and we offer an assortment of customizations to match each customer’s individual tastes. Each home typically contains a living room, dining area, kitchen, 1 to 5 bedrooms and 1 to 31/2 bathrooms, and each home can be customized to include certain features including, among others, fireplaces, central air conditioning, overhead heat ducts, stipple‑textured ceilings, decorative wood grain vinyl floors, wood cabinetry and energy conservation elements.
 The manufactured homes we build are constructed in accordance with the construction and safety standards of HUD. Our Texas factories are certified to build homes according to the Texas Industrialized Housing and Buildings law (known as the Texas Modular Code) and our Georgia factory is certified to build homes according to Georgia state construction codes. In addition to traditional manufactured homes, we offer a diverse assortment of tiny houses, which are recreational structures between 320 and 400 square feet in size that are used as temporary dwellings, can be pulled by a pick‑up truck and are generally aesthetically similar to larger homes. Our tiny houses are built in a variety of models and floor plans and typically range from 1 to 3 bedrooms with 1 to 2 bathrooms. Tiny houses do not need to be built to HUD standards.
 Manufacturing Process. Our manufactured homes are entirely constructed and equipped at our three factories. Our homes are constructed using high‑volume production techniques and employ approximately 150 to 275 employees at each facility. Most of our homes are constructed in one or more sections (or floors) on a steel chassis. Each section is assembled in stages beginning with the construction of the chassis, followed by the addition of other constructed and purchased components and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the production process and the benefits of constructing homes in a controlled factory environment enable us to produce homes in less time and at a lower cost per‑square‑foot than traditional home building. The finished home is then transported directly to a customer at a retail sales center, work site or manufactured home community. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold 3,950 and 3,274 home sections, including 245 and 366 tiny houses, respectively.
 Manufacturing Facilities. We currently operate three manufacturing facilities located in Fort Worth, Texas, Commerce, Texas and Eatonton, Georgia, each of which range in size from approximately 97,000 to 388,000 square feet. The production schedules for our manufacturing facilities are based on wholesale orders received from distributors, which fluctuate from week to week. In general, our facilities are structured to operate on one 8‑ to 9‑hour shift per day, five days per week. We currently manufacture a typical home in approximately three to six production days. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we produced, on average, approximately 75 home sections per week, or 62 fully‑completed homes, compared to approximately 70 home sections per week, or 58 fully‑completed homes depending on product mix, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 Raw Materials and Suppliers. The principal materials used in the production of our manufactured homes include wood, wood products, steel, aluminum, gypsum wallboard, windows, doors, fiberglass insulation, carpet, vinyl, fasteners, plumbing materials, appliances and electrical items. We currently buy these materials from various third‑party manufacturers and distributors. We procure multiple sources of supplies for all key materials in order to mitigate any supply chain risk. We intend to continue seeking greater direct sourcing of materials from original manufacturers. This will allow us to save costs, gain greater control over the quality of the materials we use in our products and increase customization to meet our customers’ changing preferences. The inability to obtain any materials used in the production of our homes, whether resulting from material shortages, limitation of supplier facilities or other events affecting production of component parts, may affect our ability to meet or maintain production requirements. We have not previously experienced any material difficulty in obtaining key materials in adequate quantity or quality.
 Warranties. We provide the retail home buyer with a one‑year limited warranty from the date of purchase covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure, plumbing and electrical systems. Our warranty does not extend to installation and setup of the home, which is generally arranged by the retailer. Appliances, carpeting, roofing and similar items are warranted by their original manufacturer for various lengths of time. At this time, we do not provide any warranties with respect to tiny houses.
 Backlog. As of December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of orders of approximately 416 home sections totaling $13.3 million. Our backlog figure is calculated based on purchase orders received from retailers; however, retailers may cancel purchase orders prior to production without penalty. After production of a particular home has commenced, the 

 
  11

 
purchase order becomes non‑cancelable and the retailer is obligated to take delivery of the home. Accordingly, until production of a particular home has commenced, our order backlog should not necessarily be construed as representing firm orders or as net sales until actually earned. Therefore, management does not view backlog as a key performance indicator and this information is primarily tracked by management for internal review purposes.
 Distribution
 As of December 31, 2018, we distribute our manufactured homes primarily across 15 states through a network of 114 independent retail locations, 12 company‑owned retail locations and direct sales to owners of manufactured home communities. As is common in the industry, our independent distributors typically sell manufactured homes produced by other manufacturers in addition to our manufactured homes. Additionally, some independent retailers operate multiple sales outlets. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no independent retailer accounted for 10% or more of our manufacturing sales.
 Below is a list of the states in which we sold most of our manufactured homes and the approximate percentage of those sales to our total product sales:

 | % of 2018 | | % of 2017 | 
 | Total | | Total | 
Location | Net Sales | | Net Sales | 
Texas | 56 | % | 62 | %
Georgia | 13 | % | 8 | %
Louisiana | 11 | % | 4 | %
Oklahoma | 4 | % | 5 | %
Colorado | 2 | % | 8 | %

      In 2018 and 2017, we also sold homes in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia. We continually seek to increase our wholesale shipments by growing sales at our existing independent retailers and by finding new independent retailers to sell our homes. We provide comprehensive sales training to retail sales associates and bring them to our manufacturing facilities for product training and to view new product designs as they are developed. These training seminars facilitate the sale of our homes by increasing the skill and knowledge of the retail sales consultants. Additionally, we display our products at trade shows and support our retailers through the distribution of floor plan literature, brochures, decor selection displays and point of sale promotional material, as well as internet‑based marketing assistance. We believe we have the most comprehensive printed catalog of manufactured housing products in the industry.
 Our independent retailers generally either pay cash to purchase inventory or finance their inventory needs through our consignment arrangements. Certain of our independent retailers finance a portion of their inventory through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third parties. In such cases, we verify the order with the third party, then manufacture the home and ship it to the retailer. Payment is due from the third‑party lender upon shipment of the product to the retailer and, depending on the terms of each arrangement, we may or may not have limited repurchase obligations associated with this inventory. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $2,186,000 and $1,765,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, without reduction for the resale value of the homes.
 Approximately 67% of our 2018 product sales were attributable to our independent retail distributors, 9% to our company‑owned retail locations and 24% to direct sales to owners of manufactured housing communities. Approximately 73% of our 2017 product sales were attributable to our independent retail distributors, 6% to our company‑owned retail locations and 21% directly to owners of manufactured housing communities.

 In addition to our expansive independent retailer channel, we have attractive growth opportunities to expand our company‑owned locations. As of December 31, 2018, we operate 12 company‑owned retail locations. Our company‑owned locations allow us to improve the customer experience through all steps of the buying process, from manufacturing and design to sales, financing and customer service. This also gives us a direct window into consumer preferences and lending opportunities. We believe that our company‑owned stores will, on average, be more productive than our independent retail locations and carry higher gross margins.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our corporate marketing efforts focus on increasing our brand awareness and communicating our commitment to quality along with the many other competitive advantages our company offers. Our marketing strategy is to offer several lines of manufactured homes that appeal to a wide range of home buyers, continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our products. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including digital advertising, email marketing, social media and affiliate marketing, as well as through various strategic partnerships. We maintain our website at www.legacyhousingcorp.com. We intend to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase our spending on sales, marketing and promotion in connection with the continued development of our company‑owned retail locations.
 Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on households with annual incomes of less than $60,000 which includes young families, working class families and persons age 50 and older. We also market to other types of customers, including owners of manufactured home communities, buyers interested in tiny houses, recreational buyers and houses for workforces or man‑camp housing. Additionally, we continue to be well‑positioned to react to any increase in demand for affordable, quickly‑delivered manufactured homes as a result of unforeseen harsh weather conditions and similar events. All of our customers are located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales.

 Three Types of Financing. Offering financing solutions to our dealers and customers generally improves our responsiveness to the needs of prospective purchasers while also providing us with opportunities for loan origination and servicing revenues, which acts as an additional driver of net income for us.
 Floor Plan Financing. We provide floor plan or wholesale financing for most of our independent retailers for products we manufacture and for pre‑owned products. This wholesale financing is a consignment from us to our independent retailers. The retailers pay their own freight and pay us a monthly fee ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% per month of the wholesale invoice amount of the home. They are also obligated to pay $1,000 toward the invoice amount each year after the consignment with the first $1,000 reduction due one year following consignment. During 2018, we collected $98,000 from the independent retailers. Upon sale, the independent retailer is obligated to pay us the invoice amount, less any prepaid reductions, prior to moving the home away from their retail location. If they provide certain documentation to us, we allow them to move the home to their customer’s location and we notify the customer’s lending source to pay us the amount due upon funding of the loan. We have proprietary technology that we install in each consigned home that gives us the ability to determine if any consigned home has been moved from the retail location without permission. The independent dealer is free to terminate the consignment agreement by giving us 90‑days’ advance notice if it is current on all its obligations to us. Our wholesale consignment contracts allow us to defer income recognition until we are paid in full. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded consignment sales  of $50,133,000 and $46,986,000, respectively. Consignment sales are recorded when a house under one of our consignment agreements is sold to the end consumer. 
 Certain of our wholesale factory‑built housing sales to independent retailers are purchased through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution under which we are obligated, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which is typically 24 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of contingent obligations under our repurchase agreements (without reduction for the resale value of the homes) as of December 31, 2018 was $2,186,000. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. We carry no reserve for this contingent liability.
 Consumer Financing. Sales of factory‑built homes are significantly affected by the availability and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory‑built housing industry: (i) chattel or personal property loans, for purchasers of a home without any underlying land involved (generally HUD code homes), (ii) non‑conforming mortgages for purchasers of a home and the land on which the home is placed, and (iii) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Veterans Affairs or GSE loans. At the present time, we currently offer only chattel loans. As our own network of company‑owned retail centers becomes a larger share of our production, we will be able to couple our consumer‑financing solutions with increased levels of anticipated sales from our own centers.
 We provide retail consumer financing to consumers who purchase our full‑size manufactured homes and tiny houses and dealer incentive arrangements to encourage independent retailers to use our financing product. Under these arrangements, once a customer executes a home purchase agreement with Legacy financing, we pay to the retailer 80% of the retailer’s gross margin through these consignment arrangements and we retain 20% of the retail gross margins in the consignment portfolio. We transfer the consigned value of the home to the consignment portfolio as our contribution to the consignment arrangement. The retailer is obligated to remarket any repossessions associated with consignment transactions, and obtain 90% of the outstanding balance on the home at the time of repossession. We charge each dealer in the consignment arrangement fees for servicing the loans and receive a preferred return of 10% to 12% per annum for amounts we invest. Upon payback of our contribution, fees and preferred returns, we split the remaining balance with the independent retailer according to a negotiated formula which is accounted for as the dealer incentive liability. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 2,868 retail consumer loans with an average principal balance of $35,000. Our average 

 
  14

 
remaining term on these loans as of December 31, 2018 was 137 months and the average percentage rate (APR) of interest was 14%. Our average loan‑to‑value (“LTV”) at the time of loan origination, which is based on the gross sales price to the borrower, was 82% for the consumer financing portfolio as of December 31, 2018. We have not financed, and have no current plans to finance, new homes manufactured by our competitors in the ordinary course of our business.
 All loan applications go through an underwriting process conducted at our corporate headquarters to evaluate credit risk that takes into account numerous factors including the down payment, FICO score, monthly income, and total housing payment coverage of the borrower. The interest rates on approved loans are determined by a buyer’s credit score and down payment amount. We use payment history to monitor the credit quality of the consumer loans on an ongoing basis.
 Manufactured Housing Community Financing. We provide financing to owners of manufactured housing communities for our products that they buy in order to rent to their residents. These loans generally have a ten‑year term and bear interest at the prime rate plus 4%, with a floor and a ceiling. Down payments, delivery expenses and installation expenses are negotiated on a case‑by‑case basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans outstanding from manufactured home communities totaled $57,935,000 and $49,500,000, which comprised 346 and 365 loans, respectively. Our average remaining term on these loans as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately seven years.
 We also make loans to community owners for the purpose of acquiring or developing properties and, as part of the arrangement, these community owners contract to buy homes from us. These loans typically range in term from two to five years and carry interest at 8% to 12%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated loans to owners of manufactured home communities for lot development purpose with a total amount outstanding of $1,077,000.
 Competition
 The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels, with competition based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, promotion, merchandising and the terms of retail and wholesale consumer financing. We compete with other producers of manufactured homes and new producers continue to enter the market. We also compete with companies offering for sale homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers and we compete with new and existing site‑built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses and condominiums.
 In addition to our company, there are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the United States, including Clayton Homes, Inc., Cavco Industries, Inc. and Skyline Champion Corporation. Certain of these competitors possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than we do. For the past 15 years, the industry has experienced a trend towards consolidation and, as a result, the bulk of the market share is controlled by a small number of companies. We are the country’s fourth largest producer of manufactured homes. Accordingly, we believe we have a significant opportunity to expand in this industry by effectively growing our market share.
 Among lenders to manufactured home buyers, there are significant competitors including national, regional and local banks, independent finance companies, mortgage brokers and mortgage banks such as 21st Mortgage Corporation, an affiliate of Clayton Homes, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Triad Finance Corporation and CU Factory Built Lending, LP. Certain of these competitors are larger than us and have access to substantially more capital and cost efficiencies.
 Protection of Proprietary Technology
 We rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary information, technology and brands. We protect our proprietary information and technology, in part, by requiring certain of our employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them 

 
  15

 
while employed by us. We also may enter into non‑disclosure and invention assignment agreements with certain of our technical consultants to protect our confidential and proprietary information and technology. We cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants will not be breached, that we will be able to effectively enforce these agreements, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements, or that our trade secrets and other proprietary information and technology will not be disclosed or will otherwise be protected.
 Our intellectual property includes copyrights issued by the U.S. Copyright Office for many of our floor plans. We are not currently aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our intellectual property rights.
 Government Regulation
 General. Our company operates in a regulated industry, and there are many federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations that impact our business. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines, the entry of injunctions or both. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with all applicable laws and enforcement policies.
 Federal Manufactured Homes Regulations. Our manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. Construction of manufactured housing is governed by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, and the regulations issued under such act by HUD. The HUD regulations, known collectively as the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, cover all aspects of manufactured home construction, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. Our Texas manufacturing facilities, and the plans and specifications of the HUD‑compliant homes they produce, have been approved by a HUD‑certified inspection agency. Further, an independent HUD‑certified third‑party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with HUD regulations during construction. Failure to comply with applicable HUD regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities. We believe our manufactured homes are in substantial compliance with all present HUD requirements. Manufactured homes are typically built with wood products that contain formaldehyde resins. HUD regulates the allowable concentrations of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and requires manufacturers to warn purchasers as to formaldehyde‑associated risks. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other governmental agencies have in the past evaluated the effects of formaldehyde. We use materials in our manufactured homes that meet HUD standards for formaldehyde emissions and believe we comply with HUD and other applicable government regulations in this regard.
 Transportation and Zoning Regulations. The transportation of manufactured homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities. Such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements. Our manufactured homes (including our tiny houses) are also subject to local zoning and housing regulations. In certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold, local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately‑owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities. Such ordinances and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect. A number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes. Utility connections are subject to state and local regulations which must be complied with by the retailer or other person installing the home.
 Warranty Regulations. Certain warranties we issue may be subject to the Magnuson‑Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, which regulates the descriptions of warranties on consumer products. For example, warranties that are subject to the act must be included in a single easy‑to‑read document that is generally made available prior to purchase. The act also prohibits certain attempts to disclaim or modify implied warranties and the use of deceptive or misleading terms. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations. A number of states require manufactured home producers to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims.

 Financial Services Regulations. A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated under that act require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit. The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated under that act prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X promulgated under that act require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements. The Federal Trade Commission has adopted or proposed various Trade Regulation Rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers’ claims and defenses. Installment sales contracts, direct loans and mortgage loans eligible for inclusion in a Ginnie Mae program are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the FHA. The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act provides assistance for the housing industry, including manufactured homes, including, among other things, increased loan limits for chattel (home‑only Title I) loans. Recent FHA guidelines provide Ginnie Mae the ability to securitize manufactured home FHA Title I loans to allow lenders to obtain new capital, which can then be used to fund new loans for our customers. The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act established requirements for the licensing and registration of all individuals that are Mortgage Loan Originators (“MLOs”). Traditionally, manufactured housing retailers have assisted home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes, including negotiating rates and the terms for their loans. Under the act, however, these activities are prohibited unless performed by a registered or licensed MLO. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to financing documents. Regulation C of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, among other things, requires certain financial institutions, including non‑depository institutions, to collect, record, report and disclose information about their mortgage lending activity, which is used to identify potential discriminatory lending patterns and enforce anti‑discrimination statutes.
 The Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed into law and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) regulates consumer financial products and services. Certain CFPB mortgage finance rules apply to consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, including real property mortgages and chattel loans secured by manufactured homes. These rules, among other things, define standards for origination of “Qualified Mortgages,” establish specific requirements for lenders to prove borrowers’ ability to repay, outline conditions under which Qualified Mortgages are subject to safe harbor limitations on liability to borrowers and establish interest rates and other cost parameters for determining which Qualified Mortgages fall under safe harbor protection. While many manufactured homes are financed with agency‑conforming mortgages in which the ability to repay is verified, and interest rates and other costs are within the safe harbor limits, a significant amount of loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes, particularly chattel loans and non‑conforming land‑home loans, fall outside such safe harbors. Additionally, the CFPB rules, among other things, amended the Truth‑in‑Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act by expanding the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 (“HOEPA”) and imposing additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain manufactured home loans are now subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed “High Cost Mortgages” and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of manufactured homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered High Cost Mortgages under these rules and while some lenders may offer loans that are deemed High Cost Mortgages, the rate and fee limits may deter some lenders from offering such loans to borrowers or be reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. Additionally, certain CFPB rules apply to appraisals on principal residences securing higher‑priced mortgage loans. Certain loans secured by manufactured homes, primarily chattel loans, could be considered higher‑priced mortgage loans. Among other things, the rules require creditors to provide copies of appraisal reports to borrowers prior to loan closing. Compliance with the regulations may constrain lenders’ ability to profitably price certain loans or may cause lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls and infrastructure and may cause some lenders to curtail underwriting certain loans altogether. Furthermore, some investors may be reluctant to participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure necessary financing. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect our earnings, limit our access to capital and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd‑Frank Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Dodd‑Frank Reform Act revises portions of the Dodd‑Frank Act, reduces the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions, including eliminating provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (“SAFE Act”), and protects consumer access to credit. With the elimination of certain provisions of the SAFE Act, manufactured housing retailers can now assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they may not assist in negotiating the financing terms. This will enable buyers to more easily find access to financing and make the overall home buying experience smoother.
 On January 25, 2018, HUD announced a top‑to‑bottom review of its manufactured housing rules as part of a broader effort to identify regulations that may be ineffective, overly burdensome, or excessively costly given the critical need for affordable housing. If certain changes are made, our company may be able to more effectively serve buyers of affordable homes.
 In 2017, our lead lender required an extensive review of our retail installment contract and associated procedures, which we use as part of our consumer financing solutions strategy. Based on that review, we improved certain elements of the language used in our contracts, and modified certain aspects of our practices. Although we believe there are no material compliance issues with our forms and procedures, we are subject to the federal and other regulations described above.
 Seasonality
 Generally, we experience higher sales volume during the months of March through October. Our sales are generally slower during the winter months, and shipments can be delayed in certain geographic market areas that we serve which experience harsh weather conditions. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 800 employees. Of our employees, approximately 700 individuals are hourly employees and approximately 100 individuals are salaried employees. Our employees are currently not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
