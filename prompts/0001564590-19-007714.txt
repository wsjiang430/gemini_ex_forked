ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 QNB was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on June 4, 1984. QNB is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and conducts its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, QNB Bank (the “Bank”).
 Prior to December 28, 2007, the Bank was a national banking association organized in 1877 as The Quakertown National Bank, was chartered under the National Banking Act and was subject to Federal and state laws applicable to national banks. Effective December 28, 2007, the Bank became a Pennsylvania chartered commercial bank and changed its name to QNB Bank. The Bank, whose principal office is located in Quakertown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, operated eleven full-service community banking offices in Bucks, Montgomery and Lehigh counties in southeastern Pennsylvania as of December 31, 2018.
 The Bank is engaged in the general commercial banking business and provides a full range of banking services to its customers. These banking services consist of, among other things, attracting deposits and using these funds in making commercial loans, residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and purchasing investment securities. These deposits are in the form of time, demand and savings accounts. Time deposits include certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. The Bank’s demand and savings accounts include money market accounts, interest-bearing demand accounts (including a higher yielding checking account), club accounts, traditional statement savings accounts, and a higher yielding online savings account.
 At December 31, 2018, QNB had total assets of $1,175,452,000, total loans of $785,448,000, total deposits of $1,015,598,000 and total shareholders’ equity of $104,348,000. For the year ended December 31, 2018, QNB reported net income of $11,335,000 compared to net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $8,289,000 and December 31, 2016 of $8,924,000.

At February 21, 2019, the Bank had 179 full-time employees and 12 part-time employees. The Bank’s employees have a customer-oriented philosophy emphasizing personal service and flexible solutions which together make achieving our customers’ goals possible. They maintain close contact with both the residents and local business people in the communities in which they serve, responding to changes in market conditions and customer requests in a timely manner.
 Competition and Market Area
 The banking business is highly competitive, and the profitability of QNB depends principally upon the Bank’s ability to compete in its market area. QNB faces intense competition within its market, both in making loans and attracting deposits. Bucks, Lehigh, and Montgomery counties have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large national and regional banks, community banks, savings institutions and credit unions. Some of QNB’s competitors offer products and services that QNB currently does not offer, such as traditional trust services and full-service insurance.
 In addition, as a result of consolidation in the banking industry, some of QNB’s competitors may enjoy advantages such as greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. However, QNB has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing the establishment of long-term relationships and customer loyalty. A strong focus on small-business solutions, providing fast local decision-making on loans, exceptional personal customer service and technology solutions, including internet- and mobile-banking, electronic bill pay and remote deposit capture, also enable QNB to compete successfully.
 Competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and non-bank financial service providers. Factors in successfully competing for deposits include providing excellent customer service, convenient locations and hours of operation, attractive rates, low fees, and alternative delivery systems. One such delivery system is remote deposit capture for those commercial customers that are not conveniently located near one of our branches, or mobile banking for retail customers. Successful loan origination tends to depend not only on interest rate and terms of the loan but also on being responsive and flexible to the customers’ needs. While many competitors within the Bank’s primary market have substantially higher legal lending limits, QNB often has the ability, through loan participations, to meet the larger lending needs of its customers.
 QNB’s success is dependent to a significant degree on economic conditions in southeastern Pennsylvania, especially Bucks, Lehigh and Montgomery counties, which it defines as its primary market. The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions, including the effects of recession, unemployment, declining real estate values, inflation, trends in the national and global economies, and other factors beyond QNB’s control.
 Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions
 The business of financial institutions is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve regulates money, credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits. These policies and regulations significantly affect the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and the interest rates paid on deposits.
 The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to have significant effects in the future. In view of the changing conditions in the economy and the financial markets in addition to the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities, the prediction of future changes in interest rates, credit availability or deposit levels is very challenging.
 Supervision and Regulation
 Banks and bank holding companies operate in a highly-regulated environment and are regularly examined by Federal and state regulatory authorities. Federal statutes that apply to QNB and its subsidiary include the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”), the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), as those statutes have been significantly amended by recent laws such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), and others. In general, these statutes regulate the corporate governance of the Bank and eligible business activities of QNB and impose certain restrictions and limitations on such important matters as mergers and acquisitions, intercompany transactions, loans and dividends, and capital adequacy, among others. Other corporate governance requirements are imposed on QNB by Federal securities and other laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, described later.

The Company is under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission and of state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities. In addition, the Company is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider trading.
 Set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant regulatory concepts and recent laws that affect QNB and the Bank. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by references to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions themselves. Proposals to change banking laws and regulations are frequently introduced in Congress, the state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies. QNB cannot determine the likelihood of passage or timing of any such proposals or legislation or the impact they may have on QNB and its subsidiary. A change in law, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on QNB and its subsidiary.
 Bank Holding Company Regulation
 QNB is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to the regulations of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. In addition, QNB Corp., as a Pennsylvania business corporation, is subject to the provisions of Section 115 of the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965 (the “Banking Code”) and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988 (the “BCL”), as amended.
 Bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with, and are subject to examination by, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s regulations require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Federal Reserve, pursuant to its “source of strength” regulations, may require QNB to commit its resources to provide adequate capital funds to the Bank during periods of financial distress or adversity.
 Federal Reserve approval may be required before QNB may begin to engage in any non-banking activity and before any non-banking business may be acquired by QNB.
 Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends
 Dividend payments made by the Bank to the Company are subject to the Pennsylvania Banking Code, the FDIA, and the regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Under the Banking Code, no dividends may be paid except from “accumulated net earnings” (generally retained earnings). The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings, with some exceptions. Under the FDIA, the Bank is prohibited from paying any dividends, making other distributions or paying any management fees if, after such payment, it would fail to satisfy its minimum capital requirements. See also “Supervision and Regulation – Bank Regulation”.
 In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the banking regulators have the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the Bank if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank.
 Under Pennsylvania law, QNB may not pay a dividend, if, after giving effect thereto, it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business and, after giving effect to the dividend, the total assets of QNB would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if QNB were to be dissolved at the time of distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose rights are superior to those receiving the dividend.
 It is also the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company generally only pay dividends on common stock out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with a bank holding company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios at the 100% level unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. A bank holding company also should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure on the capital of such institution’s subsidiaries, or that may undermine the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength for such subsidiaries.
 In July 2013, the Federal bank regulatory agencies adopted revisions to the agencies’ capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules, which were designed to enhance such requirements and implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly referred to as Basel III. The rules generally implemented higher minimum capital requirements, added a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement, and established criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity Tier 1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital. The current minimum capital requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered “well capitalized”), a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (8.0% to be considered “well capitalized”) and a total capital ratio remains at 8.0% (10.0% to be considered “well capitalized”). In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), as of January 1, 2019, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. 
 - 5 -

Under these policies and subject to the restrictions applicable to the Bank, to remain “well capitalized,” the Bank had approximately $17,365,000 available for payment of dividends to the Company at December 31, 2018.
 Capital Adequacy
 Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital guidelines. The required minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of total capital must be Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists principally of common shareholders’ equity, plus retained earnings, less certain intangible assets. The remainder of total capital may consist of the allowance for loan losses, which is considered Tier 2 capital. At December 31, 2018, QNB’s Tier 1 capital and total capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2 combined) and common equity Tier 1 equity ratios were 12.23% and 13.21%, and 12.23%, respectively.
 Bank and thrift holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, will be permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital; however, trust preferred securities issued by a bank or thrift holding company (other than those with assets of less than $500 million) after May 19, 2010, will no longer count as Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities still will be entitled to be treated as Tier 2 capital.
 In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to maintain a minimum leverage ratio. This requires a minimum level of Tier 1 capital (as determined under the risk-based capital rules) to average total consolidated assets of 4% for those bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. The Federal Reserve expects all other bank holding companies to maintain a ratio of at least 1% to 2% above the stated minimum. At December 31, 2018, QNB’s leverage ratio was 9.40%.
 Pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA, the Federal banking agencies have specified, by regulation, the levels at which an insured institution is considered well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. Under these regulations, an institution is considered well capitalized if it satisfies each of the following requirements:
  
• | Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more.
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more.
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or more.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage ratio of 5% or more, and
--+----------------------------------


• | Not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At December 31, 2018, the Bank qualified as well capitalized under these regulatory standards. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included at Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 
 Bank Regulation
 As a Pennsylvania-chartered insured commercial bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Department”) and by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 The Federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, the reserves required to be kept against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations, and the establishment of branches. The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and not for the purpose of protecting QNB’s shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the Federal and state banking agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department, the FDIC or the United States Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Bank and their operations.
 As a subsidiary bank of a bank holding company, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to QNB, on investments in the stock or other securities of QNB, and on taking such stock or securities as collateral for loans.

FDIC Insurance Assessments
 The Bank’s deposits are insured to the applicable limits as determined by the FDIC, which is currently $250,000 per depositor.
 The FDIC utilizes a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments (billed in arrears) based on an insured institution’s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. Well-capitalized institutions with the CAMELS ratings of 1 or 2 are grouped in Risk Category I.
 Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base that the FDIC uses to calculate assessment premiums is a bank’s average assets minus average tangible equity. The FDIC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to establish assessment rates that will allow the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to achieve a reserve ratio of 1.35% of Insurance Fund insured deposits by September 2020. In addition, the FDIC has established a “designated reserve ratio” of 2.0%, a target ratio that, until it is achieved, will not likely result in the FDIC reducing assessment rates. In attempting to achieve the mandated 1.35% ratio, the FDIC is required to implement assessment formulas that charge banks over $10 billion in consolidated assets (“large institutions”) more than banks below $10 billion (“small institutions”).  
 
The FDIC Reserve Ratio is the total of the DIF divided by the total estimated insured deposits of the industry. The reserve ratio reached 1.15% effective June 30, 2016, which prompted assessment changes.  The assessment changes and corresponding legislative rulings are:
 
 
• | In February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a rule that included the provision that, effective the quarter after the Reserve Ratio reaches 1.15%, the assessment rate schedule for the industry is reduced.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In March 15, 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule in accordance with provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires large institutions to bear the burden of raising the Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Since the Reserve Ratio has reached 1.15%, the FDIC will collect assessment surcharges from large institutions. Once the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, small institutions will receive credits to offset their contribution to raising the Reserve Ratio to 1.35% (see below). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In April 26, 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule amending small institution pricing for deposit insurance which is also effective the quarter after the Reserve Ratio reaches 1.15%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Effective July 1, 2016, changes took place to the pricing system for established (insured 5 or more years) small institutions, that appeared starting with the December 30, 2016 invoice.  The new pricing system results in:
 
 
• | New Assessment Rate Schedule - Effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions were reduced from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points. Total base assessment rates after possible adjustments were reduced from 2.5 to 45 basis points to 1.5 to 40 basis points. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large Institution Surcharges & future Small Institution Credits - Large institution surcharges will be collected for up to eight quarters, therefore, the regular quarterly assessments paid by small banks during that period will also contribute to raising the Reserve Ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC will provide future credit offsets to assessments of small institutions for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the Reserve Ratio growth. Eligible institutions will receive a portion of the aggregate credit amount as determined by the FDIC. The credits will be applied for each quarter the Reserve Ratio is above 1.38% and will not exceed the institution’s quarterly assessment due amount. Institutions will not be allowed to buy or sell credits. Credits will transfer only in a legal merger or consolidation of two insured institutions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small Institution Pricing Changes - The new pricing system uses the Financial Ratios Method to determine assessment rates for all small established institutions. CAMELS composite ratings are used to set minimum and maximum assessment rates for an institution. The new pricing system also revises the Financial Ratios Method so that is it based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years and updates the financial measures used in the Financial Ratios Method so the measures are consistent with the statistical model. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Bank recorded $592,000, $525,000 and $520,000, respectively, in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense.

All insured institutions of the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on Financing Corporation (FICO) bonds. The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. Prior to 1997, only thrift institutions were subject to assessments to raise funds to pay the FICO bonds; however, beginning in 2000, commercial banks and thrifts are subject to the same assessment for FICO bonds. The FDIC has the authority to set the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter. The expense for 2018, 2017 and 2016 recorded by QNB was $32,000, $52,000 and $48,000, respectively. These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature through 2019.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”), which is one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It makes loans to members (i.e. advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $3,865,000 of overnight FHLB advances outstanding.
 The Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB as a condition of membership in an amount equal to 0.10% of its assets. In addition, each member is required to purchase and maintain activity-based stock of 4% of outstanding advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $785,000 in stock of the FHLB.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act, (“CRA”) as amended the FDIC is required to assess all financial institutions that it regulates to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities that they serve. The CRA focuses specifically on low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
 An institution’s record is considered during the evaluation of any application made by such institutions for, among other things:
  
• | Approval of a branch or other deposit facility;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | An office relocation or a merger; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | Any acquisition of bank shares.
--+--------------------------------

 The CRA also requires that the regulatory agency make publicly available the evaluation of the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. This evaluation includes a descriptive rating of either outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance, and a statement describing the basis for the rating. The Bank’s most recent CRA rating was “Satisfactory”.
 USA Patriot Act
 The USA Patriot Act strengthens the anti-money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act. The Act requires financial institutions to establish certain procedures to be able to identify and verify the identity of its customers. Specifically, the Bank must have procedures in place to:

• | Verify the identity of persons applying to open an account;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ensure adequate maintenance of the records used to verify a person’s identity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Determine whether a person is on any U.S. government agency list of known or suspected terrorists or a terrorist organization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to bolster public confidence in the nation’s capital markets by imposing new duties and penalties for non-compliance on public companies and their executives, directors, auditors, attorneys and securities analysts. Some of the more significant aspects of the Act include:
  
• | Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports - requires Chief Executive Officers (“CEOs”) and Chief Financial Officers (“CFOs”) to certify certain matters relating to a company’s financial records and accounting and internal controls.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management Assessment of Internal Controls - requires auditors to certify the company’s underlying controls and processes that are used to compile the filnancial results for companies that are accelerated filers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - 8 -

 
• | Real-time Issuer Disclosures - requires that companies provide real-time disclosures of any events that may affect the company’s stock price or financial performance, generally within a 48-hour period.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Criminal Penalties for Altering Documents - provides severe penalties for “whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates” any record or document with intent to impede an investigation. Penalties include monetary fines and prison time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Act also imposes requirements for corporate governance, auditor independence, accounting standards, audit committee member independence and increased authority, executive compensation, insider loans and whistleblower protection. As a result of the Act, QNB adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to its CEO, CFO and Controller, which meets the requirements of the Act, to supplement its long-standing Code of Ethics, which applies to all directors and employees.
 QNB’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found on the Bank’s website at www.qnbbank.com.
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”)
 The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010. This law made significant changes to the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
 The Dodd-Frank Act required various Federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations and to prepare various studies and reports for Congress. The Federal agencies were given significant discretion in drafting such rules and regulations and are still modifying many of the provisions. Consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
 The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets such as the Bank will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakened the Federal preemption rules that had been applicable for national banks and Federal savings associations and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce Federal consumer protection laws.
 Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act do not apply to the Bank, as it does not engage in many of the specific activities sought to be regulated by the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of the provisions, however, such as the increased capital requirements that began in 2015 and the changes to FDIC insurance premiums already implemented, affected all banking entities. In addition, the financial crisis of 2008 and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in response to that crisis has resulted in an era of increased regulatory oversight over all financial entities. The ultimate changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), which was designed to ease certain restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted into law.  Most of the changes made by the new Act can be grouped into five general areas:  mortgage lending; certain regulatory relief for “community” banks; enhanced consumer protections in specific areas, including subjecting credit reporting agencies to additional requirements; certain regulatory relief for large financial institutions, including increasing the threshold at which institutions are classified a systemically important financial institutions (from $50 billion to $250 billion) and therefore subject to stricter oversight, and revising the rules for larger institution stress testing; and certain changes to Federal securities regulations designed to promote capital formation.  Some of the key provisions of the Act as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as “qualified mortgages” for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring Federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to high volatility commercial real estate loans (HVCRE), which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; and (vii) changing the eligibility for use of the small bank holding company policy statement from institutions with under $1 billion in assets to institutions with under $3 billion in assets.  QNB continues to analyze the changes implemented by the Act; but, does not believe that such changes will materially impact QNB’s business, operations, or financial results.

Section 201 of the Act directed the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) of not less than 8% and not more than 10% for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.  Qualifying community banking organizations that exceed the CBLR level established by the agencies, and that elect to be covered by the CBLR framework, will be considered to have met:  (i) the generally applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements under the banking agencies’ capital rules; (ii) the capital ratio requirements necessary to be considered “well capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework in the case of insured depository institutions; and (iii) any other applicable capital or leverage requirements.  
 On February 8, 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC published for comment a proposed rule to implement the provisions of Section 201 of the Act.  Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be defined as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with less than $10 billion in assets and specified limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and certain temporary difference deferred tax assets.  A qualifying community banking organization would be permitted to elect the CBLR framework if its CBLR is greater than 9%.  The proposed rulemaking also addresses opting in and opting out of the CBLR framework by a community banking organization, the treatment of a community banking organization that falls below CBLR requirements, and the effect of various CBLR levels for purposes of the prompt corrective action categories applicable to insured depository institutions.  Advanced approaches banking organizations (generally, institutions with $250 billion or more in consolidated assets) are not eligible to use the CBLR framework.
 QNB continues to analyze the changes implemented by the Act, including the CBLR framework included in the recently proposed rulemaking.  QNB has not determined at this time whether or not it would qualify for the CBLR framework or, if so, whether it would elect to utilize the CBLR framework when final rules are adopted.  QNB does not believe, however, that the changes resulting from the Act will materially impact QNB’s business, operations, or financial results.
 Possible Future Legislation
 Congress is often considering some financial industry legislation, and the Federal banking agencies routinely propose new regulations. The Company cannot predict the future effect any new legislation, or new rules adopted by Federal or state banking agencies, will have on the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Given that the financial industry remains under scrutiny, the Company expects that there will be legislative and regulatory actions that may materially affect the banking industry in the foreseeable future.
