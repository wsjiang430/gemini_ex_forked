Item 1.    Business.
General
Harsco Corporation (the "Company") is a diversified, multinational provider of industrial environmental services and engineered products serving global industries that are fundamental to worldwide economic growth and infrastructure development. The Company's operations consist of three reportable segments: Harsco Metals & Minerals, Harsco Industrial and Harsco Rail. The Company has locations in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. The Company was incorporated in 1956. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 9,900 employees.
The Company's executive offices are located at 350 Poplar Church Road, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011 and the Company's main telephone number is (717) 763-7064. The Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to such reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available on the Company's website at www.harsco.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the SEC. The information posted on the Company's website is not incorporated into the Company's SEC filings. Additionally, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and other information regarding issuers that electronically file with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
The Company believes each of its segments are among the global market leaders in their respective sectors. However, the Company competes with a range of global, regional and local businesses of varying size and scope, and its competitive environment is complex given the diversity of services and products provided and the global breadth of markets served.
The Company's Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment provides services which are usually subject to volume changes at certain points of the year and the Company furnishes products within the Harsco Industrial Segment that are seasonal in nature. As a result, the Company's revenues and results of operations for the first quarter ending March 31 and the fourth quarter ending December 31 may be lower than the second quarter ending June 30 and the third quarter ending September 30. Additionally, the majority of the Company's cash flows provided by operations has historically been generated in the second half of the year. This is a result of normally higher income and working capital management during the second half of the year.
The raw materials used by the Company for its product manufacturing principally include steel and, to a lesser extent, aluminum, which are readily available the majority of the time. The profitability of the Company's manufactured products may be affected by changing purchase prices of steel, other materials and commodities; as well as electronics and components.
The practices of the Company relating to working capital are similar to those of other industrial service providers or manufacturers servicing both domestic and international industrial customers and commercial markets. These practices include the following:

• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 to 60 days, with progress or advance payments required for certain long-lead-time or large orders. Payment terms are slightly longer in certain international markets. 


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 to 90 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand. Due to the time required to manufacture certain railway track maintenance equipment to customer specifications, inventory levels of this business tend to increase for an extended period of time during the production phase and decline when the equipment is delivered. 

The Company has become subject to, as have others, stringent air and water quality control legislation. In general, the Company has not experienced substantial difficulty complying with these environmental regulations and does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. While the Company expects that environmental regulations may expand, and that expenditures for air and water quality control will continue, the Company cannot predict the effect on its business of such expanded regulations. For additional information regarding environmental matters see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Segment Information
The Company reports segment information using the "management approach," based on the way management organizes and reports the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company's reportable segments are identified based upon differences in products, services and markets served. These segments and the types of products and services offered are more fully described below. Financial information concerning segments and international and domestic operations is included in Note 16, Information by Segment and Geographic Area, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment-62%, 63% and 67% of consolidated revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively 
The Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment is one of the world's largest providers of on-site services for product quality improvement; resource recovery from steel and metals manufacturing; and material logistics in approximately 30 countries, with the largest operations focused in the U.S., France, the U.K, Brazil and China. The majority of operating costs are denominated in local currencies, therefore providing a natural hedge against revenues generated in non-U.S. dollar markets. This Segment's operations are linked to customer operations and the performance of services enables the customer to focus on their core business.
This Segment also provides value added environmental solutions for industrial byproducts. For example, this Segment also produces industrial abrasives and roofing granules from power-plant utility coal slag at several locations throughout the U.S. The Company's BLACK BEAUTY® abrasives are used for industrial surface preparation, such as rust removal and cleaning of bridges, ship hulls and various structures. Roofing granules are sold to residential roofing shingle manufacturers in the U.S., primarily for the replacement roofing market. This business is one of the largest U.S. producers of slag abrasives, residential roofing granules. Additionally, this Segment extracts high-value metallic content from stainless steel by-products and specializes in the development of minerals technologies for commercial applications, including agriculture fertilizers. The Segment also sells road base materials and manufactures high performance asphalt products, brander under SteelPhalt, for the UK road-making market. 
In May 2018, the Company acquired Altek Europe Holdings Limited and its affiliated entities, a U.K.-based manufacturer of market leading products that enable aluminum producers and recyclers to manage and efficiently extract value from critical byproduct streams, reduce byproduct generation and improve operating productivity.
As part of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's initiatives to develop new products and services, in particular environmental solutions for industrial co-products and byproduct streams, the Segment is involved with several initiatives focused on developing greater environmental sustainability through the recovery of resources from byproducts and related streams. The principal business drivers of this Segment are global metals production and capacity utilization; outsourcing of services by metals producers; demand for high-value specialty steel and ferro alloys; demand for environmental solutions for metals and minerals byproduct streams; demand for industrial and infrastructure surface preparation and restoration; demand for residential roofing shingles; and demand for road making materials. 
This Segment's key competitive factors are innovative resource recovery solutions, significant industry experience, technology, safety performance, and service quality. This Segment competes principally with a number of privately-held businesses for services outsourced by customers. Additionally, due to the nature of this Segment's services, it encounters a certain degree of competition from customers' desire to perform similar services themselves instead of using an external solution.
The Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment risk exposures are diverse and may vary across locations, customers and underlying end-markets. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment had one customer that provided in excess of 10% of this Segment's revenues under multiple long-term contracts at several mill sites. The loss of any one of the contracts would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position or cash flows; however, it could have a significant effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. Additionally, a decline in economic conditions may impact the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis and could result in bankruptcy or receivership filings by any of such customers. If customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, or if the Company is unable to collect amounts due from customers for any reason, it could adversely impact the realizability of receivables and inventories, and the recoverability of long-lived assets across the Company's businesses. As part of its credit risk management practices, the Company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable positions of its customer base.
The Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment operates generally under long-term contracts with high renewal rates, and in many cases the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment has operated at a customer location for several decades. At December 31, 2018, the Company's metals services contracts had estimated future revenues of $3.1 billion at current production levels, compared with $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017. This provides the Company with a substantial base of anticipated long-term revenues. The increase is primarily due to new and renewed contracts and the timing of contract expirations, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation. Approximately 23% of these revenues are expected to be recognized by December 31, 2019; approximately 42% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022; approximately 15% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2025; and the remaining revenues are expected to be recognized thereafter. There are no significant metals services contracts included in the estimated future revenues for which the estimated costs to complete the contract currently exceed the estimated revenue to be realized. The estimated future revenues are exclusive of anticipated contract renewals, projected volume increases and ad-hoc services. The estimated future revenues are also exclusive of aluminum dross and scrap processing systems; roofing granules; industrial abrasives products; and minerals and metal recovery technologies services.
Harsco Industrial Segment-22%, 19% and 17% of consolidated revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively 
The Harsco Industrial Segment includes the Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers, Harsco Industrial IKG and Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley businesses which are manufacturing businesses located principally in the U.S. Primary competitors are U.S.-based manufacturers of similar products and key competitive factors include product quality and durability, technology and energy-efficiency.
Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers is a leading supplier of custom-engineered and manufactured air-cooled heat exchangers for the natural gas compression and processing industry as well as the refining and petrochemical industry in the U.S. Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers' heat exchangers are the primary apparatus used to condition natural gas during recovery, compression and transportation from underground reserves through major pipeline distribution channels. Principal business drivers include investment in natural gas production capabilities and distribution, and demand for natural gas and downstream refined and derivative products. This business contributed 12%, 9% and 6% of the Company's consolidated revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Harsco Industrial IKG manufactures a varied line of industrial grating and fencing products at several plants in the U.S. and an international plant located in Mexico.  These products include a full range of metal bar grating configurations, which are used mainly in industrial flooring, as well as safety and security applications in various industries. Principal business drivers include industrial plant and warehouse construction and expansions; off-shore drilling and new rig construction, and security fencing requirements to protect facilities and infrastructure.
Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley is a leading manufacturer of energy-efficient heat transfer products such as boilers and water heaters for commercial and institutional applications. The principal business driver is demand for commercial and institutional boilers and water heaters.
The Harsco Industrial Segment had no customers in 2018, one customer in 2017 and no customers in 2016 that provided in excess of 10% of the Segment's revenues. The loss of any individual customer would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial positions or cash flows; however, it could have a material effect on quarterly or annual results of operations.
At December 31, 2018, the Harsco Industrial Segment had an estimated order backlog of $209.1 million compared with $85.3 million at December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily due to fundamental market improvements for the Segment's air-cooled heat exchangers businesses for customers primarily in the natural gas compression, processing and distribution markets as well as downstream markets, ultimately driving higher capital spending. There was also moderate growth in the Segment's industrial and commercial boilers and hot water heater group. At December 31, 2018, all of the Harsco Industrial Segment's backlog is expected to be filled in 2019.
Harsco Rail Segment-16%, 18% and 16% of consolidated revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively
The Harsco Rail Segment is a global provider of equipment, after-market parts and services for the maintenance, repair and construction of railway track. This Segment manufactures and sells highly-engineered railway track maintenance equipment, collision avoidance and warning systems to support passenger, rail worker and pedestrian safety, and measurement and diagnostic technologies that support railway maintenance programs. These products are produced primarily in the U.S. for customers throughout the world. Additionally, this Segment provides railway track maintenance services principally in the U.S. and the U.K. The principal business drivers of this business are global railway track maintenance-of-way capital spending; outsourcing of track maintenance and new track construction by railroads; increased market attention on safety, including collision avoidance and warning systems; and measurement and inspection technologies to monitor track conditions and plan maintenance practices. This Segment's key competitive factors are product quality, technology and customer service. Primary competitors for both products and services are privately-held global businesses as well as certain regional competitors.
The Harsco Rail Segment had one customer in 2018, 2017 and 2016 that provided in excess of 10% of the Segment's revenues. The loss of any individual customer would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial positions or cash flows; however, it could have a material effect on quarterly or annual results of operations.
At December 31, 2018, the Harsco Rail Segment had an estimated order backlog of $297.2 million compared with $260.5 million at December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to higher bookings of equipment and aftermarket parts projects. At December 31, 2018, $144.3 million or 49% of the Harsco Rail Segment's manufactured products order backlog is not expected to be filled in 2019. The remainder of this backlog is expected to be filled through 2021.
