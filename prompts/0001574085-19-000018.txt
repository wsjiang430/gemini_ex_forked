Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are an externally-advised Maryland corporation that was formed in April 2013 as Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. and changed our name to Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. in April 2018. We became a public company on November 19, 2013 when Ashford Trust, a NYSE-listed REIT, completed the spin-off of our company through the distribution of our outstanding common stock to the Ashford Trust stockholders. We invest primarily in high revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) luxury hotels and resorts. High RevPAR, for purposes of our investment strategy, means RevPAR of at least twice the then-current U.S. national average RevPAR for all hotels as determined by Smith Travel Research. Two times the U.S. national average RevPAR was $172 for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code beginning in the year ended December 31, 2013. We conduct our business and own substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership, Braemar OP.
We operate in the direct hotel investment segment of the hotel lodging industry. As of March 6, 2019, we owned interests in thirteen hotel properties in six states, the District of Columbia and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands with 3,719 total rooms, or 3,484 net rooms, excluding those attributable to our joint venture partner. The hotel properties in our current portfolio are predominantly located in U.S. urban and resort locations with favorable growth characteristics resulting from multiple demand generators. We own eleven of our hotel properties directly, and the remaining two hotel properties through an investment in a majority-owned consolidated joint venture entity.
We are advised by Ashford LLC, a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., through an advisory agreement. All of the hotel properties in our portfolio are currently asset-managed by Ashford LLC. Asset management functions include acquisition, renovation, financing and disposition of assets, operational accountability of managers, budget review, capital expenditures and property-level strategies as compared to the day-to-day management of our hotel properties, which is performed by our property managers. We do not have any employees. All of the services that might be provided by employees are provided to us by Ashford LLC.
We do not operate any of our hotel properties directly; instead we employ hotel management companies to operate them for us under management contracts. As of March 6, 2019, Remington Lodging, which is beneficially wholly-owned by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, Chairman of our board of directors, and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust, managed three of our thirteen hotel properties. Third-party management companies managed the remaining hotel properties.
Ashford Inc. also provides other products and services to us or our hotel properties through certain entities in which Ashford Inc. has an ownership interest. These products and services include project management services, mortgage placement services, real estate advisory services, watersports activities, travel/transportation services and mobile key technology. See note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.
On January 15, 2019, in conjunction with our acquisition of the Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe, we entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement (the “ERFP Agreement”) with Ashford Inc. and Ashford LLC. Per the Agreement, Ashford LLC will provide funding to facilitate the acquisition of properties by Braemar OP that are recommended by Ashford LLC, in an aggregate amount of up to $50 million (subject to increase to up to $100 million by mutual agreement). Each funding will equal 10% of the property acquisition price and will be made either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within the two-year period following the date of such acquisition, in exchange for furniture, fixtures & equipment (“FF&E”) for use at the acquired property or any other property owned by Braemar OP. See “Certain Agreements—ERFP Agreement.”
Our Investment and Growth Strategies
Our principal business objectives are to generate attractive returns on our invested capital and long-term growth in cash flow to maximize total returns to our stockholders. To achieve our objectives, we pursue the following strategies:
Focused Investment Strategy. Our strategy is to invest in premium branded and high quality independent luxury hotels and resorts that are anticipated to generate RevPAR at least twice the average RevPAR for the U.S. lodging industry, as determined by Smith Travel Research and are located predominantly in North America.
We intend to concentrate our investments in markets where we believe there are significant growth opportunities, taking into consideration the risk of additional supply. In determining anticipated RevPAR for a particular asset, we may take into account forecasts and other considerations, including without limitation, conversions or repositioning of assets, capital plans, brand changes and other factors which may reasonably be forecasted to raise RevPAR after stabilization. Stabilization with respect to a hotel, after the completion of an initiative such as a capital plan, conversion or change of brand name or change of the business mix or 
4

other operating characteristics, is generally expected to occur within 12 to 24 months after the completion of the related renovation, repositioning or brand change.
In connection with this investment strategy, we frequently evaluate opportunities to acquire additional hotel properties, either through direct ownership, joint ventures, partnership participations or similar arrangements. We may use cash or issue common units in Braemar OP as currency for a transaction. Some or all of these acquisitions, if completed, may be material to our company, individually or in the aggregate. We may, from time to time, be party to letters of intent, term sheets and other non-binding agreements relating to potential acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will enter into definitive acquisition agreements with respect to any potential acquisitions.
Active Asset Management Strategy. We rely on Ashford LLC to asset-manage the hotel properties in our portfolio, and will rely on Ashford LLC to asset manage any hotel properties we may acquire in the future, to help maximize the operating performance, cash flow and value of each hotel. Asset management is intended to include actively “managing” the third-party property managers and holding them accountable to drive top line and bottom line operating performance. Ashford LLC aims to achieve this goal by benchmarking each asset’s performance compared to similar hotel properties within our portfolio. Ashford LLC also closely monitors all hotel operating expenses, as well as third-party vendor and service contracts. If expense levels are not commensurate with the property revenues, Ashford LLC works with the property manager to implement cost cutting initiatives. Ashford LLC is also very active in evaluating and proposing improved strategies for the sales, marketing and revenue management initiatives of the property manager as well as its ability to drive ancillary hotel revenues (for example, spa, food and beverage, parking, and Internet). In addition to supervising and directing the property manager, Ashford LLC works with the brands and management companies to negotiate favorable franchise agreement and property management agreement terms. Ashford LLC also actively participates in brand advisory committee meetings to provide feedback and input on new hotel brand initiatives.
Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy. We intend to pursue a disciplined capital allocation strategy as it relates to the acquisition, operation, disposition and financing of assets in our portfolio and those that we may acquire in the future. Ashford LLC utilizes its extensive industry experience and capital markets expertise to influence the timing of capital deployment and recycling, and we may selectively sell hotel properties that are no longer consistent with our investment strategy or as to which returns appear to have been maximized. To the extent we sell hotel properties, we generally intend to redeploy the capital into investment opportunities that we believe will achieve higher returns or buy back our common stock or other securities.
Our Hotels
As of March 6, 2019, we own interests in a high-quality, geographically diverse portfolio of thirteen hotel properties located in six states, the District of Columbia and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands including The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe, which we acquired in January 2019. Our properties have 3,719 total rooms, or 3,484 net rooms, excluding those attributable to our joint venture partner. All of the hotel properties in our portfolio are generally located in markets that exhibit strong growth characteristics resulting from multiple demand generators. Eight of the thirteen hotel properties in our portfolio operate under premium brands affiliated with Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) and Hilton Worldwide, Inc. (“Hilton”). One hotel property is managed by Accor Business and Leisure Management, LLC (“Accor”), one is managed by Hyatt Hotels Corporation (“Hyatt”) and three hotel properties are managed by Remington Lodging. The material terms of these property management agreements are described below in “Certain Agreements—Hotel Management Agreements.” Each of our hotel properties is encumbered by loans as described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Indebtedness.” For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 75% of the rooms revenue was generated by transient business; approximately 24% was generated by group sales and 1% was generated by contract sales.

Asset Management
The senior management team, provided to us by Ashford LLC, facilitated all asset management services for our hotel properties prior to our spin-off from Ashford Trust and continues to do so, including for the properties we acquired after the spin-off. The team of professionals provided by Ashford LLC proactively works with our third-party hotel management companies to maximize profitability at each of our hotel properties. The asset management team monitors the performance of our hotel properties on a daily basis and holds frequent ownership meetings with personnel at the hotel properties and key executives with the brands and management companies. The asset management team works closely with our third-party hotel management companies on key aspects of each hotel’s operation, including, among others, revenue management, market positioning, cost structure, capital and operational budgeting as well as the identification of return on investment initiatives and overall business strategy. In addition, we retain approval rights on key staffing positions at many of our hotel properties, such as the hotel’s general manager and director of sales. We believe that our strong asset management process helps to ensure that each hotel is being operated to our and our franchisors’ standards, that our hotel properties are being adequately maintained in order to preserve the value of the asset and the safety of the hotel to customers, and that our hotel management companies are maximizing revenue and enhancing operating margins. See “Certain Agreements—The Advisory Agreement.”
Project Management
As a result of Ashford Inc.’s August 2018 acquisition of Premier from affiliates of Remington Lodging, Ashford Inc. (through Premier) also provides us with project management services, including construction management, interior design, architectural oversight, and the purchasing, expediting, warehousing coordination, freight management and supervision of installation of FF&E, and related services. See “Certain Agreements—Premier Master Project Management Agreement.” 
Third-Party Agreements
Hotel Management Agreements. Ten of our hotel properties are operated pursuant to a hotel management agreement with one of four brand hotel management companies and three of our hotel properties are operated pursuant to a hotel management 
19

agreement with Remington Lodging, a property management company owned by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, chairman of our board of directors, and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., chairman emeritus of Ashford Trust. Each hotel management company receives a base management fee and is also eligible to receive an incentive management fee if hotel operating income, as defined in the respective management agreement, exceeds certain thresholds. The incentive management fee is generally calculated as a percentage of hotel operating income after we have received a priority return on our investment in the hotel. See “Certain Agreements—Hotel Management Agreements.”
Franchise Agreements. None of our hotel properties operate under franchise agreements. The hotel management agreements with Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt or Accor allow ten of our hotel properties to operate under the Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt or Sofitel brand names, as applicable, and provide benefits typically associated with franchise agreements and licenses, including, among others, the use of the Courtyard, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Hilton, Hyatt or Sofitel, as applicable, reservation system and guest loyalty and reward program. Any intellectual property and trademarks of Marriott, Hilton Hyatt or Accor, as applicable, are exclusively owned and controlled by the applicable manager or an affiliate of such manager which grants the manager rights to use such intellectual property or trademarks with respect to the applicable hotel.
Licensing Agreement. The Ritz-Carlton, St. Thomas is subject to a License and Royalty Agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”) which allows us to use the Ritz-Carlton brand for fifty years with Marriott having two ten-year extension options. The Royalty Agreement is coterminous with the management agreement. In connection with our ability to use the Ritz-Carlton brand, we are obligated to pay a royalty fee of 2.6% of gross revenues and an incentive royalty of 20% of operating profit in excess of owner’s priority.
Our Financing Strategy
As of December 31, 2018, our property-level indebtedness was approximately $992.6 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.01% per annum. As of December 31, 2018, 100.0% of our mortgage debt is variable rate debt and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%. We intend to continue to use variable-rate debt or a mix of fixed and variable-rate debt as we see fit, and we may, if appropriate, enter into interest rate hedges.
We intend to finance our long-term growth and liquidity needs with operating cash flow, equity issuances of both common and preferred stock, joint ventures, a revolving line of credit and secured and unsecured debt financings having staggered maturities. We target leverage of 45% net debt to gross assets. We may also issue common units in our operating partnership to acquire properties from sellers who seek a tax-deferred transaction. We may also from time to time receive additional capital from our advisor pursuant to the ERFP Agreement.
We may utilize Lismore Capital LLC (“Lismore”), a subsidiary of Ashford Inc., to provide debt placement services, which otherwise would be provided by third parties, for property-level debt financings. The services provided by Lismore include access to Lismore’s deep industry contacts to achieve competitive terms in the market, due diligence support and assistance in completing the financing transaction.
We may use the proceeds from any borrowings for working capital, consistent with industry practice, to:

• | purchase interests in partnerships or joint ventures;


• | finance the origination or purchase of debt investments; or


• | finance acquisitions, expand, redevelop or improve existing properties, or develop new properties or other uses.

Additionally, Ashford LLC must refrain from taking any action that would (a) adversely affect our status as a REIT, (b) subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (c) knowingly and intentionally violate any law, rule or regulation of any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction over us, (d) violate any of the rules or regulations of any exchange on which our securities are listed or (e) violate our charter, bylaws or resolutions of our board of directors, all as in effect from time to time.

Ashford LLC also acknowledges receipt of our code of business conduct and ethics, code of conduct for the chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer and policy on insider trading and agrees to require its employees who provide services to us to comply with the codes and the policy.
Limitations on Liability and Indemnification. The advisory agreement provides that Ashford LLC has no responsibility other than to render the services and take the actions described in the advisory agreement in good faith and with the exercise of due care and will not be responsible for any action our board of directors takes in following or declining to follow any of Ashford LLC’s advice or recommendations. The advisory agreement provides that Ashford LLC (including its officers, directors, managers, employees and members) will not be liable for any act or omission by it (or them) performed in accordance with and pursuant to the advisory agreement, except by reason of acts constituting gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of duties under the advisory agreement.
We have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Ashford LLC (including its partners, directors, officers, stockholders, managers, members, agents, employees and each other person or entity, if any, controlling Ashford LLC) to the full extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities of any nature whatsoever with respect to or arising from Ashford LLC’s acts or omission (including ordinary negligence) in its capacity as such, except with respect to losses, claims, damages or liabilities with respect to or arising out of Ashford LLC’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, or reckless disregard of its duties under the advisory agreement (for which Ashford LLC will indemnify us).
Term and Termination. The initial term of our advisory agreement shall expire on January 24, 2027, with up to seven successive additional ten-year terms upon Ashford LLC’s written notice to us not less than 210 days prior to the expiration of the then current term of Ashford LLC’s election to extend the term of our advisory agreement.
We may terminate the advisory agreement at any time, including during the 10-year initial term, without the payment of a termination fee under the following circumstances:

• | immediately upon providing written notice to Ashford LLC, following its conviction (including a plea or nolo contendere) of a felony;

21


• | immediately upon providing written notice to Ashford LLC, if it commits an act of fraud against us, misappropriates our funds or acts in a manner constituting willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of its material duties under the advisory agreement (including a failure to act); provided, however, that if any such actions or omissions are caused by an employee and/or an officer of Ashford LLC (or an affiliate of Ashford LLC) and Ashford LLC takes all reasonable necessary and appropriate action against such person and cures the damage caused by such actions or omissions within 45 days of Ashford LLC’s actual knowledge of its commission or omission, we will not have the right to terminate the advisory agreement;


• | immediately, upon the commencement of an action for dissolution of our advisor; or


• | (i) upon the entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of a final non-appealable order awarding monetary damages to us based on a finding that our advisor committed a material breach or default of a material term, condition, obligation or covenant of the advisory agreement, which breach or default had a material adverse effect on us, but only where our advisor fails to pay the monetary damages in full within 60 days of the date when the monetary judgment becomes final and non-appealable; provided, however, that if our advisor notified us that our advisor is unable to pay any judgment for monetary damages in full within 60 days of when the judgment becomes final and non-appealable, we may not terminate the advisory agreement if, within the 60-day period, our advisor delivers a promissory note to us having a principal amount equal to the unpaid balance of the judgment and bearing interest at 8.00% per annum, which note shall mature on the 12 month anniversary of the date that the judgment becomes final and non-appealable; and (ii) upon no less than 60 days’ written notice to our advisor, prior to initiating any proceeding claiming a material breach or default by our advisor, of the nature of the default or breach and providing our advisor with an opportunity to cure the default or breach, or if the default or breach is not reasonably susceptible to cure within 60 days, an additional cure period as is reasonably necessary to cure the default or breach so long as our advisor is diligently and in good faith pursuing the cure.

Either party may also terminate the advisory agreement, with the payment of a termination fee, upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company, provided that the party desiring to terminate the advisory agreement shall give written notice to the other party on a date (i) no earlier than the date on which: (1) we enter into a change of control agreement; (2) our board of directors recommends that our stockholders accept the offer made in a change of control tender; or (3) a voting control event occurs; and (ii) no later than two days after the closing of a transaction contemplated by a change of control agreement, completion of a change of control tender, or occurrence of a voting control event.
In connection with a termination due to a Company change of control event, our advisor may agree, in its sole discretion, to provide transition services agreed to by the parties for a period of up to 30 days.
Immediately upon the termination of our advisory agreement, our advisor has the right to repurchase any outstanding shares of our advisor’s common stock and any units of our advisor’s operating company held by us at a price equal to the average of the VWAP of our advisor’s common stock for the 10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date the repurchase option is exercised.
Fees and Expenses.

• | Base Fee. The total monthly base fee is in an amount equal to 1/12th of the sum of (i) 0.70% of the total market capitalization of our company for the prior month, plus (ii) the Net Asset Fee Adjustment (as defined below), if any, on the last day of the prior month during which our advisory agreement was in effect; provided, however in no event shall the base fee for any month be less than the minimum base fee as provided by our advisory agreement. The base fee is payable on the 5th business day of each month.

“Net Asset Fee Adjustment” shall be equal to (i) the product of the Sold Non-ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of real property (other than any Enhanced Return Hotel Assets (as defined in the ERFP Agreement)) sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 0.70% plus (ii) the product of the Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of Enhanced Return Hotel Assets sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with an including the first such sale) and 1.07%.
The minimum base fee for Braemar for each month will be equal to the greater of:

(i) | 90% of the base fee paid for the same month in the prior year; and


(ii) | 1/12th of the “G&A Ratio” multiplied by the total market capitalization of Braemar.

The “G&A Ratio” is calculated as the simple average of the ratios of total general and administrative expenses, including any dead deal costs, less any non-cash expenses, paid in the applicable month by each member of a select peer group, divided by the total market capitalization of such peer group member. The peer group for each company may be adjusted from time-to-time by mutual agreement between Ashford LLC and a majority of our independent directors. Each 
22

month’s base fee is determined based on prior month results and is payable in cash on the fifth business day of the month for which the fee is applied.

• | Incentive Fee. In each year that (i) our common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange for each day of the applicable year; and (ii) our total stockholder return (“TSR”) exceeds the “average TSR of our peer group” we have agreed to pay an incentive fee.

For purposes of this calculation, our TSR means the sum, expressed as a percentage, of (i) the change in our common stock price during the applicable period, plus (ii) the dividend yield paid during the applicable period (determined by dividing dividends paid during the applicable period by our common stock price at the beginning of the applicable period and including the value of any dividends or distributions with respect to common stock not paid in cash valued in the reasonable discretion of our advisor.)
The annual incentive fee is calculated as (i) 5% of the amount (expressed as a percentage but in no event greater than 25%) by which our annual TSR exceeds the average TSR for our peer group, multiplied by (ii) the fully diluted equity value of our company at December 31 of the applicable year. To determine the fully diluted equity value, we will assume that all units in our operating partnership, including long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) units that have achieved economic parity with the common units, if any, have been converted into shares of common stock and that the per share value of each share of our common stock is equal to the closing price of our stock on the last trading day of the year.
The incentive fee, if any, subject to the FCCR Condition (defined below), is payable in arrears in three equal annual installments with the first installment payable on January 15 following the applicable year for which the incentive fee relates and on January 15 of the next two successive years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any termination of the advisory agreement for any reason, any unpaid incentive fee (including any incentive fee installment for the stub period ending on the termination date) will become fully earned and immediately due and payable without regard to the FCCR Condition defined below. Except in the case when the incentive fee is payable on the date of termination of the advisory agreement, up to 50% of the incentive fee may be paid in our common stock or in common units of our operating partnership, at our discretion, with the balance payable in cash unless at the time for payment of the incentive fee, Ashford LLC owns common stock or common units in an amount greater than or equal to three times the base fee for the preceding four quarters or payment in such securities would cause the advisor to be subject to the provision of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or payment in such securities would not be legally permissible for any reason, in which case the entire incentive fee will be payable in cash.
Upon the determination of the incentive fee, except in the case of any termination of the advisory agreement in which case the incentive fee for the stub period and all unpaid installments of an incentive fee shall be deemed earned and fully due and payable, each one-third installment of the incentive fee shall not be deemed earned by the advisor or otherwise payable by us unless we, as of the December 31 immediately preceding the due date for the payment of the incentive fee installment, have a FCCR of 0.20x or greater (the “FCCR Condition”). For purposes of this calculation, “FCCR” means our fixed charge coverage ratio, which is the ratio of adjusted EBITDA for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters to fixed charges, which includes all (i) our and our subsidiaries’ interest expense, (ii) our and our subsidiaries’ regularly scheduled principal payments, other than balloon or similar principal payments which repay indebtedness in full and payments under cash flow mortgages applied to principal, and (iii) preferred dividends paid by us.

• | Equity Compensation. To incentivize employees, officers, consultants, non-employee directors, affiliates and representatives of Ashford LLC, or its affiliates, to achieve our goals and business objectives, as established by our board of directors, in addition to the base fee and the incentive fee described above, our board of directors has the authority to make equity awards to Ashford LLC or directly to employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors of Ashford LLC, or its affiliates, based on our achievement of certain financial and other hurdles established by our board of directors. These annual equity awards are intended to provide an incentive to Ashford LLC and its employees to promote the success of our business. The compensation committee of our board of directors has full discretion regarding the grant of any annual equity awards, and other than the overall limitation on the total number of shares that are authorized to be granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the Advisor Equity Incentive Plan, there are no limitations on the amount of these equity awards.


• | Expense Reimbursement. Ashford LLC is responsible for all wages, salaries, cash bonus payments and benefits related to its employees providing services to us (including any of our officers who are also employees or officers of Ashford LLC), with the exception of any equity compensation that may be awarded by us to the employees of Ashford LLC, or its affiliates, who provide services to us, the provision of certain internal audit, asset management and risk management services and the international office expenses described below.

In addition, we pay a pro rata share of Ashford LLC’s office overhead and administrative expenses incurred in the performance of its duties and functions under the advisory agreement. There is no specific limitation on the amount of such reimbursements.
In addition to the expenses described above, we are required to reimburse Ashford LLC monthly for our pro rata share (as reasonably agreed to between Ashford LLC and a majority of our independent directors or our audit committee, chairman of our audit committee or lead director) of (i) employment expenses of Ashford LLC’s internal audit managers, insurance advisory and other Ashford LLC employees who are actively engaged in providing internal audit services to us, (ii) the reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses of Ashford LLC relating to the activities of its internal audit employees and the reasonable third-party expenses which Ashford LLC incurs in connection with its provision of internal audit services to us and (iii) all reasonable international office expenses, overhead, personnel costs, travel and other costs directly related to Ashford LLC’s non-executive personnel who are located internationally or that oversee the operations of international assets or related to our advisor’s personnel that source, investigate or provide diligence services in connection with possible acquisitions or investments internationally. Such expenses shall include but are not limited to salary, wage payroll taxes and the cost of employee benefit plans.

• | Additional Services. If, and to the extent that, we request Ashford LLC to render services on our behalf other than those required to be rendered by it under the advisory agreement, such additional services shall be compensated separately at market rates, as defined in the advisory agreement.

Assignment. Ashford LLC may assign its rights under the agreement without our approval to any affiliate under the control of Ashford Inc.
Relationship with the Advisor. Ashford LLC is a subsidiary of Ashford Inc. and advises us and Ashford Trust. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 8% of the equity of Ashford Inc., Ashford LLC’s parent company, and Ashford Trust held approximately 25% of the equity of Ashford Inc., on a fully diluted basis. Ashford LLC, its equity holders and employees are permitted to have other advisory clients, which may include other REITs operating in the real estate industry. If we materially revise our initial investment guidelines without the express written consent of Ashford LLC, Ashford LLC will use its best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to us and other entities it advises, taking into account such factors as it deems relevant, in its discretion, subject to any then existing obligations of Ashford LLC to such other entities. We have agreed that we will not revise our initial investment guidelines to be directly competitive with the investment guidelines of Ashford Trust as of November 19, 2013. The advisory agreement gives us the right to equitable treatment with respect to other clients of Ashford LLC, but does not give us the right to preferential treatment, except that Ashford LLC and Ashford Trust have agreed that, so long as we have not materially changed our initial investment guidelines without the express consent of Ashford LLC, any individual hotel investment opportunities that satisfy our investment focus will be presented to our board of directors, who will have up to 10 business days to accept such opportunity prior to it being available to Ashford Trust or any other entity advised by Ashford LLC.
To minimize conflict between us and Ashford Trust, the advisory agreement requires us to designate an investment focus by targeted RevPAR, segments, markets and other factors or financial metrics. After consultation with Ashford LLC, we may modify or supplement our investment guidelines from time to time by giving written notice to Ashford LLC; however, if we materially change our investment guidelines without the express consent of Ashford LLC, Ashford LLC will use its best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to us and Ashford Trust, taking into account such factors as it deems relevant, in its discretion, subject to any then existing obligations of Ashford LLC to other entities. In the advisory agreement, we declared our initial investment guidelines to be hotel real estate assets primarily consisting of equity or ownership interests, as well as debt investments when such debt is acquired with the intent of obtaining an equity or ownership interest, in:

• | full service hotels and resorts with trailing 12 month average RevPAR or anticipated 12 month average RevPAR of at least twice the then-current U.S. national average RevPAR for all hotels as determined with reference to the most current Smith Travel Research reports, generally in the 20 most populous metropolitan statistical areas, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau and delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget;


• | luxury hotels and resorts meeting the RevPAR criteria set forth above and situated in markets that may be generally recognized as resort markets; and


• | international hospitality assets predominantly focused in areas that are general destinations or in close proximity to major transportation hubs or business centers, such that the area serves as a significant entry or departure point to a foreign country or region of a foreign country for business or leisure travelers and meet the RevPAR criteria set forth above (after any applicable currency conversion to U.S. dollars).

When determining whether an asset satisfies our investment guidelines, Ashford LLC must make a good faith determination of projected RevPAR, taking into account historical RevPAR as well as such additional considerations as conversions or reposition 
24

of assets, capital plans, brand changes and other factors that may reasonably be forecasted to raise RevPAR after stabilization of such initiative.
If we elect to spin-off, carve-out, split-off or otherwise consummate a transfer of a division or subset of assets for the purpose of forming a joint venture, a newly created private platform or a new publicly traded company to hold such division or subset of assets constituting a distinct asset type and/or investment guidelines, we have agreed that any such new entity will be advised by Ashford LLC pursuant to an advisory agreement containing substantially the same material terms set forth in our advisory agreement.
If we desire to engage a third party for services or products (other than services exclusively required to be provided by our property managers), Ashford LLC has the exclusive right to provide such services or products at typical market rates provided that we are able to control the award of the applicable contract. Ashford LLC will have at least 20 days after we give notice of the terms and specifications of the products or services that we intend to solicit to provide such services or products at market rates, as determined by reference to fees charged by third-party providers who are not discounting their fees as a result of fees generated from other sources. If a majority of our independent directors determine that Ashford LLC’s pricing proposal is not at market rates, we are required to engage a consultant to determine the market rate for the services or products in question. We will be required to pay for the services of the consultant and to engage Ashford LLC at the market rates determined by the consultant if the consultant finds that the proposed pricing of Ashford LLC was at or below market rates. Alternatively, Ashford LLC will pay the consultant’s fees and will have the option to provide the services or product at the market rates determined by the consultant should the consultant find that the proposed pricing was above market rates.
To minimize conflicts between us and Ashford LLC on matters arising under the advisory agreement, the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any waiver, consent, approval, modification, enforcement matters or elections which the Company may make pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreement shall be within the exclusive discretion and control of a majority of the independent members of our board of directors (or higher vote thresholds specifically set forth in such agreements). In addition, our board of directors has established a Related Party Transaction Committee comprised solely of independent members of our board of directors to review all related party transactions that involve conflicts. The Related Party Transaction Committee may make recommendations to the independent members of our board of directors (including rejection of any proposed transaction). All related party transactions are approved by either the Related Party Transaction Committee or the independent members of our board of directors.
ERFP Agreement
General. On January 15, 2019, we entered into the ERFP Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated January 15, 2019, with the other parties to our advisory agreement. The independent members of our board of directors and the independent members of the board of directors of Ashford Inc., with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the ERFP Agreement on our behalf and on behalf of Ashford Inc., respectively. The ERFP Agreement replaced the “key money investments” previously contemplated by our advisory agreement.
Under the ERFP Agreement, Ashford LLC agreed to provide $50 million to us in connection with our acquisition of additional hotels recommended by Ashford LLC, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the ERFP Agreement, Ashford LLC is obligated to provide us with 10% of the acquired hotel’s purchase price in exchange for FF&E at our properties, which is subsequently leased by Ashford LLC to our TRSs on a rent-free basis. As a result of the Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe acquisition, we are entitled to receive $10.3 million from Ashford LLC in the form of future purchases of hotel FF&E at Braemar hotel properties that will be leased to us by Ashford LLC rent free.
Under the ERFP Agreement, we must provide reasonable advance notice to Ashford LLC to request ERFP funds in accordance with the ERFP Agreement. The ERFP Agreement requires that Ashford LLC acquire the related FF&E either at the time of the property acquisition or at any time generally within two years of our acquisition of the hotel property. 
Conditions to Funding. Ashford LLC has no obligation to provide any enhanced return investment in the event that (i) we or our subsidiaries, as applicable, has materially breached any provision of the advisory agreement (provided that we shall be entitled to cure any such breach prior to the applicable date of required acquisition of FF&E), (ii) any event or condition has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur which would give rise to a right of termination in favor of Ashford LLC under the advisory agreement or the ERFP Agreement, (iii) there would exist, immediately after such proposed enhanced return investment, a Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as defined in the ERFP Agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of Enhanced Return Hotel Assets sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale), or (iv) (a) Ashford LLC’s Unrestricted Cash Balance (as defined below) is, after taking into account the cash amount anticipated to be required for the proposed enhanced return investment, less than fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) (the “Cash Threshold”) as of one week after the date that Braemar OP requires that Ashford LLC commit to fund an enhanced return investment with respect to an Enhanced Return Hotel Asset or (b) Ashford LLC reasonably expects, in light of its then-anticipated contractual funding 
25

commitments (including amounts committed pursuant to the ERFP Agreement but not yet paid) and cash flows, to have an Unrestricted Cash Balance that is less than the Cash Threshold immediately after the expected date of closing of the purchase of the Enhanced Return Hotel Asset.
For purposes of the ERFP Agreement, “Unrestricted Cash Balance” means, unrestricted cash of Ashford LLC; provided, that any cash or working capital of Ashford Inc. or its other subsidiaries, including without limitation, Ashford Hospitality Services LLC (“Ashford Services”), will be included in the calculation of “Unrestricted Cash Balance” if such funds have been contributed, transferred or loaned from Ashford LLC to Ashford Services or such other subsidiaries for the purpose of avoiding, hindering or delaying Ashford LLC’s obligations under the ERFP Agreement (it being understood that good faith loans or advances to, or investments in, Ashford Services’ or such other subsidiaries’ existing business or new services or other businesses, or the provision of working capital to Ashford Services or such other subsidiaries generally consistent with Ashford Services’ or such other subsidiaries past practices, will not be deemed to have been made for the purpose of avoiding, hindering or delaying Ashford LLC’s obligations under the ERFP Agreement).
Repayment Events. With respect to any acquisition of FF&E by Ashford LLC pursuant to the ERFP Agreement, if prior to the date that is two years after such acquisition, (i) we are subject to a Company Change of Control (as defined in the advisory agreement) or (ii) we or Ashford Inc. terminates the advisory agreement and we are required to pay the Termination Fee thereunder (each of clauses (i) and (ii), a “Repayment Event”), Braemar OP is required to pay to Ashford LLC an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of any enhanced return investments actually funded by Ashford LLC during such two year period.
Disposition of Enhanced Return Hotel Assets. If Braemar OP or its subsidiaries dispose of or cause to be disposed any Enhanced Return Hotel Asset or other real property with respect to which Ashford LLC owns FF&E, including by way of a foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure by a mortgage or mezzanine lender of Braemar OP or its subsidiaries, we will promptly identify, and Ashford LLC will acquire, in exchange for such FF&E, FF&E for use at another real property asset leased by the applicable TRS and with a fair market value equal to the value of such FF&E as established in connection with such disposition.
Term. The initial term of the ERFP Agreement is two (2) years (the “Initial Term”), which began January 19, 2019, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ERFP Agreement. At the end of the Initial Term, the ERFP Agreement will automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (each such period a “Renewal Term”) unless either we or Ashford Inc., as applicable, provides written notice to the other at least sixty (60) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, that such notifying party intends not to renew the ERFP Agreement. The ERFP Agreement may be terminated by us in the event we have a right to terminate the advisory agreement or by Ashford Inc. in the event that it is entitled to transfer cash owned by us but controlled by our advisor to the Termination Fee Escrow Account (as defined in the advisory agreement). The amendments to the advisory agreement set forth in the ERFP Agreement will continue in force notwithstanding any termination of the ERFP Agreement.
\Hotel Management Agreements
General
For us to qualify as a REIT, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any of our hotel properties. Third parties must operate our hotel properties. Our hotel properties are leased to TRS lessees (except for the Ritz-Carlton, St. Thomas, which is owned by a TRS), which in turn have engaged property managers to manage our hotel properties. Each of our hotel properties other than the Pier House Resort, the Bardessono Hotel and Hotel Yountville (which are operated by Remington Lodging) are operated pursuant to a hotel management agreement with one of four independent hotel management companies: (1) Hilton Management LLC, (2) Marriott Hotel Services, Inc. or its affiliates, Courtyard Management Corporation, Ritz-Carlton (Virgin Islands), Inc. and Renaissance Hotel Management Company, LLC, (3) Accor and (4) Hyatt Hotels Corporation. Courtyard by Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance are registered trademarks of affiliates of Marriott and Sofitel is a registered trademark of affiliates of Accor.

The hotel management agreements allow each hotel to operate under the Courtyard, Marriott, Renaissance, Hilton, Sofitel or Hyatt brand names, as applicable, and provide benefits typically associated with franchise agreements, including, among others, the use of the Marriott, Hilton, Sofitel or Hyatt, as applicable, reservation system and guest loyalty and reward program. Any intellectual property and trademarks of Marriott, Hilton, Accor or Hyatt, as applicable, are exclusively owned and controlled by 
28

the applicable manager or an affiliate of such manager who grants the manager rights to use such intellectual property or trademarks with respect to the applicable hotel.
Below is a summary of the principal terms of the hotel management agreements with Marriott, Hilton, Accor, Hyatt and Remington.
Marriott Management Agreements
Term. The remaining base term of each of our six Marriott management agreements ranges from approximately 9 to 47 years, expiring between December 31, 2027 and December 31, 2065. Each of these agreements has remaining automatic extension options at the discretion of the manager, ranging from two 10-year extension to five 10-year extensions.
Events of Default. An “Event of Default” under the Marriott hotel management agreements is generally defined to include the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party, the failure to make a payment under the hotel management agreement and failure to cure such non-payment after due notice, and a breach by either party of any other covenants or obligations in the hotel management agreement which continues beyond the applicable notice and cure period.
Termination Upon Event of Default. A non-defaulting party may terminate the hotel management agreement upon an Event of Default (as defined in the applicable hotel management agreement) generally after the expiration of any notice and cure periods; provided, however, the hotel management agreement may not be terminated by the non-defaulting party unless and until such Event of Default has a material adverse effect on the non-defaulting party. In the case of the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown, if the defaulting party contests such Event of Default or such material adverse effect, we may not terminate unless a court of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, binding and non-appealable order finding that the Event of Default has occurred and that the default resulted in a material adverse effect.
Early Termination for Casualty. The termination provisions for our hotel properties in the event of casualty are summarized as follows:

• | Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown: If damage or destruction to the hotel from any cause materially and adversely affects the operation of the hotel and we fail to promptly commence and complete the repair, rebuilding or replacement of the same to bring it back to substantially its prior condition, manager may, at its option, terminate the management agreement by written notice.


• | Courtyard San Francisco Downtown; Seattle Marriott Waterfront and Ritz-Carlton, St. Thomas: If the hotel suffers a total casualty (meaning the cost of the damage to be repaired or replaced would be equal to 30% (60% for Ritz-Carlton, St. Thomas) or more of the then total replacement cost of the hotel), then either party may terminate the hotel management agreement.

Early Termination for Condemnation. If all or substantially all of the hotel is taken in any condemnation or similar proceeding, or a portion of the hotel is so taken, and the result is that it is unreasonable to continue to operate the hotel in accordance with the hotel management agreement, the hotel management agreement shall terminate.
Performance Termination. All of the Marriott hotel management agreements are structured to provide us with a right to terminate the hotel management agreement without the payment of a termination fee if the manager fails to achieve certain criteria relating to the performance of the hotel managed by Marriott. The performance period is measured with respect to any two consecutive fiscal years. The performance criteria generally includes each of the following: (i) operating profit for each such fiscal year is less than the applicable performance termination threshold (as defined in the hotel management agreement) which ranges from 9.5% to 10.25% of the approximate total investment in the hotel, and in the case of the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown is 85% of the owner’s priority return (as defined in the hotel management agreement), (ii) the RevPAR penetration index of the hotel during each such fiscal year is less than the revenue index threshold (as such terms are defined in the hotel management agreements) which range from 0.85 to 1.00, and (iii) the fact that the criteria set forth in (i) or (ii) is not the result of an extraordinary event or force majeure, any major renovation of the hotel adversely affecting a material portion of the income generating areas (or any major renovation with respect to the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown), or any default by us under the hotel management agreement. The manager has a right to avoid a performance termination by paying to us the total amount by which the operating profit for each of the fiscal years in question was less than the performance termination threshold for such fiscal years, or in the case of Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown, by waiving base management fees until such time as the total amount of waived base management fees equals the shortfall of operating profit for each of the fiscal years in question to the performance termination threshold for such fiscal years.
Limitation on Termination Rights. Our ability to exercise termination rights is subject to certain limitations if the manager or any of its affiliates are providing certain credit enhancements, loans or fundings as described in the hotel management agreement, or in certain cases, if manager’s incentive management fee is outstanding.
29

Assignment and Sale. Each Marriott management agreement provides that we cannot sell the applicable hotel property to any unrelated third party or engage in certain change of control actions if (i) we are in default under the hotel management agreement, (ii) such party is known to be of bad moral character or has been convicted of a felony or is in control of or controlled by persons who have been convicted of felonies, (iii) such party does not (in the reasonable judgment of manager) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to fulfill our obligations under the hotel management agreement, (iv) such party has an ownership interest, either directly or indirectly, in a brand or group of hotels totaling at least 10 hotels and such brand or group competes with the manager or Marriott or any affiliate thereof, or (v) with respect to the Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown, such party is a “specially designated national or blocked person” as designated by the applicable governmental entity. Any sale of the property (which includes any equity transfer, whether directly or indirectly) is subject to certain conditions, including the provision of notice of such sale to the manager.
Right of First Offer. All of the Marriott management agreements provide Marriott with a right of first negotiation with respect to a sale of the hotel (which includes the equity transfer of a controlling interest in the owner of the hotel property, whether directly or indirectly). A sale or transfer to an affiliate is specifically excluded from this right. After notice of a proposed sale to the manager, we have a specified time period, ranging from 20 to 45 days, to negotiate an acceptable purchase and sale agreement. If after such time period no agreement is signed, we are free to sell or lease the hotel to a third party, subject to certain conditions, such as providing notice of sale to the manager (with certain details regarding the terms of sale). The manager then has a specified time period, ranging from 20 to 45 days, depending on our compliance with the assignment and sale provisions above, to either consent to such sale or not consent to such sale. If the manager does not timely respond or does not consent to such sale, certain of the management agreements provide that the sale must occur 180 days after provision of the notice of sale or the notice of sale is deemed void and we must provide a new notice to the manager.
Hilton Management Agreements
Term. The base term of each of our two Hilton management agreements was 10 years, expiring December 31, 2013. Each of these agreements has been extended through December 31, 2023 and has three 10-year automatic extension options remaining, at the discretion of the manager.
Events of Default. An “Event of Default” under the Hilton hotel management agreements is generally defined to include the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party, the failure to make a payment under the hotel management agreement and failure to cure such non-payment after due notice, a breach by either party of any other covenants or obligations in the hotel management agreement which continues beyond the applicable notice and grace period, failure to maintain certain alcohol licenses and permits under certain circumstances, failure by us to provide manager with sufficient working capital to operate the hotel after due notice and a termination of our operating lease due to our default under the operating lease.
Termination Upon Event of Default. If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any applicable notice and cure periods set forth in the hotel management agreement, the non-defaulting party generally has, among other remedies, the option of terminating the applicable hotel management agreement upon written notice to the defaulting party.
Performance Termination. Each of the Hilton management agreements provide us with a right to terminate the hotel management agreement without the payment of a termination fee if the manager fails to achieve certain criteria relating to the performance of the hotel managed by Hilton. The performance period is measured with respect to any two consecutive fiscal years. The performance criteria are: (i) the hotel’s operating cash flow (before deducting our priority return) does not equal or exceed 85% of the our priority return (as defined in the hotel management agreement); and (ii) the hotel’s yield index is below the base yield index (as such terms are defined in the hotel management agreement), which is 90%. The manager has a right to avoid a performance termination by paying to us an amount within 30 days of due notice equal to the deficiency set forth in (i) above to cure such performance default, but in no event may the manager exercise such cure with respect to more than four full operating years during the initial term or with respect to more than four full operating years during any single extension term. The amount of any shortfall payable by manager to us shall be reduced to the extent of any portion attributable to a force majeure event, performance of certain capital renewals and major capital improvements adversely affecting a material portion of the income generating areas of the hotel, or certain uncontrollable expenses that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the manager.
Early Termination for Casualty. In the event the applicable hotel is substantially damaged by fire or other casualty such that it cannot be restored within 240 days, or in the event our lender doesn’t provide adequate insurance proceeds to restore the hotel, we may terminate the hotel management agreement. If we undertake to restore the hotel or if we are required to restore the hotel because it was not substantially damaged and fail to commence such repairs within 60 days of receiving sufficient insurance proceeds to complete such work, or fail to complete such repairs within 240 days of the casualty, the manager may terminate the agreement. We have no obligation to restore the premises, however, if the casualty occurs in the last five years of the third renewal term or thereafter.
30

Early Termination for Condemnation. If all or substantially all of the applicable hotel is taken in any condemnation or similar proceeding which, in our reasonable opinion, makes it infeasible to restore or continue to operate the hotel in accordance with the hotel management agreement, the hotel management agreement shall terminate. If it is reasonably feasible to restore the premises and operate the hotel and we fail to complete the restoration within two years of the taking, the manager may terminate the agreement. We have no obligation to restore the premises, however, if the taking occurs in the last five years of the third renewal term or thereafter.
Assignment and Sale. Each Hilton management agreement provides that we cannot sell the applicable hotel to any unrelated third party, which includes the transfer of an equity interest, or engage in certain change of control actions (i) if such party has an ownership interest, either directly or indirectly, in a brand of hotels totaling at least 10 hotels and such brand competes with the manager or Hilton or any affiliate thereof; (ii) if such party is known to be of ill repute or an unsuitable business associate (per gaming industry regulations where the manager holds a gaming license); (iii) if such party does not have the ability to fulfill our financial obligations under the hotel management agreement; or (iv) if certain conditions are not satisfied, including cure of any existing or potential defaults, receipt of evidence of proper insurance coverage, payment of fees and expenses which will accrue to the manager through the date of closing, and provision of sufficient notice of the contemplated sale to the manager.
Right of First Offer. Each of the Hilton management agreements provides the manager with a right of first negotiation with respect to a sale of the hotel (which includes any equity transfer, whether directly or indirectly) or lease of the hotel (if applicable). After notice of a proposed sale or lease to the manager, the manager has 30 days to elect or decline to exercise its right to purchase or lease. If the manager makes an election to purchase or lease, the parties have 30 days to execute an agreement for purchase (or lease, if applicable) and an additional 30 days to consummate the purchase or lease (if applicable). If the manager declines to exercise its right to purchase or lease, the sale or lease must occur within 180 days at greater than 90% of the price or the notice of sale must be renewed to manager.
Accor Management Agreement
In connection with our acquisition of the Chicago Sofitel Magnificent Mile, our TRS lessee, as lessee of the hotel, assumed a management agreement with Accor that allows us to operate under the Sofitel brand name and utilize Accor’s services and experience in connection with the management and operation of the Chicago Sofitel Magnificent Mile. The material terms of the agreement are summarized as follows:
Term. The initial term of the management agreement expires on December 31, 2030 and automatically renews for three consecutive 10-year renewal terms, unless the manager terminates the agreement by written notice at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.
Events of Default. An “Event of Default” is generally defined to include the failure to make a payment under the management agreement and failure to cure such non-payment after the applicable notice and cure period, the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party, a failure by either party to maintain at all times all of the insurance required to be maintained by such party and failure to cure such default after the applicable notice and cure period, the failure by either party to perform any of the material covenants in the hotel management agreement which continues beyond the applicable notice and cure period and a transfer of the agreement by either party in violation of the provisions of the agreement. The occurrence of an Event of Default prevents the defaulting party from transferring the agreement without the consent of the non-defaulting party.
Termination. A non-defaulting party may terminate the hotel management agreement if the defaulting party (i) has breached any material representation or fails to perform any material provision of the agreement or (ii) becomes insolvent or bankrupt, in each case after the expiration of any applicable notice and cure period. In addition, the manager may terminate the agreement if we default under a mortgage relating to the hotel and fail to cure such default within the times provided.
Performance Termination. We have the right to terminate the hotel management agreement without the payment of a termination fee if the manager fails to achieve certain criteria relating to the performance of the hotel managed by Accor. The performance period is measured with respect to any two consecutive operating years. The performance criteria are: (i) the RevPAR for the hotel is less than 90% of the RevPAR for the hotel’s competitive set for each such operating year and (ii) the adjusted net operating income less the hurdle amount of $9.0 million plus 8% of any amounts we spent on capital expenditures is a negative number (i.e. less than zero) for each such operating year, provided that for any operating year in which the operation of the hotel is materially and adversely affected by a force majeure event, a refurbishing program or major capital improvements, the RevPAR for the hotel and the adjusted net operating income for such operating years shall be adjusted equitably. The manager will have a right up to three times in any eight-year period to avoid a performance termination by paying to us a cure amount that equals, for any operating year, the lower of (i) the amount by which the adjusted net operating income is less than zero and (ii) the amount that we would have been entitled to receive as a distribution from the hotel had the hotel not had a RevPAR shortfall.
31

Early Termination for Condemnation. If all of the hotel, or a portion of the hotel that in our reasonable opinion makes it imprudent or unsuitable to use and operate the remaining portion of the hotel in accordance with the standards maintained by the Sofitel brand, is taken in any condemnation or similar proceeding, we may terminate the agreement.
Early Termination for Casualty. If a material part of the hotel is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, then we may terminate the agreement and elect not to restore the hotel. If we elect to restore the hotel, we must commence such process within 120 days after the date of the casualty and diligently proceed with the restoration of the hotel so that it meets the standards maintained by the Sofitel brand. If we fail to complete the restoration within two years after the date of the casualty, then for so long as such failure continues, the manager may terminate the management agreement. If we or the manager terminate the management agreement because of a casualty, if we have not restored the hotel and desire to lease or sell it, we must first offer to sell the hotel to the manager. If we repair, rebuild or replace the premises within five years, the manager may reinstate the agreement.
Assignment and Sale. So long as we are not in default under the management agreement and any advances made by the manager on our behalf would be repaid in connection with the sale, we may sell the Chicago Sofitel Magnificent Mile and assign the management agreement (including as a result of a change of control) without the consent of the manager to any of our affiliates or to any person that (i) is not a competitor of the manager (as defined in the management agreement), (ii) is not generally recognized in the community as being a person of ill repute or with whom a prudent business person would not wish to associate in a commercial venture and (iii) has a minimum net worth required by the management agreement, if the assignee expressly assumes the management agreement.
Hyatt Beaver Creek Management Agreement
Term. The base term of our Hyatt Beaver Creek management agreement is 30 years, expiring December 31, 2019 and has two 10-year extension options remaining, at the discretion of the manager.
Events of Default. An “Event of Default” under the Hyatt Beaver Creek hotel management agreement is generally defined to include the failure to make a payment under the hotel management agreement and failure to cure such non-payment after due notice and a breach by either party of any other covenants or obligations in the hotel management agreement which continues beyond the applicable notice and grace period.
Termination Upon Event of Default. If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any applicable notice and cure periods set forth in the hotel management agreement, the non-defaulting party generally has, among other remedies, the option of terminating the applicable hotel management agreement upon fifteen days’ written notice to the defaulting party.
Early Termination for Casualty. In the event the applicable hotel is substantially damaged by fire or other casualty, and if, in connection with any casualty, the cost of restoring the hotel equals or exceeds 25% of the replacement cost of the hotel in the case that the casualty is covered by insurance, or 10% of the replacement cost of the hotel in the case that the casualty is not covered by insurance, then we may elect, by providing notice to Hyatt within 90 days of the occurrence of the casualty to not restore the hotel and to terminate the agreement.
Early Termination for Eminent Domain. If all or substantially all of the hotel is taken in any eminent domain procedure so as to render the hotel untenantable, we have the right to terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Hyatt. 
Assignment and Sale. The agreement provides that we cannot sell or assign our interest in the hotel without the prior approval of Hyatt, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Hyatt’s approval of a sale or assignment is based on the following factors: (i) the ability of the prospective assignee to fulfill the financial obligations of the owner of the hotel; (ii) the integrity and business reputation of the prospective assignee; and (iii) any potential conflicts of interest which may arise in connection with the assignment. Pursuant to the agreement, an assignment is deemed to have occurred if more than 40% of the beneficial ownership of the owner of the hotel is transferred.
Remington Lodging Hotel Master Property Management Agreement
General. Upon completion of the spin-off, we entered into a hotel master management agreement with Remington Lodging governing the terms of Remington Lodging’s provision of property management services and project management services with respect to hotels owned or leased by us. In connection with Ashford Inc.’s acquisition of Premier from Remington Lodging in August 2018, we amended and restated the original hotel master management agreement to provide only for property management services to be provided to our TRSs by Remington Lodging by entering into the Amended and Restated Hotel Master Management Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018, which agreement we refer to below as the “master property management agreement.” Pursuant to the master property management agreement, Remington Lodging currently manages the Pier House Resort, the Bardessono Hotel and Hotel Yountville. The master property management agreement will also govern the management of hotels we acquire in the future that are managed by Remington Lodging, which has the right to manage and operate hotel properties we 
32

acquire in the future unless our independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Remington Lodging, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Remington Lodging because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in our best interest not to engage Remington Lodging for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Remington Lodging, another manager or developer could perform the management duties materially better than Remington Lodging for the particular hotel. See “Certain Agreements—Mutual Exclusivity Agreements—Remington Lodging Property Management MEA—Exclusivity Rights of Remington Lodging.” Remington Lodging is owned 100% by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, chairman of our board of directors and the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Ashford Trust, and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. 
Term. The master property management agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Remington Lodging, at its option, subject to certain performance tests, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Remington Lodging is not then in default under the master property management agreement. If at the time of the exercise of any renewal period, Remington Lodging is in default, then the exercise of the renewal option will be conditional on timely cure of such default, and if such default is not timely cured, then our TRS lessee may terminate the master property management agreement regardless of the exercise of such option and without the payment of any fee or liquidated damages. If Remington Lodging desires to exercise any option to renew, it must give our TRS lessee written notice of its election to renew the master property management agreement no less than 90 days before the expiration of the then current term of the master property management agreement.
Amounts Payable under the Master Property Management Agreement. Remington Lodging receives a base management fee, and if the hotels meet and exceed certain thresholds, an additional incentive fee. The base management fee for each hotel will be due monthly and will be equal to the greater of:

• | $13,869 (increased annually based on consumer price index adjustments); or


• | 3% of the gross revenues associated with that hotel for the related month.

The incentive management fee, if any, for each hotel will be due annually in arrears within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year and will be equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of gross revenues and (ii) the amount by which the actual house profit (gross operating profit of the applicable hotel before deducting management fees or franchise fees) exceeds the target house profit as set forth in the annual operating budget approved for the applicable fiscal year. If, however, based on actual operations and revised forecasts from time to time, it is reasonably anticipated that the incentive fee is reasonably expected to be earned, the TRS lessee will consider payment of the incentive fee pro rata on a quarterly basis.
The incentive fee is designed to encourage Remington Lodging to generate higher house profit at each hotel by increasing the fee due to Remington Lodging when the hotels generate house profit above certain threshold levels. Any increased revenues will generate increased lease payments under the percentage leases and should thereby benefit our stockholders.
Termination. The master property management agreement may be terminated as to one or more of the hotels earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including:

• | a sale of a hotel;


• | the failure of Remington Lodging to satisfy certain performance standards;


• | for the convenience of our TRS lessee;


• | in the event of a casualty to, condemnation of, or force majeure involving a hotel; or


• | upon a default by Remington Lodging or us that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods.

In certain cases of early termination of the master property management agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, we must pay Remington Lodging termination fees, plus any amounts otherwise due to Remington Lodging pursuant to the terms of the master property management agreement. We will be obligated to pay termination fees in the circumstances described below, provided that Remington Lodging is not then in default, subject to certain cure and grace periods:

• | Sale. If any hotel subject to the Remington master property management agreement is sold during the first 12 months of the date such hotel becomes subject to the master property management agreement, our TRS lessee may terminate the master property management agreement with respect to such sold hotel, provided that it pays to Remington Lodging an amount equal to the management fee (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be payable to Remington Lodging with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then current annual operating budget for the balance of the first year of the term. If any hotel subject to the master property management agreement is sold at any time after the first year of the term and the TRS lessee terminates the master management agreement with respect to such hotel, our TRS lessee will have no obligation to pay any termination fees.

33


• | Casualty. If any hotel subject to the master property management agreement is the subject of a casualty during the first year of the initial 10-year term and the TRS lessee elects not to rebuild, then we must pay to Remington Lodging the termination fee, if any, that would be owed if the hotel had been sold. However, after the first year of the initial 10-year term, if a hotel is the subject of a casualty and the TRS lessee elects not to rebuild the hotel even though sufficient casualty insurance proceeds are available to do so, then the TRS lessee must pay to Remington Lodging a termination fee equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be paid to Remington Lodging with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) by (ii) nine.


• | Condemnation or Force Majeure. In the event of a condemnation of, or the occurrence of any force majeure event with respect to, any of the hotels, the TRS lessee has no obligation to pay any termination fees if the master management agreement terminates as to those hotels.


• | Failure to Satisfy Performance Test. If any hotel subject to the master property management agreement fails to satisfy a certain performance test, the TRS lessee may terminate the master property management agreement with respect to such hotel, and in such case, the TRS lessee must pay to Remington Lodging an amount equal to 60% of the product obtained by multiplying (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be paid to Remington Lodging with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) by (ii) nine. Remington Lodging will have failed the performance test with respect to a particular hotel if during any fiscal year during the term (i) such hotel’s gross operating profit margin for such fiscal year is less than 75% of the average gross operating profit margins of comparable hotels in similar markets and geographical locations, as reasonably determined by Remington Lodging and the TRS lessee, and (ii) such hotel’s RevPAR yield penetration is less than 80%. Upon a performance test failure, the TRS lessee must give Remington Lodging two years to cure. If, after the first year, the performance test failure has not been cured, then the TRS lessee may, in order not to waive any such failure, require Remington Lodging to engage a consultant with significant hotel lodging experience reasonably acceptable to both Remington Lodging and the TRS lessee, to make a determination as to whether or not another management company could manage the hotel in a materially more efficient manner. If the consultant’s determination is in the affirmative, then Remington Lodging must engage such consultant to assist with the cure of such performance failure for the second year of the cure period after that failure. If the consultant’s determination is in the negative, then Remington Lodging will be deemed not to be in default under the performance test. The cost of such consultant will be shared by the TRS lessee and Remington Lodging equally. If Remington Lodging fails the performance test for the second year of the cure period and, after that failure, the consultant again makes a finding that another management company could manage the hotel in a materially more efficient manner than Remington Lodging, then the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the management agreement with respect to such hotel upon 45 days’ written notice to Remington Lodging and to pay to Remington Lodging the termination fee described above. Further, if any hotel subject to the Remington management agreement is within a cure period due to a failure of the performance test, an exercise of a renewal option shall be conditioned upon timely cure of the performance test failure, and if the performance failure is not timely cured, the TRS lessee may elect to terminate the management agreement without paying any termination fee.


• | For Convenience. With respect to any hotel managed by Remington Lodging pursuant to the master property management agreement, if the TRS lessee elects for convenience to terminate the management of such hotel, at any time, including during any renewal term, the TRS lessee must pay a termination fee to Remington Lodging, equal to the product of (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees for such hotel (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be payable to Remington Lodging with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) and (ii) nine.

If the master property management agreement terminates as to all of the hotels covered in connection with a default under the master property management agreement, the property management MEA can also be terminated at the non-defaulting party’s election. See “Certain Agreements—Mutual Exclusivity Agreements—Remington Lodging Property Management MEA.”
Maintenance and Modifications. Remington Lodging must maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and make such routine maintenance, repairs and minor alterations as it deems reasonably necessary. The cost of all such routine maintenance, repairs and alterations will be paid by the TRS lessee. All non-routine repairs and maintenance, either to a hotel or its fixtures, furniture and equipment pursuant to the capital improvement budget described below, will be managed by Premier pursuant to the master project management agreement.
Insurance. Remington Lodging must coordinate with the TRS lessee the procurement and maintenance of all workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, and other appropriate and customary insurance related to its operations as a property manager, the cost of which is the responsibility of the TRS lessee.
34

Assignment and Subleasing. Neither Remington Lodging nor the TRS lessee may assign or transfer the master property management agreement without the other party’s prior written consent. However, Remington Lodging may assign its rights and obligations to an affiliate that satisfies the eligible independent contractor requirements and is “controlled” by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., or their respective family partnerships or trusts, the sole members or beneficiaries of which are at all times lineal descendants of Messrs. Monty or Archie Bennett, Jr. (including step children) and spouses. “Controlled” means (i) the possession of a majority of the capital stock (or ownership interest) and voting power of such affiliate, directly or indirectly, or (ii) the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such affiliate in the capacity of chief executive officer, president, chairman, or other similar capacity where they are actively engaged or involved in providing such direction or control and spend a substantial amount of time managing such affiliate. No assignment will release Remington Lodging from any of its obligations under the master management agreement.
Damage to Hotels. If any of our insured properties is destroyed or damaged, the TRS lessee is obligated, subject to the requirements of the underlying lease, to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the hotel to the same condition as existed prior to such damage or destruction. If the lease relating to such damaged hotel is terminated pursuant to the terms of the lease, the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the master management agreement with respect to such damaged hotel upon 60 days’ written notice. In the event of a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington Lodging will have any further liabilities or obligations under the master property management agreement with respect to such damaged hotel, except that we may be obligated to pay to Remington Lodging a termination fee, as described above. If the management agreement remains in effect with respect to such damaged hotel, and the damage does not result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee’s obligation to pay management fees will be unabated. If, however, the master management agreement remains in effect with respect to such damaged hotel, but the damage does result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee will be entitled to partial, pro rata abatement of the management fees while the hotel is being repaired.
Condemnation of a Property or Force Majeure. If all or substantially all of a hotel is subject to a total condemnation or a partial taking that prevents use of the property as a hotel, the master property management agreement, with respect to such hotel, will terminate, subject to the requirements of the applicable lease. In the event of termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington Lodging will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the master property management agreement with respect to such hotel. If any partial taking of a property does not make it unreasonable to continue to operate the hotel, there is no right to terminate the master property management agreement. If there is an event of force majeure or any other cause beyond the control of Remington Lodging that directly involves a hotel and has a significant adverse effect upon the continued operations of that hotel, then the master property management agreement may be terminated by the TRS lessee. In the event of such a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington Lodging will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the master property management agreement with respect to such hotel.
Annual Operating Budget. The master property management agreement provides that not less than 45 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year during the term of the master property management agreement, Remington Lodging will submit to the TRS lessee for each of the hotels, an annual operating budget setting forth in detail an estimated profit and loss statement for each of the next 12 months (or for the balance of the fiscal year in the event of a partial first fiscal year), including a schedule of hotel room rentals and other rentals and a marketing and business plan for each of the hotels. The budget is subject to the TRS lessee approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld. The budget may be revised from time to time, taking into account such circumstances as the TRS lessee deems appropriate or as business and operating conditions shall demand, subject to the reasonable approval of Remington Lodging.
Capital Improvement Budget. Remington Lodging must prepare a capital improvement budget of the expenditures necessary for replacement of FF&E and building repairs for the hotels during the following fiscal year and provide such budget to the relevant TRS lessee and landlord for approval at the same time Remington Lodging submits the proposed annual operating budget for approval by TRS lessee. Remington Lodging may not make any other expenditures for these items without the relevant TRS lessee and landlord approval, except expenditures which are provided in the capital improvements budget or are required by reason of any (i) emergency, (ii) applicable legal requirements, (iii) the terms of any franchise agreement or (iv) are otherwise required for the continued safe and orderly operation of our hotels.
Indemnity Provisions. Remington Lodging has agreed to indemnify the TRS lessee against all damages not covered by insurance that arise from: (i) the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Remington Lodging subject to certain limitations; (ii) infringement by Remington Lodging of any third party’s intellectual property rights; (iii) employee claims based on a substantial violation by Remington Lodging of employment laws or that are a direct result of the corporate policies of Remington Lodging; (iv) the knowing or reckless placing, discharge, leakage, use or storage of hazardous materials in violation of applicable environmental laws on or in any of our hotels by Remington Lodging; or (v) the breach by Remington Lodging of the master property management agreement, including action taken by Remington Lodging beyond the scope of its authority under the master property management agreement, which is not cured.
35

Except to the extent indemnified by Remington Lodging as described in the preceding paragraph, the TRS lessee will indemnify Remington Lodging against all damages not covered by insurance and that arise from: (i) the performance of Remington Lodging’s services under the master property management agreement; (ii) the condition or use of our hotels; (iii) certain liabilities to which Remington Lodging is subjected, including pursuant to the WARN Act, in connection with the termination of the master property management agreement; (iv) all employee cost and expenses; or (v) any claims made by an employee of Remington Lodging against Remington Lodging that are based on a violation or alleged violation of the employment laws.
Events of Default. Events of default under the master property management agreement include:

• | The TRS lessee or Remington Lodging files a voluntary bankruptcy petition, or experiences a bankruptcy-related event not discharged within 90 days.


• | The TRS lessee or Remington Lodging fails to make any payment due under the master management agreement, subject to a 10-day notice and cure period.


• | The TRS lessee or Remington Lodging fails to observe or perform any other term of the master property management agreement, subject to a 30-day notice and cure period. There are certain instances in which the 30-day notice and cure period can be extended to up to 120 days.


• | Remington Lodging does not qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” as such term is defined in Section 856(d)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.

If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any grace period, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the master property management agreement, on 30 days’ notice to the other party.
To minimize conflicts between us and Remington Lodging on matters arising under the master property management agreement, the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any waiver, consent, approval, modification, enforcement matters or elections which the Company may make pursuant to the terms of the master property management agreement shall be within the exclusive discretion and control of a majority of the independent members of the board of directors (or higher vote thresholds specifically set forth in such agreements). In addition, our board of directors has established a Related Party Transaction Committee comprised solely of independent members of our board of directors to review all related party transactions that involve conflicts. The Related Party Transaction Committee may make recommendations to the independent members of our board of directors (including rejection of any proposed transaction). All related party transactions are approved by either the Related Party Transaction Committee or the independent members of our board of directors.
Premier Master Project Management Agreement
General. Upon completion of the spin-off, we entered into a hotel master management agreement with Remington Lodging governing the terms of Remington Lodging’s provision of property management services and project management services with respect to hotels owned or leased by us. In connection with Ashford Inc.’s acquisition of Premier from Remington Lodging in August 2018, Braemar OP, our TRSs and Premier entered into an agreement for project management services to be provided to us by Premier, solely in order to effect the transfer of the project management business to Premier, by entering into the Master Project Management Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018, which agreement we refer to below as the “master project management agreement.” Pursuant to the master project management agreement, Premier currently provides project management services to all of our hotels. The master project management agreement will also govern the provision of project management services to hotels we acquire in the future, as Premier has the right to provide project management services to hotel properties we acquire in the future, to the extent we have the right and/or control the right to direct the development and construction of and/or capital improvements to or refurbishment of, such hotels, unless our independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Premier, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Premier because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in our best interest not to engage Premier for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Premier, another manager or developer could perform the project management, project related services or development duties materially better than Premier for the particular hotel. See “Certain Agreements—Mutual Exclusivity Agreements—Premier Project Management MEA—Exclusivity Rights of Premier.”
Term. The master project management agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement; provided that the initial term of the master project agreement with respect to hotels owned or leased by us as of the date of the master project management agreement shall be until January 17, 2029. The term may be renewed by Premier, at its option, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Premier is not then in default under the master project management agreement. If at the time of the exercise of any renewal period, Premier is in default, then the exercise of the renewal option will be conditional on timely cure of such default, and if such default is not timely cured, then our TRS lessee may terminate the master project management agreement regardless of the exercise of such option and without the payment of any fee or liquidated damages. If Premier desires to exercise 
36

any option to renew, it must give our TRS lessee written notice of its election to renew the master project management agreement no less than 90 days before the expiration of the then current term of the master project management agreement.
Amounts Payable under the Master Project Management Agreement. The master project management agreement provides that the TRS lessee will pay Premier a project management fee equal to 4% of the total project costs associated with the implementation of the approved capital improvement budget for a hotel until such time that the capital improvement budget and/or renovation project costs involve expenditures in excess of 5% of gross revenues of such hotel, whereupon the project management fee will be 3% of total project costs in excess of the 5% of gross revenue threshold. In addition, the TRS lessee will pay Premier additional fees as follows:
•architecture - 6.5% of total construction costs;
•construction management - 10.0% of total construction costs (for projects without a general contractor);

• | interior design - 6.0% of the amount selected (including the cost of any and all items selected by Premier or which are specified in the general contractor’s scope of work but excluding any associated charges for labor, freight and tax); and


• | FF&E purchasing - 8.0% of the purchased amount (which includes the selected items, freight and tax) unless the total purchased amount for a single hotel property in a single year is greater than $2.0 million, in which case the fee is reduced to 6.0% of the purchased amount in excess of $2 million.

Termination. The master project management agreement may be terminated as to one or more of the hotels earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including:

• | a sale of a hotel;


• | for the convenience of our TRS lessee;


• | in the event of a casualty to, condemnation of, or force majeure involving a hotel; or


• | upon a default by Premier or us that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods.

In certain cases of early termination of the master project management agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, we must pay Premier termination fees, plus any amounts otherwise due to Premier pursuant to the terms of the master project management agreement. We will be obligated to pay termination fees in the circumstances described below, provided that Premier is not then in default, subject to certain cure and grace periods:

• | Sale. If any hotel subject to the master project management agreement is sold, our TRS lessee may terminate the master project management agreement with respect to such sold hotel, and our TRS lessee will have no obligation to pay any termination fees.


• | Casualty, Condemnation or Force Majeure. In the event of a casualty with respect to, condemnation of, or the occurrence of any force majeure event with respect to, any of the hotels, the TRS lessee has no obligation to pay any termination fees if the master project management agreement terminates as to those hotels.


• | For Convenience. With respect to any hotel project-managed by Premier pursuant to the master project management agreement, if the TRS lessee elects for convenience to terminate the project management of such hotel, at any time, including during any renewal term, the TRS lessee must pay a termination fee to Premier, equal to the product of (i) 65% of the aggregate project management fees and market service fees for such hotel estimated to be payable to Premier with respect to the applicable hotel for the full current fiscal year in which such termination is to occur (but in no event less than the project management fees and market service fees for the preceding full fiscal year) and (ii) nine.

Implementation of Capital Improvement Budget. Premier, on behalf of TRS lessee, shall cause to be made non-routine repairs and other work, either to the hotel’s building or its FF&E, pursuant to the capital improvement budget prepared by Remington Lodging pursuant to the master property management agreement and approved by TRS lessee.
Insurance. Premier must coordinate with the TRS lessee the procurement and maintenance of all general compensation, employer’s liability, and other appropriate and customary insurance related to its operations as a project manager, the cost of which is the responsibility of the TRS lessee.
Assignment and Subleasing. Neither Premier nor the TRS lessee may assign or transfer the master project management agreement without the other party’s prior written consent. However, Premier may assign its rights and obligations to any entity that is “controlled” by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., or their respective family partnerships or trusts, the sole members or beneficiaries of which are at all times lineal descendants of Messrs. Monty or Archie Bennett, Jr. (including step children) and spouses. “Controlled” means (i) the possession of a majority of the capital stock (or ownership interest) and voting power of such affiliate, directly or indirectly, or (ii) the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such affiliate in the capacity of chief executive officer, president, chairman, or other similar capacity where they are actively 
37

engaged or involved in providing such direction or control and spend a substantial amount of time managing such affiliate. No assignment will release Remington Lodging from any of its obligations under the master management agreement.
Damage to Hotels. If any of our insured properties is destroyed or damaged, the TRS lessee is obligated, subject to the requirements of the underlying lease, to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the hotel to the same condition as existed prior to such damage or destruction. If the lease relating to such damaged hotel is terminated pursuant to the terms of the lease, the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the master project management agreement with respect to such damaged hotel upon 60 days’ written notice. In the event of a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington Lodging will have any further liabilities or obligations under the master project management agreement with respect to such damaged hotel.
Condemnation of a Property or Force Majeure. If all or substantially all of a hotel is subject to a total condemnation or a partial taking that prevents use of the property as a hotel, the master project management agreement, with respect to such hotel, will terminate, subject to the requirements of the applicable lease. In the event of termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Premier will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the master project management agreement with respect to such hotel. If any partial taking of a property does not make it unreasonable to continue to operate the hotel, there is no right to terminate the master project management agreement. If there is an event of force majeure or any other cause beyond the control of Premier that directly involves a hotel and has a significant adverse effect upon the continued operations of that hotel, then the master project management agreement may be terminated by the TRS lessee. In the event of such a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Premier will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the master project management agreement with respect to such hotel.
Indemnity Provisions. Premier has agreed to indemnify the TRS lessee against all damages not covered by insurance that arise from: (i) the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Premier; (ii) infringement by Premier of any third party’s intellectual property rights; (iii) the knowing or reckless placing, discharge, leakage, use or storage of hazardous materials in violation of applicable environmental laws on or in any of our hotels by Premier; or (iv) the breach by Premier of the master project management agreement, including action taken by Premier beyond the scope of its authority under the master project management agreement, which is not cured.
Except to the extent indemnified by Premier as described in the preceding paragraph, the TRS lessee will indemnify Premier against all damages not covered by insurance and that arise from: (i) the performance of Premier’s services under the master project management agreement; or (ii) the condition or use of our hotels.
Events of Default. Events of default under the master project management agreement include:

• | The TRS lessee or Premier files a voluntary bankruptcy petition, or experiences a bankruptcy-related event not discharged within 90 days.


• | The TRS lessee or Premier fails to make any payment due under the master project management agreement, subject to a 10-day notice and cure period.


• | The TRS lessee or Premier fails to observe or perform any other term of the master project management agreement, subject to a 30-day notice and cure period. There are certain instances in which the 30-day notice and cure period can be extended to up to 120 days.

If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any grace period, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the master project management agreement, on 30 days’ notice to the other party.
To minimize conflicts between us and Premier on matters arising under the master project management agreement, the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any waiver, consent, approval, modification, enforcement matters or elections which the Company may make pursuant to the terms of the master project management agreement shall be within the exclusive discretion and control of a majority of the independent members of the board of directors (or higher vote thresholds specifically set forth in such agreements). In addition, our board of directors has established a Related Party Transaction Committee comprised solely of independent members of our board of directors to review all related party transactions that involve conflicts. The Related Party Transactions Committee may make recommendations to the independent members of our board of directors (including rejection of any proposed transaction). All related party transactions are approved by either the Related Party Transaction Committee or the independent members of our board of directors.
Mutual Exclusivity Agreements
Remington Lodging Property Management MEA
General. Upon completion of the spinoff, we entered into a mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging. Remington Lodging gave us a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of 
38

its affiliates that met our initial investment criteria, and we agreed to engage Remington Lodging to provide property management, project management and development services for hotels we acquired or invested in, to the extent that we had the right or controlled the right to direct such matters, subject to certain conditions. In connection with Ashford Inc.’s acquisition of Premier from Remington Lodging in August 2018, we amended and restated the original mutual exclusivity agreement to provide that Remington Lodging gave us a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of its affiliates that met our initial investment criteria, and we agreed to engage Remington Lodging to provide property management for hotels we acquired or invested in, to the extent that we had the right or controlled the right to direct such matters. As a result, concurrently with Ashford Inc.’s acquisition of Premier, we, Braemar OP and Remington Lodging entered into the Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018, which agreement we refer to below as the “property management MEA.”
Term. The initial term of the property management MEA is 10 years from November 19, 2013. This term automatically extends for three additional renewal periods of seven years each and a final renewal period of four years, for a total of up to 35 years. The agreement may be sooner terminated because of:

• | an event of default (see “Events of Default”),


• | a party’s early termination rights (see “Early Termination”), or


• | a termination of all our master property management agreement between TRS lessee and Remington Lodging because of an event of default under the master property management agreement that affects all properties (see “Relationship with Master Property Management Agreement”).

Modification of Investment Guidelines. In the event that we materially modify our initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington Lodging, which consent may be withheld at its sole and absolute discretion, and may further be subject to the consent of Ashford Trust parties, the Remington Lodging parties will have no obligation to present or offer us investment opportunities at any time thereafter. Instead, the Remington Lodging parties, subject to the superior rights of the Ashford Trust parties or any other party with which the Remington Lodging parties may have an existing agreement, shall use their reasonable discretion to determine how to allocate investment opportunities it identifies. In the event we materially modify our investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington Lodging, the Ashford Trust parties will have superior rights to investment opportunities identified by the Remington Lodging parties, and we will no longer retain preferential treatment to investment opportunities identified by the Remington Lodging parties. A material modification for this purpose means any modification of our initial investment guidelines to be competitive with Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines.
Our Exclusivity Rights. Remington Lodging and Mr. Monty Bennett have granted us a first right of refusal to pursue certain lodging investment opportunities identified by Remington Lodging or its affiliates (including Mr. Bennett), including opportunities to buy hotel properties, to buy land and build hotels, or to otherwise invest in hotel properties that satisfy our initial investment guidelines and are not considered excluded transactions pursuant to the property management MEA. If investment opportunities are identified and are subject to the property management MEA, and we have not materially modified our initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington Lodging, then Remington Lodging, Mr. Bennett and their affiliates, as the case may be, will not pursue those opportunities (except as described below) and will give us a written notice and description of the investment opportunity, and we will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the investment opportunity. If we reject the opportunity, Remington Lodging may then pursue such investment opportunity, subject to a right of first refusal in favor of Ashford Trust pursuant to an existing agreement between Ashford Trust and Remington Lodging, on materially the same terms and conditions as offered to us. If the terms of such investment opportunity materially change, then Remington Lodging must offer the revised investment opportunity to us, whereupon we will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the opportunity on the revised terms.
Reimbursement of Costs. If we accept an investment opportunity from Remington Lodging, we will be obligated to reimburse Remington Lodging or its affiliates for the actual out-of-pocket and third-party costs and expenses paid by Remington Lodging or its affiliates in connection with such investment opportunity, including any earnest money deposits, but excluding any finder’s fee, brokerage fee, development fee or other compensation paid by Remington Lodging or its affiliates. Remington Lodging must submit to us an accounting of the costs in reasonable detail.
Exclusivity Rights of Remington Lodging. If we elect to pursue an investment opportunity that consists of the management and operation of a hotel property, we will hire Remington Lodging to provide such services unless our independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Remington Lodging, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Remington Lodging because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in our best interest not to engage Remington Lodging for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Remington Lodging, another manager or developer could perform the management duties materially better than Remington Lodging for the particular hotel. In return, Remington Lodging has agreed that it will provide those services.
39

Excluded Investment Opportunities. The following are excluded from the property management MEA and are not subject to any exclusivity rights or right of first refusal:

• | With respect to Remington Lodging, an investment opportunity where our independent directors have unanimously voted not to engage Remington Lodging as the manager or developer.


• | With respect to Remington Lodging, an investment opportunity where our independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Remington Lodging as the manager or developer based on their determination, in their reasonable business judgment, that special circumstances exist such that it would be in our best interest not to engage Remington Lodging with respect to the particular hotel.


• | With respect to Remington Lodging, an investment opportunity where our independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Remington Lodging as the manager or developer because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that another manager or developer could perform the management, development or other duties materially better than Remington Lodging for the particular hotel, based on Remington Lodging’s prior performance.


• | Existing hotel investments of Remington Lodging or its affiliates with any of their existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners.


• | Existing bona fide arm’s length third-party management arrangements (or arrangements for other services) of Remington Lodging or any of its affiliates with third parties other than us and our affiliates.


• | Like-kind exchanges made pursuant to existing contractual obligations by any of the existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners in which Remington Lodging or its affiliates have an ownership interest, provided that Remington Lodging provides us with notice 10 days’ prior to such transaction.

Management or Development. If we hire Remington Lodging to manage or operate a hotel, it will be pursuant to the terms of the master property management agreement agreed to between us and Remington Lodging. 
Events of Default. Each of the following is a default under the property management MEA:

• | we or Remington Lodging experience a bankruptcy-related event;


• | we fail to reimburse Remington Lodging as described under “Reimbursement of Costs,” subject to a 30-day cure period; and


• | we or Remington Lodging does not observe or perform any other term of the agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period (which may be increased to a maximum of 120 days in certain instances).

If a default occurs, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the property management MEA subject to 30 days’ written notice and pursuing its rights and remedies under applicable law.
Early Termination. Remington Lodging has the right to terminate the exclusivity rights granted to us if:

• | Mr. Monty J. Bennett is removed as our chief executive officer or as chairman of our board of directors or is not re-appointed to either position, or he resigns as chief executive officer or chairman of our board of directors;


• | we terminate the Remington Lodging exclusivity rights pursuant to the terms of the property management MEA; or


• | our advisory agreement with Ashford LLC is terminated for any reason pursuant to its terms and Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer serving as our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors.

We may terminate the exclusivity rights granted to Remington Lodging if:

• | Remington Lodging fails to qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in Section 856(d)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and for that reason, we terminate the master management agreement with Remington Lodging;


• | Remington Lodging is no longer “controlled” by Mr. Monty Bennett or his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. or their respective family partnership or trusts, the sole members of which are at all times lineal descendants of Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. or Mr. Monty Bennett (including step children) and spouses;


• | we experience a change in control and terminate the master property management agreement between us and Remington Lodging with respect to all hotels and have paid a termination fee equal to the product of (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees budgeted in the annual operating budget applied to the hotels for the full current fiscal year in which such termination is to occur for such hotels (both base fees and incentive fees, but in no event less than the base fees and incentive fees for the preceding full fiscal year) and (ii) nine;


• | the Remington Lodging parties terminate our exclusivity rights pursuant to the terms of the mutual exclusivity agreement; or


• | our advisory agreement with Ashford LLC is terminated for any reason pursuant to its terms and Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer serving as our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors.

40

Assignment. The property management MEA may not be assigned by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided that Remington Lodging can assign its interest in the property management MEA, without the written consent of the other parties, to a “manager affiliate entity” as that term is defined in the agreement, so long as such affiliate qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” at the time of such transfer.
Relationship with Master Property Management Agreement. The rights provided to us and to Remington Lodging in the property management MEA may be terminated if the master property management agreement between us and Remington Lodging terminates in its entirety because of an event of default as to all of the then-managed properties. A termination of Remington Lodging’s management rights with respect to one or more hotels (but not all hotels) does not terminate the property management MEA. A termination of the property management MEA does not terminate the master property management agreement either in part or in whole, and the master property management agreement would continue in accordance with its terms as to the hotels covered, despite a termination of the property management MEA.
Premier Project Management MEA
General. In connection with Ashford Inc.’s acquisition of Premier from Remington Lodging in August 2018, we entered into the Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018 with Braemar OP and Premier, which agreement we refer to below as the “project management MEA”, pursuant to which Premier gave us a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Premier and any of its affiliates that met our initial investment criteria, and we agreed to engage Premier to provide project management for hotels we acquired or invested in, to the extent that we had the right or controlled the right to direct such matters. 
Term. The initial term of the project management MEA is 10 years from November 19, 2013. This term automatically extends for three additional renewal periods of seven years each and a final renewal period of four years, for a total of up to 35 years. The agreement may be sooner terminated because of:

• | an event of default (see “Events of Default”),


• | a termination of all our master project management agreements between the TRS lessee and Premier because of an event of default under the master project management agreement that affects all properties (see “Relationship with Master Project Management Agreement”).

Modification of Investment Guidelines. In the event that we materially modify our initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Premier, which consent may be withheld at its sole and absolute discretion, Premier will have no obligation to present or offer us investment opportunities at any time thereafter pursuant to the project management MEA. Instead, Premier shall allocate investment opportunities it identifies pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement. A material modification for this purpose means any modification of our initial investment guidelines to be competitive with Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines.
Our Exclusivity Rights. Premier and its affiliates have granted us a first right of refusal to pursue certain lodging investment opportunities identified by Premier and its affiliates (including Mr. Bennett), including opportunities to buy hotel properties, to buy land and build hotels, or to otherwise invest in hotel properties that satisfy our initial investment guidelines and are not considered excluded transactions pursuant to the project management MEA. If investment opportunities are identified and are subject to the project management MEA, and we have not materially modified our initial investment guidelines, then Premier and its affiliates, as the case may be, will not pursue those opportunities (except as described below) and will give us a written notice and description of the investment opportunity, and we will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the investment opportunity. If we reject the opportunity, Premier may then pursue such investment opportunity, on materially the same terms and conditions as offered to us. If the terms of such investment opportunity materially change, then Premier and its affiliates must offer the revised investment opportunity to us, whereupon we will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the opportunity on the revised terms.
Reimbursement of Costs. If we accept an investment opportunity from Premier, we will be obligated to reimburse Premier or its affiliates for the actual out-of-pocket and third-party costs and expenses paid by Premier or its affiliates in connection with such investment opportunity, including any earnest money deposits, but excluding any finder’s fee, brokerage fee, development fee or other compensation paid by Premier or its affiliates. Premier must submit to us an accounting of the costs in reasonable detail.
Exclusivity Rights of Premier. If we acquire or invest in a hotel or a property for the development or construction of a hotel and have the right and/or control the right to direct the development and construction of and/or capital improvements to or refurbishment of, or the provision of project management or other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, or construction management for such hotel or hotel improvements, we will hire Premier to provide such services unless our independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Premier, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Premier 
41

because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in our best interest not to engage Premier for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Premier, another manager or developer could perform the project management, project related services or development duties materially better than Premier for the particular hotel. In return, Premier has agreed that it will provide those services.
Excluded Investment Opportunities. The following are excluded from the project management MEA and are not subject to any exclusivity rights or right of first refusal:

• | With respect to Premier, an investment opportunity where our independent directors have unanimously voted not to engage Premier as the manager or developer.


• | With respect to Premier, an investment opportunity where our independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Premier as the manager or developer based on their determination, in their reasonable business judgment, that special circumstances exist such that it would be in our best interest not to engage Premier with respect to the particular hotel.


• | With respect to Premier, an investment opportunity where our independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Premier as the manager or developer because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that another manager or developer could perform the project management, project related services or development duties materially better than Premier for the particular hotel, based on Premier’s prior performance.


• | Existing hotel investments of Premier or its affiliates with any of their existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners.


• | Existing bona fide arm’s length third-party project management arrangements of Premier or any of its affiliates with third parties other than us and our affiliates.


• | Like-kind exchanges made pursuant to existing contractual obligations by any of the existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners in which Remington Lodging or its affiliates have an ownership interest, provided that Remington Lodging provides us with notice 10 days’ prior to such transaction.


• | Any hotel investment that does not satisfy our initial investment guidelines.

Development or Construction. If we hire Remington Lodging to develop and construct a hotel, the terms of the development and construction will be pursuant to the terms of the master project management agreement that has been agreed to by us and Premier.
Events of Default. Each of the following is a default under the project management MEA:

• | we or Premier experience a bankruptcy-related event;


• | we fail to reimburse Premier as described under “Reimbursement of Costs,” subject to a 30-day cure period; and


• | we or Premier does not observe or perform any other term of the agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period (which may be increased to a maximum of 120 days in certain instances).

If a default occurs, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the project management MEA subject to 30 days’ written notice and pursuing its rights and remedies under applicable law.
Assignment. The project management MEA may not be assigned by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided that Premier can assign its interest in the project management MEA, without the written consent of the other parties, to a “manager affiliate entity” as that term is defined in the agreement.
Relationship with Master Project Management Agreement. The rights provided to us and to Premier in the project management MEA may be terminated if the master project management agreement between us and Premier terminates in its entirety because of an event of default as to all of the then-managed properties. A termination of Premier’s project management rights with respect to one or more hotels (but not all hotels) does not terminate the project management MEA. A termination of the project management MEA does not terminate the master project management agreement either in part or in whole, and the management agreements would continue in accordance with its terms as to the hotels covered, despite a termination of the project management MEA.
Ashford Trust Right of First Offer Agreement
The right of first offer agreement provides us the first right to acquire each of the subject hotels owned by Ashford Trust, to the extent the board of directors of Ashford Trust determines to market and sell the hotel, subject to any prior rights of the managers of the hotel or other third parties and the limitations with respect to hotels in a joint venture set forth in the right of first offer agreement. In addition, so long as we do not materially change our initial investment guidelines without the express consent of 
42

Ashford LLC, the right of first offer agreement extends to hotels later acquired by Ashford Trust that satisfy our initial investment guidelines. 
If Ashford Trust decides to offer for sale an asset that fits our investment guidelines, it must give us a written notice describing the sale terms and granting us the right to purchase the asset at a purchase price equal to the price set forth in the offer. We will have 30 days to agree to the terms of the sale. If terms are not met, Ashford Trust will be free to sell the asset to any person upon substantially the same terms as those contained in the written notice for 180 days, but not for a price less than 95% of the offered purchase price. If during such 180-day period, Ashford Trust desires to accept an offer that is not on substantially the same terms as those contained in the written notice or that is less than 95% of the offered purchase price, Ashford Trust must give us written notice of the new terms and we will have 10 days in which to agree to the terms of the sale. If Ashford Trust does not close on the sale or refinancing of the asset within 180 days following the expiration of the initial 30-day period, the right to purchase the asset will be reinstated on the same terms.
Likewise, we have agreed to give Ashford Trust a right of first offer with respect to any properties that we acquire in a portfolio transaction, to the extent our board of directors determines it is appropriate to market and sell such assets and we control the disposition, provided such assets satisfy Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines. Any such right of first offer granted to Ashford Trust will be subject to certain prior rights, if any, granted to the managers of the related properties or other third parties.
The right of first offer agreement has an initial term of 10 years and is subject to automatic one year renewal periods unless one party notifies the other at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the current term that it does not intend to renew the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by either party (i) upon a default of the other party upon giving notice of such default and the defaulting party fails to cure within 45, or in some circumstances up to 90, days subject to certain exclusions, and (ii) if the other party experiences specified bankruptcy events. Also, if we materially modify our initial investment guidelines without consent of Ashford Trust (which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion), our right of first refusal for any assets owned or later acquired by Ashford Trust and its affiliates, other than the initial assets subject to the right of first offer agreement, will terminate unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Further, the agreement will automatically terminate upon a termination of our advisory agreement or upon a change of control of either us or Ashford Trust, excluding any change of control that may occur as a result of a spin-off, carve-out, split-off or other similar event.
TRS Leases
Three of the hotels we acquired from Ashford Trust in connection with the spin-off are owned by our operating partnership and leased to subsidiaries of Braemar TRS. Two of our hotels are held in a joint venture in which we have a 75% equity interest. The two hotels owned by the joint venture are leased to subsidiaries of the joint venture, which two subsidiaries we have elected to treat as TRSs. Since 2013 Braemar TRS has formed multiple subsidiaries which lease acquired hotels. Braemar TRS has elected to be treated as a TRS. Generally, we intend to lease all hotels we acquire in the future, other than pursuant to sale-leaseback transactions with unrelated third parties, to a TRS lessee, pursuant to the terms of leases that are generally similar to the terms of the existing leases, unless not appropriate based on relevant regulatory factors. Ashford LLC will negotiate the terms and provisions of each future lease, considering such things as the purchase price paid for the hotel, then current economic conditions and any other factors deemed relevant at the time.
Term. The leases for six of our hotel properties include a term of five years, which began on January 1, 2018 and expires on December 31, 2022, except in the case of the Chicago Sofitel Magnificent Mile, which began on February 24, 2014 and expires on March 31, 2019, the Bardessono Hotel, which began on July 9, 2015 and expires on December 31, 2020, the Park Hyatt Beaver Creek, which began on March 31, 2017 and expires on December 31, 2021, the Hotel Yountville, which began on May 11, 2017 and expires on December 31, 2021, the Ritz-Carlton, Sarasota, which began on April 4, 2018 and expires on December 31, 2022 and the Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe, which began on January 15, 2019 and expires on December 31, 2023. The leases may be terminated earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including specified damages to the related hotel, a condemnation of the related hotel or the sale of the related hotel, or an event of default that is not cured within any applicable cure or grace periods. The lessor must pay a termination fee to the TRS lessee if and to the extent the TRS lessee is obligated to pay a termination fee to the managers as a result of the termination of the lease.
Amounts Payable Under Leases. The leases generally provide for each TRS lessee to pay in each calendar month the base rent plus, in each calendar quarter, percentage rent, if any. The percentage rent for each hotel equals: (i) an agreed percentage of gross revenue that exceeds a threshold amount, less (ii) all prior percentage rent payments.
Maintenance and Modifications. Each TRS lessee is required to establish and fund, in respect of each fiscal year during the terms of the leases, a reserve account, in the amount of at least 4% of gross revenues per year to cover the cost of capital expenditures, which costs will be paid by our operating partnership. Each TRS lessee shall be required to make (at our sole cost and expense) all capital expenditures required in connection with emergency situations, legal requirements, maintenance of the applicable franchise agreement, the performance by lessee of its obligations under the lease and other permitted additions to the leased 
43

property. We also have the right to make additions, modifications or improvements so long as our actions do not significantly alter the character or purposes of the property, significantly detract from the value or operating efficiency of the property, significantly impair the revenue producing capability of the property or affect the ability of the lessee to comply with the terms of their lease. All capital expenditures relating to material structural components involving expenditures of $1 million or more are subject to the approval of our operating partnership. Each TRS lessee is responsible for all routine repair and maintenance of the hotels, and our operating partnership will be responsible for non-routine capital expenditures.
We own substantially all personal property (other than inventory, linens, ERFP FF&E and other nondepreciable personal property) not affixed to, or deemed a part of, the real estate or improvements on our hotels, unless ownership of such personal property would cause the rent under a lease not to qualify as “rents from real property” for REIT income test purposes. See “Federal Income Tax Consequences of Our Status as a REIT—Income Tests.”
Insurance and Property Taxes. We pay real estate and personal property taxes on the hotels (except to the extent that personal property associated with the hotels is owned by the applicable TRS lessee). We pay for property and casualty insurance relating to the hotel properties and any personal property owned by us. Each TRS lessee pays for all insurance on its personal property, comprehensive general public liability, workers’ compensation, vehicle, and other appropriate and customary insurance. Each TRS lessee must name us as an additional insured on any policies it carries.
Assignment and Subleasing. The TRS lessees are not permitted to sublet any part of the hotels or assign their respective interests under any of the leases without our prior written consent, which cannot be unreasonably withheld. No assignment or subletting will release any TRS lessee from any of its obligations under the leases.
Damage to Hotels. If any of our insured hotels is destroyed or damaged, whether or not such destruction or damage prevents use of the property as a hotel, the applicable TRS lessee will have the obligation, but only to the extent of insurance proceeds that are made available, to restore the hotel. All insurance proceeds will be paid to our operating partnership (except such proceeds payable for loss or damage to the TRS lessee’s personal property) and be paid to the applicable TRS lessee for the reasonable costs of restoration or repair. Any excess insurance proceeds remaining after the cost of repair or restoration will be retained by us. If the insurance proceeds are not sufficient to restore the hotel, the TRS lessee or we have the right to terminate the lease upon written notice. In that event, neither we nor the TRS lessee will have any further liabilities or obligations under the lease, except that, if we terminate the lease, we have to pay the TRS lessee termination fees, if any, within 45 days that become due under the management agreement. If the lease is so terminated, we will keep all insurance proceeds received as a result of such destruction or damage. If the lease is terminated by a TRS lessee, we have the right to reject the termination of the lease and to require the TRS lessee to restore the hotel, provided we agree to pay for all restoration costs in excess of available insurance proceeds. In that event, the related lease will not terminate and we will pay all insurance proceeds to the TRS lessee.
If the cost of restoration exceeds the amount of insurance proceeds, we will contribute any excess amounts necessary to complete the restoration to the TRS lessee before requiring the work to begin. In the event of damage or destruction not covered by insurance, our obligations, as well as those of the applicable TRS lessee, will be the same as in the case of inadequate insurance proceeds. However, regardless of insurance coverage, if damage or destruction rendering the property unsuitable for its primary intended purpose occurs within 24 months of the end of the lease term, we may terminate the lease with 30 days’ notice. If the lease remains in effect and the damage does not result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee’s obligation to pay rent will be unabated. If, however, the lease remains in effect but the damage does result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee will be entitled to a certain amount of rent abatement while the hotel is being repaired. We will keep all proceeds from loss of income insurance.
Condemnation. If any of our hotels is subject to a total condemnation or a partial taking that prevents use of the property as a hotel, we and the TRS lessee each have the option to terminate the related lease. We will share in the condemnation award with the TRS lessee in accordance with the provisions of the related lease. If any partial taking of a hotel does not prevent use of the property as a hotel, the TRS lessee is obligated to restore the untaken portion of the hotel to a complete architectural unit but only to the extent of any available condemnation award. If the condemnation award is not sufficient to restore the hotel, the TRS lessee or we have the right to terminate the lease upon written notice. If the lease is terminated by the TRS lessee, we have the right to reject the termination of the lease within 30 days and to require the TRS lessee to restore the hotel, provided we agree to pay for all restoration costs in excess of the available condemnation award. We will contribute the cost of such restoration to the TRS lessee. If a partial taking occurs, the base rent will be abated to some extent, taking into consideration, among other factors, the number of usable rooms, the amount of square footage, or the revenues affected by the partial taking.
Events of Default. Events of Default under the leases include:

• | The TRS lessee fails to pay rent or other amounts due under the lease, provided that the TRS lessee has a 10-day cure period after receiving a written notice from us that such amounts are due and payable before an event of default would occur.

44


• | The TRS lessee does not observe or perform any other term of a lease, provided that the TRS lessee has a 30-day cure period after receiving a written notice from us that a term of the lease has been violated before an event of default of default would occur. There are certain instances in which the 30-day grace period can be extended to a maximum of 120 days.


• | The TRS lessee is the subject of a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, liquidation or dissolution event.


• | The TRS lessee voluntarily ceases operations of the hotels for a period of more than 30 days, except as a result of damage, destruction, condemnation, or certain specified unavoidable delays.


• | The default of the TRS lessee under the management agreement for the related hotel because of any action or failure to act by the TRS lessee and the TRS lessee has failed to cure the default within 30 days.

If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any grace period, we have the option of terminating the related lease. If we decide to terminate a lease, we must give the TRS lessee 10 days’ written notice. Unless the event of default is cured before the termination date we specify in the termination notice, the lease will terminate on the specified termination notice. In that event, the TRS lessee will be required to surrender possession of the related hotel and pay liquidated damages at our option, as provided by the applicable lease.
Termination of Leases. Our operating partnership generally has the right to terminate any lease prior to the expiration date so long as we pay a termination fee. The termination fee is equal to any termination fee due to a manager under the management agreement.
Indemnification. Each TRS lessee is required to indemnify us for claims arising out of (i) accidents occurring on or about the leased property, (ii) any past, present or future use or condition of the hotel by TRS lessee or any of its agents, employees or invitees, (iii) any impositions that are the obligation of the TRS hotel by lessee, (iv) any failure of the TRS lessee to perform under the lease, and (v) the non-performance of obligations under any sub-lease by the landlord thereunder. We are required to indemnify each TRS lessee for any claim arising out of our gross negligence or willful misconduct arising in connection with the lease and for any failure to perform our obligations under the lease. All indemnification amounts must be paid within 10 days of a determination of liability.
Breach by Us. If we breach any of the leases, we will have 30 days from the time we receive written notice of the breach from the TRS lessee to cure the breach. This cure period may be extended in the event of certain specified, unavoidable delays.
Ground Leases
Two of our hotels are subject to ground leases that cover the land underlying the respective hotels.
Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. The Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines is subject to a ground lease with the City of San Diego and expires May 31, 2067. The lease term may be extended by either 10 years or 20 years depending on the amount of capital spent at the hotel. If 5% of gross income is spent on capital expenditures during the lease term, the term may be extended by 10 years. If 6% of gross income is spent on capital expenditures during the lease term, the term may be extended by 20 years. Rent is payable monthly and is the greater of minimum rent or percentage rent, determined monthly, with an annual true-up. Commencing January 1, 1993 and every five years thereafter, minimum rent is adjusted to be 80% of the annual average of actual rents paid or accrued during the preceding five-year period, but in no event may such rent be adjusted downwards. Percentage rent is determined from a percentage of room and banquet rental revenue, food and beverage sales, alcohol sales, lobby, gift shop and coin operated machine and telephone sales and other authorized uses. Percentage rent is adjusted at least six months prior to the end of (December 31, 2027) and thereafter at least six months prior to each 10th year by mutual agreement to provide fair rental to landlord. The lease may be assigned with the landlord’s prior written consent. Upon any assignment or a sublease of a majority of the Premises, 2% of the gross amounts paid for the assignment or sublease are payable to the Landlord except in the instances of a transfer to an affiliate or a mortgage foreclosure. In addition, 2% of the net proceeds are payable to the Landlord in the event of a refinancing.
Bardessono Hotel. The Bardessono Hotel is subject to a ground lease with Bardessono Brothers LLC and expires October 31, 2065, with two 25-year extension options. Rent is payable monthly and is the greater of minimum rent or percentage rent with an annual true-up on October 1. Each year, annual base minimum rent is increased (but never decreased) by an amount equal to the percentage increase in CPI Index during the prior 12-month period that starts on September 1 and ends on August 31. In no event will the index percentage be less than 101.5% nor more than 103.5% multiplied by the annual base minimum rent payable by tenant during the lease year just ending. A percentage rent, which is calculated on the positive difference (if any) between the greater of 8% of net rooms revenue OR 4.5% of net operating revenue and the aggregate base minimum rent actually paid by the tenant during the same calendar year will be paid on a calendar year basis. Within 90 days after end of calendar year tenant must provide landlord an officer’s certificate containing tenant’s financial statements and percentage rent payment, if any. The lease may be assigned with the landlord’s prior written consent at least 60 days but not more than 90 days before the effective date of the proposed assignment. Tenant must submit to landlord a statement containing contact and financial information, operating and 
45

property ownership history, and other information with respect to the proposed assignee or subtenant as landlord may reasonably require, the type of use proposed for the inn parcel or resort, and all of the principal terms of the proposed assignment; copy of proposed assignment; and a copy of the landlord’s consent to assignment. In August of 2016, the lease was amended to allow for the expansion of the leased premises by 10,000 square feet to accommodate construction of presidential villas.
Regulation
General
Our hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our hotels must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), to the extent that such hotels are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable as well as the provision to persons with disabilities of services equivalent to those provide to guests without disabilities. We believe that our hotels are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotels and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters
Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our hotels may expose us to third-party liability or materially and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral.
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance.
Some of our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our hotels could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at our hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive general liability, “All Risk” property, business interruption, cyber security, rental loss coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all of our hotels and earthquake, wind, flood and hurricane coverage on hotels in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with limits of liability that we deem adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each hotel, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to losses caused by riots, war or acts of God. In the opinion of our management, our hotels are adequately insured.
Competition
The hotel industry is highly competitive and the hotels in which we invest are subject to competition from other hotels for guests. Competition is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, availability of rooms, brand affiliation, price, range of services, guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our properties are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels. Increased 
46

competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and rooms revenue per available room of our hotels or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, which may result in decreases in our profitability.
Our principal competitors include other hotel operating companies, ownership companies and national and international hotel brands. We face increased competition from providers of less expensive accommodations, such as select service hotels or independent owner-managed hotels, during periods of economic downturn when leisure and business travelers become more sensitive to room rates. We also experience competition from alternative types of accommodations such as home sharing companies.
We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from institutional pension funds, private equity funds, REITs, hotel companies and others who are engaged in the acquisition of hotels. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources and access to capital than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and decrease the attractiveness of the terms on which we may acquire our targeted hotel investments, including the cost thereof.
Employees
We have no employees. Our appointed officers are provided by Ashford LLC. Services which would otherwise be provided by employees are provided by employees of Ashford LLC and by our appointed officers. Ashford LLC has approximately 116 full time employees. These employees directly or indirectly perform various acquisition, development, asset management, capital markets, accounting, tax, risk management, legal, redevelopment, and corporate management functions pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement.
Seasonality
Our properties’ operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months and some during the winter months. This seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases. We anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our REIT status. To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue, we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions. However, we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future.
Access to Reports and Other Information
We maintain a website at www.bhrreit.com. On our website, we make available free of charge our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and other reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of our filed reports can also be obtained at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and Board Committee Charters are also available free-of-charge on our website or can be made available in print upon request.
