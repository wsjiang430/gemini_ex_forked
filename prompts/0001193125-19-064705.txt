Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in drug research and development to create new therapies for fibrotic disease, severe skin disease, and cancer. Our drug candidates are based on our method of targeting galectin proteins, which are key mediators of biologic and pathologic functions. We use naturally occurring, readily-available plant products as starting material in manufacturing processes to create proprietary, patented complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights and other pharmaceutical properties. These complex carbohydrate molecules are appropriately formulated into acceptable pharmaceutical formulations. Using these unique carbohydrate-based candidate compounds that largely bind and inhibit galectin proteins, particularly galectin-3, we are undertaking the focused pursuit of therapies for indications where galectins have a demonstrated role in the pathogenesis of a given disease. We focus on diseases with serious, life-threatening consequences to patients and those where current treatment options are limited. Our strategy is to establish and implement clinical development programs that add value to our business in the shortest period of time possible and to seek strategic partners when a program becomes advanced and requires significant additional resources. 
 Our lead galectin-3 inhibitor is GR-MD-02, which has been demonstrated in preclinical models to reverse liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. GR-MD-02 has the potential to treat many diseases due to galectin-3s involvement in multiple key biological pathways such as fibrosis, immune cell function and immunity, cell differentiation, cell growth, and apoptosis (cell death). The importance of galectin-3 in the fibrotic process is supported by experimental evidence. Animals with the gene responsible for galectin-3 knocked-out can no longer develop fibrosis in response to experimental stimuli compared to animals with an intact galectin-3 gene. Galectin Therapeutics Inc. is using its galectin-3inhibitor to treat advanced liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) patients. We have completed two Phase 1 clinical studies, a Phase 2 clinical study in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis (NASH-FX) and a second Phase 2B clinical trial in NASH patients with well compensated cirrhosis. We announced, in December 2017 top line results from our Phase 2b study in NASH patients with cirrhosis (NASH-CX) and results of an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in May 2018which provided direction on potentially acceptable end points for a Phase 3 trial. The company with its external NASH consultants has designed a Phase 3 study which has been sent to various contract research organizations (CROs) for their input on feasibility, timing costs and other important considerations. NASH cirrhosis is a progressive disease, currently not treatable and ultimately may result in liver failure that has poor prognosis and no effective, approved medical therapies other than liver transplant. Galectin-3 expression is highly increased in the liver of patients with liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. We believe that our galectin-3 inhibitor, by reducing galectin-3 at the cellular level, ultimately showing a strong anti-fibrotic potential may provide a novel treatment for various forms of liver fibrosis. 
 We endeavor to leverage our scientific and product development expertise as well as established relationships with outside sources to achieve cost-effective and efficient drug development. These outside sources, amongst others, provide us with expertise in preclinical models, pharmaceutical development, toxicology, clinical trial operations, pharmaceutical manufacturing, sophisticated physical and chemical characterization, and commercial development. We also have established several collaborative scientific discovery programs with leading experts in carbohydrate chemistry and characterization. These discovery programs are generally aimed at the targeted development of new carbohydrate molecules that bind galectin proteins and offer alternative options to larger market segments in our primary disease indications. We also have established through Galectin Sciences LLC, a discovery program aimed at the targeted development of small molecules (generally, non-carbohydrate) that bind galectin proteins and may afford options for alternative means of drug delivery (e.g., oral) and as a result expand the potential uses of our galectin-3 inhibitor compounds. We are also pursuing a development pathway to clinical enhancement and commercialization for our lead compounds in immuno-oncology for cancer therapy. However, our clinical development efforts are focused on both liver fibrosis and fatty liver disease as represented by a Phase 2 clinical trial in NASH-cirrhosis which reported top

  line data in December 2017 and on planning for Phase 3 studies. All of our proposed products are presently in development, including pre-clinical and clinical trials. 
 We were founded in July 2000 as Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation. On April 25, 2001, DTR-Med Pharma Corp. (DTR), which was incorporated in Nevada on January 26, 2001, entered into a stock exchange agreement with Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc., whereby DTR acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On May 10, 2001, DTR changed its name to Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and on June 7, 2001, the Massachusetts corporation was merged into the Nevada corporation. On May 26, 2011, Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its name to Galectin Therapeutics Inc. In October, 2012, we moved our headquarters to a suburb of Atlanta, GA to be closer to a center of discovery collaboration while maintaining a laboratory operation in the Boston area. 
 Our Drug Development Programs 
 Galectins are a class of proteins that are made by many cells in the body, but predominantly in cells of the immune system. As a group, these proteins are able to bind to sugar molecules that are part of other proteins, glycoproteins, in and on the cells of our body. Galectin proteins act as a kind of molecular glue, bringing together molecules that have sugars on them. Galectin proteins, in particular galectin-3, are known to be markedly increased in a number of important diseases including inflammatory diseases, scarring of organs (e.g. liver, lung, kidney, and heart) and cancers of many kinds. The increase in galectin protein promotes the disease and is detrimental to the patient. Published data substantiating the importance of galectin-3 in the fibrotic process arises from gene knockout experiments in animal studies. Mice genetically altered to eliminate the galectin-3 gene, and thus unable to produce galectin-3, are incapable of developing liver fibrosis in response to toxic insult to the liver and in fatty liver disease as well as development of fibrosis in other tissues. 
 We have one new proprietary chemical entity (NCE) in development, GR-MD-02, which has shown promise in preclinical and early clinical studies in treatment of fibrosis, severe skin disease, and in cancer therapy. Currently we are focusing on development of GR-MD-02 intended to be used in the treatment of liver fibrosis associated with fatty liver disease (NASH) and more specifically in NASH cirrhosis. We have also leveraged our relationships with well-known investigators to demonstrate clinical effects of GR-MD-02 in treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, severe atopic dermatitis, and in cancer therapy in combination with immune-system modifying agent(s). GR-MD-02 is a proprietary, patented compound derived from natural, readily available, plant-based starting materials, which, following chemical processing, exhibits the properties of binding to and inhibiting galectin-3 proteins. A second NCE, GM-CT-01 is a proprietary, patented compound that is made from a completely different starting source plant material and also binds and inhibits galectin proteins. Previously in clinical development for cancer indications, GM-CT-01 compound has been explored in limited other preclinical studies.

As part of the planning related to the Phase 3 trial, the Company has had ongoing discussions with FDA regarding Galectins proposal for the next clinical study as well as the overall development program. These ongoing conversations included a recent Type C Meeting via teleconference with the Agency on February 6, 2019, to discuss Galectins proposal for use of progression to varices as the primary surrogate endpoint moving forward. In the meeting, FDA confirmed that the Agency is supportive of the use of progression to varices as a potential surrogate endpoint and progression to large varices as a component of a composite clinical benefit endpoint pending additional requested information. Galectin will address and implement additional FDA requests and considerations for the Phase 3 trial, when and where possible. Given the newness of the endpoint and the new information to be generated in the trial, some information requested may not currently be available or may not be able to be addressed fully until data from the Phase 3 trial is available to address the information requests.

Further studies are dependent on finding a suitable strategic partner.

 Fibrosis. GR-MD-02 is our lead product candidate for treatment of fibrotic disease. Our preclinical data show that GR-MD-02 has a significant therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis as shown in several relevant animal models. In addition, in NASH animal models, GR-MD-02 has been shown to reduce liver fat, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration or death of liver cells. Therefore, we chose GR-MD-02 as the lead candidate in a development program targeted initially at fibrotic liver disease associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, or fatty liver disease). In January 2013, an Investigational New Drug (IND) was submitted to the FDA with the goal of initiating a Phase 1 study in patients with NASH and advanced liver fibrosis to evaluate the human safety of GR-MD-02 and pharmacodynamics biomarkers of disease. On March 1, 2013, the FDA indicated we could proceed with a US Phase 1 clinical trial for GR-MD-02 with a development program aimed at obtaining support for a proposed indication of GR-MD-02 for treatment of NASH with advanced fibrosis. The Phase 1 trial was completed and demonstrated that GR-MD-02 up to 8 mg/kg, i.v. was safe and well tolerated. The human pharmacokinetic data defined a drug dose for use in the planned Phase 2 trials based on extrapolation from efficacy data in NASH animal models of liver fibrosis and/or cirrhosis. Additionally, there was evidence of a pharmacodynamic effect of GR-MD-02 at the 8 mg/kg dose with a decrease in alpha 2 macroglobulin, a serum marker of fibrotic activity, and a reduction in liver stiffness as determined by FibroScan®. An End of Phase 1 Meeting was held with FDA which, amongst other items, provided guidance on the primary endpoint for the Phase 2 clinical trial, the NASH-CX trial. 
 Additionally, an open label drug-drug interaction study was completed in healthy volunteers during the second quarter of 2015 with GR-MD-02 and it showed that with 8 mg/kg dose of GR-MD-02 and 2 mg/kg dose of midazolam there was no drug-drug interaction and no serious adverse events or drug-related adverse events were observed. This study was required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the primary objective was to determine if single or multiple intravenous (IV) doses of GR-MD-02 affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam. The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of GR-MD-02 when administered concomitantly with midazolam. The lack of a drug interaction in this study enabled the Company to expand the number of patients eligible for its Phase 2 clinical trial. In addition, should GR-MD-02 be approved for marketing, the success of this study supports a broader patient population for the drug label. 
 Our Phase 2 program in fibrotic disease consisted of two separate human clinical trials. The primary clinical trial was the Phase 2b NASH-CX study for one year for patients with NASH with well compensated cirrhosis, which began enrolling in June, 2015. This study was the primary focus of our program and is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 2b trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GR-MD-02 for treatment of liver fibrosis and resultant portal hypertension in NASH patients with well compensated

  cirrhosis. A smaller, exploratory NASH-FX trial was conducted to explore potential use of various non-invasive imaging techniques in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis. 
 NASH-FX Trial: The NASH-FX trial, a Phase 2a pilot trial NASH-FX for patients with NASH advanced fibrosis that explored use of three non-invasive imaging technologies, is now complete. It was a short, single site, four-month trial in 30 NASH patients with advanced fibrosis, but not cirrhosis, randomized 1:1 to either 9 bi-weekly doses of 8 mg/kg of GR-MD-02 or placebo. The trial did not meet its primary biomarker endpoint as measured using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (LiverMultiScan(R), Perspectum Diagnostics). The trial also did not meet secondary endpoints that measure liver stiffness as a surrogate for fibrosis using, magnetic resonance-elastography and FibroScan® score. We, and many experts in the field, now believe that a four-month treatment period may not be sufficient to show efficacy results in established liver fibrosis. This small study was not powered for the secondary endpoints and thus, not surprisingly, did not meet the secondary endpoints. In the trial, GR-MD-02 was found to be safe and well tolerated among the patient population with no serious adverse events. Although there was no apparent improvement in the three non-invasive tests for assessment of liver fibrosis in the four-month NASH-FX trial, the principal investigator of the NASH-FX trial has stated that the inhibition of galectin-3 with GR-MD-02 remains promising for the treatment of NASH fibrosis. Of note is that GR-MD-02 has demonstrated an improved clinical effect in moderate-to-severe psoriasis, suggesting the compound has activity in humans in an immune-mediated inflammatory human disease that can occur in association with NASH. We believe our drug candidate provides a promising new approach for the therapy of fibrotic diseases, and liver fibrosis in particular. Fibrosis is the formation of excess connective tissue (collagen and other proteins plus cellular elements such as myofibroblasts) in response to damage, inflammation or repair. When the fibrotic tissue becomes confluent, it obliterates the cellular architecture, leading to scarring and dysfunction of the underlying organ. Given galectin-3s broad biological functionality, it has been demonstrated to be involved in cancer, inflammation and fibrosis, heart disease, and renal disease. We have further demonstrated the broad applicability of the actions of our galectin-3 inhibitors biological effect in ameliorating fibrosis involving lung, kidney, blood vessels, and cardiac tissues in a wide variety of animal models. 
 NASH-CX Trial: The NASH-CX trial was a larger well-designed multi-center clinical trial that explored use of GR-MD-02 for the treatment of liver fibrosis and resultant portal hypertension in patients with well-compensated NASH cirrhosis. Enrollment in this trial was completed in September 2016, and a total of 162 patients at 36 sites in the United States were randomized to receive either 2 mg/kg of GR-MD-02, 8 mg/kg of GR-MD-02 or placebo, with approximately 54 patients in each group. The primary endpoint was a reduction in change in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). Patients received an infusion every other week for one year, total of 26 infusions, and were evaluated to determine the change in HVPG as compared with placebo. HVPG was also correlated with secondary endpoints of fibrosis on liver biopsy as well as with measurement of liver stiffness (FibroScan(R)) and assessment of liver metabolism (13C-methacetin breath test, Exalenz), which are non-invasive measures of the liver that may be used in future studies. Top line data readout was reported in December 2017 demonstrating positive efficacy data and safety and clinically meaningful results in the NASH patients with well compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices (stage 1 cirrhosis). 
 In the total patient population, the primary endpoint HVPG showed a trend toward benefit with GR-MD-02 treatment, but the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. The mean change in HVPG of placebo from baseline to week 54 was 0.3 mm Hg. The mean change in HVPG from baseline was -0.37 and -0.42 for the 2 mg/kg dose and 8 mg/kg dose of GR-MD-02, respectively. 
 Further analysis showed that the drug effect was significantly dependent on dose varices in the total group of patients (p<0.02). In those NASH cirrhosis patients without varices at baseline (about 50% of the total population), there was a statistically significant effect of the 2 mg/kg dose of GR-MD-02 on the absolute change in HVPG (-1.08 mm Hg, p<0.01). The effect of the 8 mg/Kg dose of GR-MD-02 on absolute or percent change in HVPG from baseline to week 54 was not significant. The population of patients without varices at baseline were further subdivided into those with mild portal hypertension (HVPG greater or equal to 6 mm Hg and less than 10 mm Hg). In patients with mild portal hypertension (MPH), both doses of GR-MD-02 demonstrated a statistically significant effect on change in HVPG. The mean change in HVPG in the MPH group were +1.8 mm 
 
5 


  Hg for placebo and -0.3 and -0.4 mm Hg in the 2 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. In patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (HVPG greater than 10 Mm Hg) with no varices at baseline, there was a statistically significant effect of 2 mg/kg of GR-MD-02 on the change in HVPG. 
 A responder analysis was performed on those patients without varices at baseline. Analysis was performed looking at two groups: those with an equal to or greater than 2 mm Hg decrease in HVPG from baseline or those with an equal to or greater than 2 mm Hg and a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in HVPG from baseline. In both cases, the change observed in the GR-MD-02 2 mg/kg group was statistically significant (p<0.01) while that of the 8 mg/kg group was not. 
 In terms of cirrhosis complications over the 54-week treatment period, in patients without varices there were statistically significantly fewer new varices that developed in the treatment groups vs placebo. We believe this may represent a useful measure of clinical outcome. 
 The major conclusions, to date from the NASH-CX trial results are that: i) GR-MD-02 had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect in improving HVPG vs placebo in patients with NASH cirrhosis who did not have esophageal varices at baseline. This effect was seen regardless of the patients baseline portal hypertension. Furthermore, we believe that patients with esophageal varices may have masked benefits in the total patient population. ii) There was an important drug effect of GR-MD-02 in the total patient population on liver biopsy with a statistically significant improvement in hepatocyte ballooning (ie cell death), (iii) There was a statistically significant reduction (p=0.02) in the development of new esophageal varices in drug-treated patients compared to placebo. We believe that this is a clinically relevant endpoint related to patient outcomes, (iv) While there was a drug effect in both the 2 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg dosage groups on liver biopsy and in the mild portal hypertension group, there was a consistently greater and statistically significant effect of the 2 mg/kg dose of GR-MD-02, (v) GR-MD-02 appears to be safe and well tolerated in this one year clinical trial and (vi) We believe this is the first large, randomized clinical trial of any drug to demonstrate a clinically meaningful improvement in portal hypertension or liver biopsy in patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis without esophageal varices. 
 Further information and details on the NASH-CX results summarized above is available in public presentations posted to our website and filed with the SEC. 
 NASH-RX Trial: The NASH-RX Trial is a phase 3 trial of GR-MD-02 in NASH cirrhosis patients. We have met with the FDA to discuss the results of the NASH-CX trial in an End of Phase 2 meeting as disclosed in our May 14, 2018 press release. The proposed target population of the Phase 3 clinical trial will be patients with well compensated established NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patients will be selected based on criteria commonly used in clinical practice to identify patients with portal hypertension who are at risk of developing esophageal varices. Ongoing conversations with FDA included a recent Type C Meeting via teleconference with the Agency on February 6, 2019, to discuss Galectins proposal for use of progression to varices as the primary surrogate endpoint moving forward. 
 In the meeting, FDA confirmed that the Agency is supportive of the use of progression to varices as a potential surrogate endpoint and progression to large varices as a component of a composite clinical benefit endpoint pending additional requested information. Galectin will address and implement additional FDA requests and considerations for the Phase 3 trial, when and where possible. Given the newness of the endpoint and the new information to be generated in the trial, some information requested may not currently be available or may not be able to be addressed fully until data from the Phase 3 trial is available to address the information requests. 
 The focus and goal of the therapeutic program is to stop the progression of and reverse the fibrosis and/or portal hypertension in the liver and, thereby improve liver function and prevent the development of complications of fibrosis/cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in patients. The results of the NASH-CX trial substantiate that, subject to confirmation in later stage clinical trials, we believe that this goal is achievable in a significant portion of the NASH cirrhosis patient population i.e. those NASH cirrhosis patients with portal

  hypertension at risk of developing esophageal varices that may bleed and experience other decompensating events. The trial design has been refined with external consultants and sent out to potential CROs in a confidential Request for Proposal (RFP) process. We are in the process of evaluating and interviewing the CRO candidates. The final primary endpoint and the Phase 3 clinical trial design, including projected timing and costs will be announced once the planning phase is completed. 
 Cancer Immunotherapy. We believe there is potential for galectin inhibition to play a key role in the burgeoning area of cancer immunotherapy. For example, there have been several recent approvals of drugs that enhance a patients immune system to fight cancer. It is our goal to use a galectin inhibitor to further enhance the immune system function to fight cancer in a way that complements other approaches to this type of therapy. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that galectin-3 is expressed at high levels in multiple types of tumors, adds to the malignant nature of the tumors, and protects the tumors from immune system attack. Our drug candidates provide a promising new therapeutic approach to enhance the activity of the immune system against cancer cells. Preclinical studies have indicated that GR-MD-02 enhances the immune response to cancer cells, increased tumor shrinkage and enhanced survival in immune competent mice with prostate, breast, melanoma and sarcoma cancers when combined with one of the immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1, or with the immune cell activator anti-OX40. These preclinical data led to the filing of two Investigator-sponsored INDs and the initiation of studies of GR-MD-02 in combination with Yervoy® (ipilimumab) and KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Phase 1B studies of patients with metastatic melanoma. The KEYTRUDA trial has also been expanded to include patients with non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These studies are being conducted under the sponsorship of Providence Portland Medical Centers Earle A. Chiles Research Institute (EACRI). 
 Data on this combination immunotherapy program was presented on February 7, 2017 at the 9th GTCBio Immunotherapeutics & Immunomonitoring Conference in San Diego, CA by Dr. William L. Redmond, Providence Cancer Center. Preclinical results in mouse models of multiple types of cancers showed important anti-tumor activity and increased survival effects of combining GR-MD-02 with different types of immune modulators, providing a case for progressing studies into human patients with cancer. Seven patients were treated in the GR-MD-02 in combination with Yervoy trial, with no safety concerns in these low dose cohorts. Due to changes in the standard of care for metastatic melanoma (i.e., approval of anti-PD-1), recruitment has been slowed significantly in this trial. Promising results were reported in the Phase 1b trial combining GR-MD-02 with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA). Cohort 1 was completed (n=6, 5 with melanoma, one head and neck) with one partial response and one mixed response in 5 melanoma patients. There was a rapid and marked tumor response after 3 doses of combined GR-MD-02 and pembrolizumab in the one partial response patient who had failed high-dose IL-2 and oncolytic virus + ipilimumab. The study is ongoing and progression to further development will be based on response rate as compared to historical response rates to pembrolizumab alone. In September 2018 we announced additional preliminary clinical data from cohort 3 of this investigator-initiated trial. When aggregated with cohorts previously reported, the data shows a 50% objective response rate in advanced melanoma with GR-MD-02 in combination with KEYTRUDA, and a significant decrease in the frequency of suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells following treatment in the responding patients (on day 85 post-treatment). Fourteen advanced melanoma patients across three dose cohorts now have Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) data. Six patients completed in cohort 3 (8 mg/Kg) have now been added to the three patients completed in cohort 2 (4 mg/Kg) and five patients completed in cohort 1 (2 mg/Kg). Cohorts 1 and 3 each had two patients with an objective response. All three patients in cohort 2 had an objective response. In addition to the fourteen advanced melanoma patients, six patients with head and neck cancer were enrolled in this trial with a 33% ORR and 67% DCR. These data, taken together with the observed favorable safety and tolerability of the combination, in the view of the principal investigator, provide compelling rationale to move forward. Given that all three melanoma patients were responders at the 4 mg/Kg dose, the investigators plan to continue the trial with the expansion of the 4 mg/Kg cohort to include additional advanced melanoma patients and additional head and neck cancer patients.

 Severe skin diseases. During our Phase 1 NASH fibrosis trial with GR-MD-02, a clinical effect on plaque psoriasis was observed in a NASH patient who also had this disease. This patient had marked improvement in her psoriasis, with improvement beginning after the third infusion. She reported that her psoriasis was completely gone and her skin was normal after the fourth infusion. Her skin remained normal for 17 months after the final infusion of study drug. The patient is convinced that the improvement in her psoriasis is related to the study drug. 
 This serendipitous finding, combined with galectin-3 protein being markedly upregulated in the capillary epithelia (small blood vessels) of the psoriatic dermis (plaque lesions), led to a phase 2a trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. GR-MD-02 inhibition of galectin-3 may attenuate capillary changes in the psoriatic dermis and inflammatory recruitment, perhaps explaining the improvements observed in the NASH fibrosis trial patient. In this open-label, unblinded trial (no placebo, all patients knowingly receive active drug), 5 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were administered GR-MD-02 every two weeks for 24 weeks. In May 2016, we reported positive results on the first four patients after 12 weeks of therapy. Based on these results, we modified the trial to include 24 weeks of therapy. In August 2016, we reported on four patients after 24 weeks of therapy and one patient after 12 weeks of therapy. The four patients who received 24 weeks of therapy experienced an average of 48% improvement in their plaque psoriasis. At this time, the average response in all five patients remains at 50% with one patient having an 82% improvement. However, there are existing drugs on the market in this disease that produce 75% and higher improvements in 60-90% of patients. While we are encouraged that this study has demonstrated clinically meaningful results in a human disease with GR-MD-02, the next steps would entail a controlled, does-ranging clinical trial which we do not expect to conduct absent a strategic partnership. 
 We believe the mechanism of action for GR-MD-02 is based upon interaction with, and inhibition of, galectin proteins, particularly galectin-3, which are expressed at high levels in certain pathological states including inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. While GR-MD-02 is capable of binding to multiple galectin proteins, we believe that it has the greatest affinity for galectin-3, the most prominent galectin implicated in pathological processes. Blocking galectin in cancer and liver fibrosis has specific salutary effects on the disease process, as discussed below. 
 Liver Fibrosis: New Approach for a Significant Unmet Medical Need 
 When an internal organ is exposed to chronic disease one of the responses is that scar tissue is laid down in the organ (this process is called fibrosis). The longer the disease affects the organ, the more fibrous tissue is deposited, and this ultimately results in the failure of the organ. This chronic fibrosis of organs may occur in the liver, lung, kidney, and heart, as well as others and, as a result, fibrosis of organs has been estimated to account for as much as 45% of all mortality in the United States. Scientific findings during the last few years indicate that the galectin-3 protein is critically important in this fibrotic process in multiple organs. 
 In the liver, fibrosis is the end result of multiple inflammatory conditions and infections. Progressive liver fibrosis leads to cirrhosis, which results in reduction of liver function, multiple medical complications and ultimately death. It is estimated that one to two million patients have cirrhosis in the United States with close to 50,000 losing their lives yearly. Only a fraction of patients lives, approximately 6,200 per year, are saved by liver transplantation at a cost of at least $350,000 per transplantation with significant additional costs of care and medications after the transplant. One condition in particular that frequently leads to cirrhosis is non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a liver disease characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver with associated inflammation and fibrosis, which can lead to end-stage cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 9 to 15 million Americans are affected by NASH, and other sources suggest it may be as many as 30 million people have NASH, and forecasts that the number of Americans affected by this disease is growing due to obesity and diabetes, with the potential to become the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and liver transplantation in the future. Liver transplantation is currently the only therapeutic approach to NASH or other forms of liver fibrosis because, to the best of our knowledge, there are no drug therapies on the market. Organ transplantation is a difficult, risky and costly procedure, and organ availability is scarce. There is also the 
 
8 


  risk of developing cirrhosis in the transplanted liver from the same disease that damaged the patients original liver. Therefore, there is a great need for other therapeutic options. All diseases that affect the liver (viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and fatty liver as examples) lead to the development of scarring of the liver. 
 The primary focus of the Company is to use galectin inhibitors to block galectin-3 and treat organ scarring or fibrosis in the liver. There are no approved therapies for treatment of liver fibrosis. We believe that our drug candidates have the potential to treat NASH and other forms of liver fibrosis. Scientific evidence suggests that galectin-3 is essential for the development of liver fibrosis in animals. Published data show that mice lacking the galectin-3 gene, and thus unable to produce galectin-3, are essentially incapable of developing liver fibrosis in response to toxic insult to the liver and in fatty liver disease. Moreover, mice that do not have the galectin-3 gene are resistant to lung and kidney fibrosis. These published data show that galectin-3 is a critical protein for the development of organ fibrosis. Our drugs, based on experiments in well characterized animal models, are also potentially useful in scarring or fibrosis of other organs such as lung and kidney which expands the possibilities for future therapeutic indications. 
 We have evaluated the ability of GR-MD-02 to block galectin-3 in animal models of liver fibrosis, the conclusions of which yielded positive results. Our pre-clinical data show that GR-MD-02 may have a therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis as shown in several relevant animal models. Therefore, we chose GR-MD-02 as the lead candidate in a development program targeted initially at fibrotic liver disease associated with NASH. 
 We evaluated GR-MD-02 in pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacology studies during 2013, and filed an IND with the FDA in January 2013, for initiating human studies in patients with NASH. In February 2013, we entered into an agreement with CTI Clinical Trial Services to assist with the design, development and conduct of one or more clinical research studies, specifically for services with respect to our Phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate safety of GR-MD-02 in patients with NASH. The FDA notified us in March 2013 that we may proceed with a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with NASH, and we began enrolling patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2013. In August 2013, GR-MD-02 was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for NASH with hepatic fibrosis, commonly known as fatty liver disease with advanced fibrosis. In January 2014, we completed the enrollment of the first cohort of patients in the Phase 1 trial with no serious adverse events being reported. We reported initial safety and tolerability results from the first cohort of patients on June 30, 2014. The second cohort of this Phase 1 trial began, and enrollment was completed in April 2014. In July 2014, we reported the results from the second cohort of patients. Enrollment of the third cohort of Phase 1 began in July 2014, with interim results presented in November 2014 with the final report on cohort 3 presented in January 2015. The results of the Phase 1 study demonstrate that (i) GR-MD-02 was safe and well tolerated by patients with advanced NASH liver fibrosis after IV administration of four doses of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 8mg/kg lean body weight, (ii) Pharmacokinetics in patients with advanced fibrosis, but not cirrhosis, revealed drug exposure in humans at the 8 mg/kg dose that was equivalent to the upper range of the targeted therapeutic dose determined from effective doses in NASH animal models, (iii) Disease Serum Marker Effect showed there was a statistically significant, dose-dependent reduction in FibroTest® scores due to a statistically significant reduction in alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) serum levels, and (iv) Liver Stiffness Effect, as measured by FibroScan® showed that there was a signal of reduced liver stiffness in patients receiving GR-MD-02. The reduction seen in A2M does not necessarily mean fibrosis got better in this short study but does suggest changes in the fibrogenic process that might lead to an improvement in fibrosis with longer-term therapy. These Phase 1 results in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis, in addition to completion of further toxicology and drug-drug interaction studies provided a firm foundation for entry into a Phase 2 development program (described above). Top line results of our Phase 2b in compensated NASH cirrhosis patients was reported in December 2017 and is more fully described above as well in our SEC filings. 
 GR-MD-02 is a proprietary, patented galactoarabino-rhamnogalacturonan polysaccharide polymer that is comprised predominantly of galacturonic acid, galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, and smaller amounts of other sugars. Structural studies have shown that GR-MD-02 binds to galectin-1 and to galectin-3 with binding affinity to galectin-3 being significantly greater than binding to galectin-1. With respect to GR-MD-02, we currently

  have, as of December 31, 2018, 20 granted U.S. patents, and 57 foreign granted patents. These patents more fully described below, include a composition of matter patent, and methods of use including manufacture, use patient in patients with NASH, in patients with liver fibrosis, and in patients with diabetic kidney disease. Additional patent applications are pending with respect to, amongst other uses, cancer immunotherapy, lung fibrotic disease, and inflammatory disease associated with increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase. Patents have also been granted with respect to liver fibrosis, NASH, and liver fibrosis in combination with other therapeutic agents. Compounds for subcutaneous administration and oral delivery are currently under pre-clinical development. 
 Galectin Inhibition in Cancer Therapy 
 We believe the potential exists for galectin inhibition to play an important role in cancer therapy. Galectin proteins, particularly galectin-1 and galectin-3, have been shown to be highly expressed in the majority of cancers and have multiple roles in promoting cancer progression, including tumor cell invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor evasion of the immune system. 
 The role of galectins in cancer immunotherapy can be understood through the Galectin Effect, a recent discovery of how tumors avoid the bodys own immune system, i.e., the tumors secrete galectin proteins that block the bodys efforts to fight tumors. Our current program to block the Galectin Effect is based on the research of Dr. Pierre van der Bruggen (of the Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research in Brussels, Belgium), demonstrating that galectin-3, which is produced by the vast majority of human cancers, binds to and blocks the actions of tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes, the major immune cell in the bodys defense against cancers. In addition, Dr. William L. Redmond of Providence Portland Medical Centers Earl A. Chiles Research Institute (EACRI) has shown that our galectin inhibitors can enhance the anti-tumor immunogenic effect of other immunotherapies based on targeting lymphocyte checkpoints such as CTLA4. Based on these results, we believe that the bodys immune cells may be unable to attack and kill tumor cells in the presence of galectins. Using this approach, the mechanism of action for our drugs seeks to block galectins and, in turn, restore the ability of the T-lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. 
 The preclinical study found that GR-MD-02 increased tumor shrinkage and enhanced survival in immune competent mice with prostate or breast cancers when combined with one of the immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1. These findings suggest a role for GR-MD-02 in cancer immunotherapy. These preclinical observations by Dr Redmond provided scientific rationale for proceeding and lead to the filing by Providence Portland Medical Center of an Investigator-sponsored IND to conduct a Phase 1B study to determine if GR-MD-02 enhances the probability of melanoma response with ipilimumab by inducing proliferation, activation and memory function of CD8+ T cells in human patients. The company has licensed the underlying invention from Providence Portland Medical Center. This study represents a novel approach for patients with metastatic melanoma. The IND was approved by FDA in February 2014. This study is being conducted under the sponsorship of Providence Portland Medical Centers Earle A. Chiles Research Institute (EACRI) and is being supported by the Company. 
 The study employs a dose escalation of GR-MD-02 in conjunction with the standard therapeutic dose of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma for whom ipilimumab would be considered standard of care. In addition to monitoring for toxicity and clinical response by irRECIST criteria on imaging tests, blood samples will be obtained to assess immunologic measures relevant to galectin biology and ipilimumab T-cell check-point inhibition. Galectin Therapeutics is providing its proprietary compound GR-MD-02 to EACRI researchers, as well as supplying researchers with supporting analysis of the pharmacokinetics of GR-MD-02 and the right to reference the Companys open IND on GR-MD-02. To date the first two dosing groups have been completed without serious adverse events that were determined to be related to GR-MD-02. The third dosing group is no longer enrolling due to the availability of newer agents such as the anti-PD! agents. 
 Similar to the agreement set forth for the ipilimumab (Yervoy®) Phase 1B study, Providence Portland Medical Center submitted an IND in September 2015 to conduct a Phase 1B study of GR-MD-02 and 
 
10 


  pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) in patients with metastatic melanoma. The combination of GR-MD-02 and an anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab) has been shown to enhance T-cell activation, memory, and effector function, and promote better antitumor responses in multiple mouse studies. The study will test the hypothesis that galectin-3 antagonism using GR-MD-02 with enhance the probability of melanoma response using pembrolizumab in patients by inducing proliferation, activation and memory function of CD8+ T cells that recognize melanoma antigens. Similar to the ipilimumab study, the study employs a dose escalation of GR-MD-02 in conjunction with the standard therapeutic dose of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma who have had progression of their melanoma after ipilimumab and/or BRAF targeted therapy when a BRAF mutation is present. In addition to monitoring for toxicity and clinical response, blood and tumor samples will be obtained to assess immunologic measures relevant to galectin biology and pembrolizumab T-cell checkpoint inhibition. Top line results of the combination of the 3 dosing cohorts was reported in September 2018 and is more fully described above as well in our SEC filings and press releases. These data, taken together with the observed favorable safety and tolerability of the combination, in the view of the principal investigator, provide compelling rationale to move forward. Given that all three melanoma patients were responders at the 4 mg/Kg dose, the investigators plan to continue the trial with the expansion of the 4 mg/Kg cohort to include additional advanced melanoma patients and additional head and neck cancer patients. If these additional results should continue to be encouraging, the next step in development would entail a controlled randomized Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 Our development and commercial viability, and ultimately our competitiveness, depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contract restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees, consultants, and any third parties with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and by restricting access to that information.

 Research 
 Our primary focus is on the design and testing of agents that target galectins in various in vitro and in vivo systems and that demonstrate efficacy in treatment of experimentally induced fibrosis or enhance immune system responsiveness in various tissues and in live animal models. We contract with independent laboratories and other facilities to conduct our research, which is designed, evaluated and managed by our scientists. While we conduct in house research related to our compounds at SBH laboratories in Massachusetts, we do not anticipate building additional in-house research or development facilities or hiring staff other than for purposes of designing and managing our out-sourced research. 
 As we develop products eligible for clinical trials, we contract with independent parties to assist in the design of the clinical trial protocols, arrange for and monitor the clinical trials, collect data and analyze data. In addition, certain clinical trials for our products may be conducted by government-sponsored agencies and will be dependent on governmental participation and funding. Our dependence on independent parties and clinical sites involves risks including reduced control over the timing and other aspects of our clinical trials. 
 In February 2013, the Company established a collaborative drug discovery program with Dr. Geert-Jan Boons (Dr. Boons) laboratory located in the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center at the University of Georgia. This on-going program is focused on the discovery of new carbohydrate molecules that can be used in the therapy of diseases where galectin proteins play a major role, including cancer, and inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. The aim of this program is to develop a pipeline of drugs that can target galectins. This is an important goal as follow-on compounds for our drugs currently in development and to extend the potential indications and routes of administration. The Complex Carbohydrate Research Center is a world-class program, and Dr. Boons is a world renowned and pre-eminent carbohydrate chemist. 
 In September 2014, the Company established a collaborative research program with Dr. William Redmonds laboratory located at the Providence Portland Medical Center, Portland, Oregon. This program focuses on combination immunotherapy plus galectin inhibition to augment tumor immunogenicity. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our expenditures for research and development were $6.5 million and $11.7 million, respectively. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred. 
 In January 2014 we created, with SBH Sciences, Inc. (Natick, Ma), Galectin Sciences, LLC, a collaborative joint venture to research and develop small organic molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 for oral administration. 
 Using computer molecular modeling techniques coupled with in vitro screening of a variety of compound libraries, SBH Sciences had identified several small organic molecules with promising galectin-3 inhibitory activity in vitro. Galectin Sciences LLC will further develop these unique organic molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 as drug candidates as well as develop additional candidates. Subject to availability of funding, Galectin Sciences LLC will build on the scientific body of knowledge amassed by SBH Sciences, coupled with Galectin Therapeutics knowledge and expertise of galectins pathological role and mechanism of action in inflammation, fibrosis and many cancers. The long-term goal of this effort is to identify and develop drug candidates that are highly specific galectin inhibitors which may be formulated for oral administration. The intermediate term goal is the development of small molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 which exhibit activity in in vivo preclinical disease models of fibrosis and cancer in which galectins play a key role. Several patent applications have been filed to protect the various series of compounds discovered by these efforts. 
 Because, increased levels of galectin proteins have been implicated in a very large number of inflammatory, fibrotic and neoplastic diseases; the discovery and development of orally active galectin inhibitors would be a major step towards expanded treatment approaches for these disorders. This early drug discovery effort may lead to drugs that would expand our pipeline as follow on compounds to our first in class galectin inhibitors, GR-MD-02 and GM-CT-01. These efforts have identified several potential compounds which are continuing to be explored to identify lead molecules that may be identified for clinical development.

 Manufacturing and Marketing 
 We are a development stage Company at this time and do not intend to establish internal facilities for the manufacture of our products for clinical or commercial production. To have our products manufactured, we have developed and will continue to develop relationships with third-parties that have established pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and expertise. We are not a party to any long-term agreement with any of our suppliers and, accordingly, we have our products manufactured on a purchase-order basis from one of two primary well-known and established pharmaceutical suppliers that meeting FDA requirements. 
 Because our products are in the development stage, we have not created a sales and marketing staff to commercialize pharmaceutical products. If we develop products eligible for commercial sale, we will need to develop a sales and marketing capability or rely on third parties such as licensees, collaborators, joint venture partners or independent distributors to market and sell those products. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers, analytical testing and other laboratories and marketers will involve risks relating to our reduced control, and other risks including those discussed in Risk Factors  Risks Related to our Company  There are risks associated with reliance on third parties for manufacturing, marketing, sales, managed care and distribution infrastructure channels. 
 Competition 
 Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new technologies for the treatment of cancer, fibrotic diseases and other diseases. Technologies such as monoclonal antibodies could be competitive with our galectin therapeutic platforms. Other companies are trying to improve the therapeutic profile of widely used protein-based drugs. While these companies may broaden the market for our products they may also provide competitive alternatives to our products. We expect increased competition in the area of galectins will be fueled by a nearly exponential increase in the publication rate of research papers on galectins. 
 See Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Company  We face intense competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries for additional discussion related to our current and potential competition. 
 Government Regulation 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution. 
Drug Approval Process 
 Drugs may not be marketed in the U.S. until the FDA has approved them. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. include: 

1. | Pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies,
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin,
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication,
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Submission to the FDA of a NDA,
---+--------------------------------

 
14 


 
5. | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing procedures (cGMP) established by the FDA,
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | FDA review and approval of the NDA, and
---+----------------------------------------


7. | FDA review and approval of a trademark used in connection with a pharmaceutical.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as numerous in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and the Company must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There is no certainty that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and constant oversight by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), before it can begin. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into patients to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacodynamics, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population. There is no assurance that these trials will be completed within a specified period of time, if at all. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA will generally issue an approval letter. If the FDA evaluates the NDA submission or the manufacturing facilities as not acceptable, the FDA will generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Even if an applicant submits the requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and there is no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 See Risk Factors  Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Products  We will need regulatory approvals to commercialize our products for additional discussion of regulatory risks related to our drug development program. 
 FDA Priority Review 
 FDA procedures provide for priority review of an NDA submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, offer a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease. NDAs 
 
15 


  that are granted priority review are acted upon more quickly than NDAs given standard review. If we were to seek priority review, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will grant priority review status, that priority review status will affect the time of review, or that the FDA will approve the NDA submitted for any of our product candidates, whether or not priority review status is granted. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 If FDA approval of one or more of our products is obtained, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
 Regulation Outside the United States 
 Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. No assurance can be given that even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices will be approved for such product. 
Environmental Regulation 
 Pharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies must comply with laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. We do not anticipate building in-house research, development or manufacturing facilities, and, accordingly, do not expect to have to comply directly with environmental regulation. However, our contractors and others conducting research, development or manufacturing activities for us may be required to incur significant compliance cost, and this could in turn could increase our expense or delay our completion of research or manufacturing programs. 
Employees 
 We currently have six full-time employees, four of whom are involved primarily in management of our pre-clinical research and development and clinical trials and three who were involved primarily in management and administration of our Company. We also utilize contractors and consultants who provide product development, manufacture, analytical testing, clinical trial expertise, and clinical trial support.
