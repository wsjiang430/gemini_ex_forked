 Background 
 The synthetic biology market is growing rapidly and is being fueled by increased access to affordable and innovative tools that enable new applications. We believe this is analogous to the trends seen in the next generation sequencing, or NGS, market, where declining costs of sequencing drove adoption, new applications and market expansion. Similarly, tools that combine advanced production technology with modern digital technology and software capabilities, such as our DNA synthesis platform, are driving growth and market creation for synthetic DNA and synthetic DNA-based products. According to BCC Research, in calendar year 2017, the market for synthetic biology products was approximately $4.4 billion and is expected to grow to $13.9 billion by calendar year 2022. We believe this period of accelerated growth in the synthetic biology industry is in its early stages. 
 The applications of our DNA synthesis platform are broad. We currently generate revenue through two primary product lines: synthetic biology tools and next generation sequencing tools. In addition, we are leveraging the versatility of our platform to expand our portfolio to include other synthetic DNA-based products and address additional market opportunities, including vertical market opportunities in biological drug discovery and development and digital data storage. 
 In April 2016, we launched the first applications of our platform, synthetic genes and high diversity collections of oligonucleotides, or oligo pools, to disrupt the gene synthesis market and make legacy DNA synthesis methods obsolete. We believe that the traditional DNA synthesis methods used by our competitors are inherently limited in scalability and are not optimized to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for high-quality, low-cost synthetic DNA. Our silicon-based chip technology can increase DNA production by a factor of 9,600 on a footprint like that of traditional DNA synthesis methods. Also, it significantly lowers the volume of required reagents, specifically the most expensive reagent by a factor of 1,000,000, and improves the precision of the synthesis process relative to legacy methods. This enables us to produce high-quality synthetic DNA on a much larger scale and at lower cost than competitors. Importantly, it is this platform that can be applied to multiple market opportunities to harness the power of DNAfrom next generation sequencing to drug discovery to data storageto enable life-changing products and therapeutic medicines. 
 In February 2018, we launched an innovative and comprehensive sample preparation kit for next generation sequencing. Our kit leverages our platform to precisely synthesize short pieces of DNA called probes, and thus uniformly amplify the desired target DNA segments, considerably improving the accuracy of the downstream sequencing analysis, saving both time and sequencing costs. We have expanded our NGS offering to include both general and customized tools in addition to adding the mouse exome. In addition, we have formatted our NGS tools to work within an automated and advanced workflow. 
 Our currently marketed products target the synthetic DNA market, a sub-segment of the synthetic biology market, and NGS sample preparation, a large adjacent market opportunity. We estimate that the combined market opportunity was $1.8 billion in calendar year 2016. Based on market research, we believe that current estimates understate our market potential because they reflect the costly, time-consuming, and cumbersome nature of legacy DNA synthesis technologies. We believe our solution has the potential to materially expand our initial market by providing end users access to high-quality and lower cost tools, encouraging adoption and facilitating new applications for our products. 
 As part of our synthetic biology offering, we have commercialized a custom DNA library solution which we believe can be leveraged to facilitate other proprietary tools to provide an end-to-end solution in biologics drug discovery and early development, from target to investigational new drug, or IND, application, adding value as a partner to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 
 In fiscal year 2019 we served 1,305 customers and reported $54.4 million in revenue including $21.9 million to the industrial chemicals sector, $17.4 million to the healthcare sector, $13.8 million to the academic research 
 
3 


  sector and $1.2 million to the agricultural sector. The industrial chemicals segment includes sales of $9.2 million to Ginkgo Bioworks (which we believe is the largest purchaser of synthetic DNA). 
 We generated revenues of $54.4 million in fiscal 2019, $25.4 million in fiscal 2018 and $10.8 million in fiscal 2017, while incurring net losses of $107.7 million, $71.2 million and $59.3 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the success of our existing products and development and commercialization of additional products in the synthetic biology industry. 
 Our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in South San Francisco, California. As of September 30, 2019, we had 414 full-time employees worldwide, including three locations in the San Francisco Bay Area and an international location in Tel Aviv, Israel. We also utilize a team of 32 dedicated commercial consultants across the European Union and the United Kingdom and 18 dedicated commercial consultants across Asia. In May 2018, we received private funding to establish production facilities and commercial operations in China for the manufacture of the back end of our NGS product line. We expect to establish back-end production facilities to expand our commercial market for our Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) product line in China. We expect this site will be open by the end of December 2019. This site will be used to ensure Asian customers receive products in a timeframe similar to other parts of the world. Our advanced front-end manufacturing facilities to create our synthetic DNA products will remain in the United States and subject to comprehensive patent protection in key jurisdictions. Twist will continue to use our best practice biosecurity screening program in servicing the China market, a part of the world that is dominated by foreign actors that we do not believe have rigorous biosecurity screening measures. 
 Through September 30, 2019, we have raised a total of $444.4 million in net proceeds from public and private funding. Specifically, we have raised $290.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock from January 2016 through July 2018, and a total of $153.9 million in net proceeds from the sale of stock, including $84.3 million in net proceeds from our public offering in May 2019 and $69.6 million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in October 2018.

 According to BCC Research, the overall market for synthetic biology products was approximately $4.4 billion in calendar year 2017 and is expected to grow to over $13.9 billion by calendar year 2022. This industry momentum creates a significant opportunity for us to grow within our existing markets as well as expand our product offering. 
 Synthetic DNA is the fundamental building block of synthetic biology. Users of synthetic biology can design synthetic DNA to regulate the production of these proteins and molecules to achieve a specific functional 
 
4 


  purpose. While synthetic DNA has been produced for more than 40 years, the complexities of biology and the production constraints inherent in legacy processes have historically limited the applications and market opportunities for DNA synthesis. 
 Limitations of existing solutions 
 Traditional methods of DNA synthesis consist of a two-step process that initially involves the synthesis of oligonucleotides, also referred to as oligos, which are short strands of DNA. These oligos are then combined to create longer strands of DNA. Currently, there are two primary methodologies used by others to create synthetic DNA, the 96-well plate method and the microarray method, each having production limitations that we believe make these technologies sub-optimal to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for synthetic DNA. In addition, because the synthesis of oligos can introduce errors in the sequence order, all DNA synthesis methods require a process called cloning to produce many identical copies of a strand of DNA, such as a clonal gene. Today, all of our competitors use one of these two primary methods of DNA synthesis and require cloning for clonal genes. 
 96-well plate method of DNA synthesis 
 Introduced as early as the 1950s, a 96-well plate is a flat plastic plate, roughly the size of two smartphones, with eight rows of 12 wells that are used as small test tubes. Instead of creating one sequence of DNA at a time in a single test tube, the 96-well plate allows researchers to create 96 oligos in parallel, one in each well. While this process successfully achieves DNA synthesis, it requires high volumes of phosphoramidites, an expensive raw material, as well as other ancillary reagents. It also produces excessive amounts of the final product, significantly more than is required for most subsequent processes, resulting in material that is discarded and an unnecessary expense. Additionally, this process is not scalable to produce high volumes, as approximately 100 oligos are needed to assemble one gene and therefore only one gene can be made from each 96-well plate. 
 Microarray method of DNA synthesis 
 Unlike a 96-well plate, a microarray is a flat surface made of plastic or glass on which DNA is synthesized directly in an array of discrete locations. Microarrays allow large numbers of oligos to be synthesized in parallel, increasing DNA production by up to four orders of magnitude when compared to the 96-well plate. However, while this method can make 100 genes in parallel, it remains difficult to scale, requires many steps, and results in significant waste of materials. 
 Cloning 
 Cloning is a tedious process to filter out errors and produce many identical copies of a strand of DNA, such as a gene. While the cloning process results in a precise sequence, it is incredibly slow and labor intensive and generally takes around 10 business days to complete. As a result, it is time consuming, expensive, and, in many cases, not an efficient use of researchers time. In general, more accurate DNA synthesis technology results in fewer errors in the sequence order and reduces the time and costs required or allocated to the cloning process. 
 Our platform 
 We developed the Twist Bioscience DNA synthesis platform to address the limitations of throughput, scalability, and cost inherent in legacy DNA synthesis methods. Our platform stems from extensive analyses of, and improvements to, the existing gene synthesis and assembly workflows. Our core technologies combine expertise in silicon, software, fluidics, chemistry, and motion and vision control to miniaturize thousands of parallel chemical reactions on silicon and write thousands of strands of DNA in parallel. With a footprint that is similar to the size of a 96-well plate that produces one gene, we are able to produce 9,600 genes in parallel. Based on current production needs, we have intentionally designed our latest chip to make 6,144 genes in parallel, but we have the current capability to increase this to 9,600 genes, as needed. We have combined our DNA synthesis

  technology with propriety software and a scalable commercial infrastructure to create our vertically integrated DNA synthesis platform capable of delivering very large volumes of high-quality synthetic DNA at low cost. 
 


Next Generation Sequencing Market 
 Our next generation sequencing (NGS) product line improves the work of our customers within large and growing markets. NGS has transformed many markets in recent years by changing the landscape of diagnosing disease and disorders to offer a path to prevention or treatment of disease. Some of the markets impacted by NGS include: oncology, reproductive health, agriculture, consumer genomics, infectious disease research and drug discovery. As NGS technology improved and the cost of sequencing declines, new emerging markets that were once considered impractical, such as population-scale sequencing and single cell sequencing, have become major areas of interest and investment. 
 Historically, a significant constraint in many NGS applications has been the high cost and long turnaround time of oligonucleotide production. Highly accurate and reproducible oligonucleotide production is required to produce high quality target enrichment data. Traditionally, the lack of options for oligonucleotide production forced researchers to choose between using less precise methods or to reduce the number of samples in their study.
 The ability of the Twist DNA synthesis platform to precisely manufacture target enrichment probes at large scale has dramatically increased the types of projects that can now be addressed using NGS technologies. Our platform has unlocked new applications, improved data quality, and dramatically expanded the types of scientific questions that can be answered using NGS. In addition, the speed of our DNA synthesis platform enables customers to quickly deploy NGS technologies to applications where the time to answer is critical. 
 Our products 
 We have developed multiple products derived from synthetic DNA and our versatile DNA synthesis technology. Our current offering consists of two primary product lines that address different needs of our customers across a variety of applications: synthetic genes, oligo pools, next generation sequencing tools and DNA libraries.

 Synthetic Biology Products 
 Synthetic genes 
 Synthetic genes are manufactured strands of DNA. Customers order our synthetic genes to conduct a wide range of research, including product development for the healthcare, agricultural, and industrial chemical industries as well as a multitude of applications within academic research. Virtually all research and development requires trial and error, and our customers require many variations of genes to find the DNA sequence that achieves their objectives. 
 We offer two primary categories of synthetic genes: genes of perfect quality, clonal genes, in a vehicle to carry the DNA, also called a vector, and genes of near-perfect quality, non-clonal genes or fragments, that customers can place in their own vector. Within these two categories, customers can order different lengths of DNA depending on their required final gene construct. Customers can order longer genes or shorter genes and can stitch genes together to create longer or shorter constructs if desired. 
 Clonal genes in a Twist Bioscience or customer vector 
 Our premier gene synthesis offering delivers clonally perfect genes. For our clonally perfect genes, we perform the cloning on behalf of our customers and deliver DNA in either a customer-supplied vector or a Twist Bioscience vector. Customer-supplied vectors greatly simplify downstream work for our customers, allowing them to take our genes and pass them directly into their workflows. We have also developed a catalog of our own specific vectors. Currently, we manufacture genes of up to 5,000 base pairs in length, yielding a clonally perfect piece of DNA that our customers can immediately use for their research. We offer turnaround times of approximately 11  17 business days for clonal genes. Our standard pricing for clonal DNA is $0.09 per base pair for genes between 300 and 1,800 bps in length. 
 Non-clonal genes
Non-clonal genes serve customers who prefer to conduct their own cloning protocols or that do not need, or want, to pay for perfect quality genes. We offer non-clonal genes of up to 1,800 base pairs in length, which we believe addresses the vast majority of demand for non-clonal genes. We offer turnaround times of six to nine business days for non-clonal genes, with what we believe is the lowest industry error rate of 1:3000 base pairs. Our standard pricing for non-clonal genes is $0.07 per base pair. 
 Oligonucleotide (Oligo) pools 
 Oligo pools, or high diversity collections of oligonucleotides, are utilized in many applications, including targeted next generation sequencing, or NGS, CRISPR gene editing, mutagenesis experiments, DNA origami (the nanoscale folding of DNA to create two- and three-dimensional shapes at the nanoscale), DNA computing and data storage in DNA, among others. Our oligo pools are also used for high-throughput reporter assays that are used to study cell signaling pathways, gene regulation, and the structure of cell regulatory elements. For these applications, we provide customers with accurate and uniform synthetic oligos to precisely match their required designs. 
 We sell a diverse, customizable set of oligo pools, ranging from a few hundred oligos to over one million and offer oligonucleotides of up to 300 nucleotides in length with an error rate of 1:2000 nucleotides and turnaround times beginning at five days. In the future, we expect to offer cloned pools, and a sub-pooling capability which will allow our customers to purchase lower complexity pools and arrayed pools. 
 Oligo pools for CRISPR gene editing 
 CRISPR is a recently discovered gene editing tool that has become an area of significant research focus, especially in drug development, and is a rapidly growing application that is contributing to growing demand for 
 
7 


  our oligo pools. In the CRISPR editing process, a short sequence of RNA called guide-RNA (gRNA) binds to its target DNA sequence in a host cell, indicating to an enzyme where to cut and edit the DNA. In order to conduct gene editing research, many single guide-RNA must be created. Researchers can use oligo pools for CRISPR gene editing to silence, through editing, DNA locations. This process creates an error at a particular location in the DNA of the cell, rendering that location unusable, in other words silenced. By studying the relationship between silenced regions and change in phenotype (did the disease get worse or better), researchers can find the genomic regions important to the disease and identify targets for therapeutics. Similar to our standard oligo pools, we offer oligo pools for CRISPR screening with a diverse and customizable set of specifications, including pool sizes ranging from a few hundred oligos to over one million. From oligo produced on a single silicon chip, researchers can edit up to 1,000,000 DNA locations. We currently offer oligo pools for CRISPR screening of up to 300 nucleotides in length, which in each oligo, allows for two guide-RNAs. As such, where previously researchers could study one region at a time, with the ability to create double guide-RNA pools, there is now the ability to study two regions simultaneously, which has the potential to expand the knowledge of a particular target or disease as well as the underlying biology. 
 Gene pools 
 The growth of the synthetic biology industry continues to see incredible innovation and new applications facilitated by unlimited access to the building blocks of research, including synthetic DNA at unprecedented scale. Where previously researchers worked in individual workflows with one gene in one tube, the explosion of biological information provides new opportunities to work in massively parallel workflows to exponentially accelerate the rate and scope of research. Gene pools are similar to oligo pools, but provide multiple genes within one test tube. Designed with the flexibility to have up to 180,000 genes in a single tube at an affordable price, we introduced gene pools in October 2019 as part of our new Twist Innovation Lab that continues to drive toward products that enable customers to innovate at the pace of todays research and truly change the world for the better. 
 Next generation sequencing (NGS) tools 
 We recently expanded the application of our DNA synthesis technology to develop products targeted at the large next generation sequencing market, or NGS. In particular, we are focused on addressing the demand for better sample preparation products that improve sequencing workflow, increase sequencing accuracy, and lower sequencing costs. Using our silicon-based DNA synthesis platform, we are able to synthesize the exact sequences of interest. In the target enrichment process, our synthetic DNA probes enrich bind the sequence of interest within the sample in order to isolate and physically extract the targeted segment of DNA. 
 The ability of the probes to bind to the target segment of interest impacts the ability to capture the correct DNA from the sample, which is subsequently sequenced. Though many factors can influence the efficiency of such capture, a primary consideration is how well the DNA sequence of the probe matches the target (sequence complementarity), as this affects both the efficiency and selectivity of capture. Our target enrichment capture probes are unique in the enrichment market as they consist of double stranded DNA. During the melt step the probes unwind, becoming two independent probes of complementary sequence. When the genome fragments unwind, both strands are captured independently. Each genome fragment can be sequenced twice. Also, with some genomic fragments, one of the two strands may be difficult to capture due to unfavorable sequence composition, as in some cancer mutations. By using double stranded probes, capture efficiency can be maximized as there are multiple opportunities to capture a single fragment. Data shows that uniform synthesis of probes is important for downstream productivity. Because we synthesize each probe individually, our solution allows genome fragments to be captured uniformly. 
 The targeted segment of DNA can then be copied uniformly prior to NGS analysis by our customers, yielding a larger volume of targeted segments in the sample used for sequencing. Because we are able to precisely target, extract, and uniformly amplify the target DNA segments, our solution considerably improves the accuracy of the 
 
8 


  downstream sequencing analysis. This enables our customers to perform fewer sequencing runs per sample, without sacrificing accuracy, saving them time and money. 
 Our NGS products are primarily used for diagnostic testing, research for population genetics and biomarker discovery, translational research, microbiology and applied markets. Our customers are primarily diagnostic companies and hospitals, research institutions, agricultural biotechnology companies, and consumer genetics companies conducting diagnostic tests for a wide range of applications. 
 In addition to our DNA probes, we have created a comprehensive sample preparation kit that combines these probes for NGS target enrichment with all the reagents and consumables necessary to process a sample into sequencing-ready material. This improves the NGS library preparation workflow and is a cost-effective solution that reduces sequencing costs, improves time to results, enhances sequencing coverage, and provides quality control on every DNA probe. Each of our NGS tool products include our individually synthesized DNA probes. 
 ISO Certification 
 In January 2019, our quality management systems for manufacturing our NGS Target Enrichment Panels in our Mission Bay San Francisco offices received ISO 9001:2015 and 13485:2016 certifications, the latter for medical device applications. In addition to continuing to provide NGS tools to our current customer base, we now have the ability to support customers in more regulated markets that require ISO certification from their key reagent suppliers. We anticipate obtaining these certifications for our new facility in South San Francisco in the first quarter of the calendar year 2020. 
 Human Core Exome Kit 
 A human genome is incredibly complex. Genes (the parts of the genome that encode proteins) are fragmented, scattered across the genome and surrounded by other DNA. That other DNA is required for maintaining the genomes integrity, for controlling each genes expression, and in some instances, its function still remains a mystery. A researchers aim in an exome sequencing experiment is to isolate the DNA sequences from a genomic sample containing only the protein coding regions called the exome. Only 1% of a human genome contains gene encoding regions, yet around 85% of genetic mutations known to cause disease occur in the exome. By isolating just these regions, the amount of genomic DNA that needs to be sequenced to get meaningful data about a disease can be lowered. Exome sequencing provides an important first pass screen for mutations. 
 The Twist Human Core Exome Kit includes the library preparation and enrichment components of the NGS sample preparation process for the entire known coding region of the genome for known inherited disease. Compared to traditional capture methods, our kit allows researchers to increase sample throughput, and achieve a higher depth of coverage across target regions with uncompromising quality. 
 Library Prep Kits 
 In addition to the complete human exome, we offer kits to accommodate a wide range of DNA. Sometimes DNA samples are degraded and need special materials to enhance the extraction of the DNA, particularly when the input sample is low quality. 
Fixed Panels 
 We offer a suite of products that have specific probes to address specific needs. We sell the Human RefSeq Panel to complement the Human Core Exome Kit. We sell the Pan-Viral Panel that contains over 1,000 viral human pathogens for rapid identification in various settings and the Mouse Exome Panel with the most current content in the industry.

 FastHyb 
 A key step in the sample preparation process is hybridization. This is the process whereby the probes are mixed with the genomic sample and then the target DNA is extracted. This step often takes many hours and can even take days, and is an important rate-limiting step in the sample preparation process. With our FastHyb solution, customers can complete the hybridization step in as little as 15 minutes, enabling the sample to be moved through the workflow and onto the sequencing step in a single day. 
 In our FastHyb and Wash Kit, the probes are mixed with the genomic sample and then heated to above 95°C to melt the base pair interactions in the double-stranded genomic DNA, forming a pool of single stranded DNA. Bringing the temperature down allows the genomic DNA to start to form back into complementary double stranded molecules. As the probes are designed to be complementary with the exome, they will also form base pair interactions with the genomic DNA. 
 Drug and Target Discovery Solutions 
 DNA libraries 
 DNA libraries are collections of DNA fragments that are primarily used by pharmaceutical companies during antibody discovery and development. During the drug discovery phase, a pharmaceutical company typically has a biological target or function of interest. In order to find antibodies that best bind to that target in a specific region of a gene and deliver a therapeutic effect, it may be necessary to test many variants of an antibody. Synthetic DNA libraries become useful in this process, as they produce customized, controllable groups of antibodies from specific DNA sequences to run through assays that assess function, toxicity and binding affinity. 
 Traditionally, pharmaceutical companies have generated antibody libraries through a process called random mutagenesis. This uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis, where PCR is used to introduce many sequence errors, or variations, within the copies of the antibody. While this generates many different antibody variants, the changes are entirely random and are unknown until the antibody DNA is sequenced. In addition, because of the random approach, there is no guarantee that the resulting antibodies will target the desired region of interest. 
 Our platform allows customers to customize every antibody variation and construct a precise library systematically to target the entire region of interest. We can create single site libraries in which we change one single amino acid (which is encoded by a group of three DNA nucleobases) within the sequence or single site saturation libraries in which we change every amino acid within the sequence for a more comprehensive approach. We can also generate combinatorial libraries in which we introduce changes to multiple sites within the same gene in specific ratios and combinations. These libraries can be used for antibody engineering, affinity maturation, and humanization, which simplifies downstream screening and identifies more lead molecules. Our libraries are explicitly developed for a specific area of the genome or tailored to a specific disease, with antibody compounds evenly represented across all areas of the genome desired. 
 To support our efforts to add further value for our customers and potential partners, we have developed a comprehensive antibody optimization solution to enable simultaneous optimization of multiple characteristics of a given antibody. We have developed custom software for the optimization of antibody hits, antibody compounds that meet pre-specified criteria for therapeutic development. We have added our high throughput and hyper-variant antibody library capabilities to create a comprehensive antibody optimization solution for potential partners. We are now using this solution to design, build and test hyper-variant, tightly controlled antibody libraries that follow the rules of the human repertoire and mitigate the pitfalls associated with traditional optimization methods. By following the rules of the human repertoire, which means including only DNA sequences known to occur in humans, these libraries will be natural in composition and are expected to generate better drug development candidates. The libraries also have a large degree of synthetic variation, enabling simultaneous optimization of several antibody characteristics and the discovery of antibodies with high affinity and specificity to drug targets. 
 
10 


 Additionally, we are leveraging our ability to rapidly generate custom libraries to discover novel therapeutic antibodies against biological targets that have traditionally been difficult for biological drug development. We have developed a proprietary antibody library targeting a major class of proteins known as GPCRs. GPCRs are important receptors that control and drive the biology of nearly all disease classes, including inflammation, cancer, metabolism, respiratory, and pain. According to a recent publication in Molecular Pharmacology, approximately 700 approved therapeutics target GPCRs, representing approximately 35% of all approved drugs. However, they remain a difficult class of targets for antibody development due to the lack of exposed protein surfaces to bind. We have created a series of single domain antibody libraries. Single domain antibody libraries are antibody fragments that are much smaller than a whole antibody. Where a whole antibody is composed of two heavy chains and two light chains, single domain antibodies are engineered from the heavy chain antibodies and are also called VHH fragments. These fragments are small and modular antibodies that are both stable and robust for potentially faster discovery and development. 
 Using our proprietary libraries, we have identified three different functional antibodies to the GLP1R receptor, an important target in type 2 diabetes and also Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. We may partner with other technology providers to advance development of our antibody discovery efforts. We expect to continue to develop additional libraries for screening and selection of other biological therapeutic targets such as ion channels and membrane-based transporters. 
 We believe we have several avenues available to monetize our antibody discovery program. For example, we anticipate that successful discovery of a novel therapeutic antibody against any single GPCR target would attract significant partnership interest from academic institutions as well as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies given the difficult nature of this class of antibody targets. These partnerships may include upfront, milestone and royalty payments to us for access to our GPCR library. 
 Collaboration with LakePharma 
 In April 2019, we announced a strategic collaboration with LakePharma to offer antibody discovery and development solutions to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. Under the terms of the agreement, LakePharma will have the ability to offer Twists proprietary antibody discovery and optimization platforms to their existing and future biopharmaceutical customers as part of their service offerings. One such Twist platform that may be offered is for discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies against a major class of protein drug targets known as GPCRs, which traditionally have been difficult for biologics drug development. GPCRs have been heavily investigated due to their involvement in multiple disease classes, including inflammation, cancer, metabolism, respiratory, and pain. In return, we may offer our customers access to LakePharmas integrated discovery and development services. Each of we and LakePharma will share with each other a percentage of certain revenues generated from customers who purchase services as a result of the collaboration. 
 Antibody Optimization Service for Pandion 
 In April 2019, we announced a new collaboration with Pandion Therapeutics, to apply our antibody optimization platform to the targeting arm of a bispecific antibody. The initial project required Twist to improve the affinity of an oncology bispecific antibody across multiple species for optimal preclinical testing, which was completed successfully. Based on that success, we are now working to optimize two additional antibodies for Pandion. 
 Our target markets 
 Our currently marketed product offering addresses a market opportunity that was approximately $1.8 billion in calendar year 2016. We believe our solution has the potential to materially expand our initial market by providing end-users with access to high-quality and lower cost tools, encouraging adoption and facilitating new applications for our products, such as pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery and digital data storage in DNA. 
 
11 


 Synthetic DNA market 
 We believe that our current market opportunity for synthetic DNA was approximately $1.3 billion in calendar year 2016. The market consists of those who buy DNA, or DNA Buyers, and those who make their own DNA, or DNA Makers. Driven by access to more affordable and high-quality synthetic DNA, we believe that there is a strong trend of DNA Makers converting to DNA Buyers. According to BCC Research, the size of the DNA Buyer market in 2016 was approximately $300 million and is growing at a rate of approximately 20% annually as existing DNA Buyers develop new uses for synthetic DNA and existing DNA Makers convert to DNA Buyers. We estimate our market opportunity in the DNA Maker market to be approximately $950 million. Our market estimate is based on the market sizes for products used in manual DNA synthesis, including the cloning and restriction digestion enzyme market in 2016, according to a report on Molecular Biology by Markets and Markets. 
 NGS sample preparation market 
 Our NGS sample preparation kits address the demand for better sample preparation products that improve the sequencing workflow, increase sequencing accuracy and lower sequencing costs. We offer kits consisting of double-stranded DNA probes and a comprehensive target enrichment kit that are used for exome sequencing and custom targeted sequencing. Kalorama Information, a division of marketresearch.com, estimates the market for sample preparation for next generation sequencing was approximately $500 million in calendar year 2016 and growing at approximately 20% annually. 
 In addition, we believe we have an opportunity to convert customers using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, or SNP arrays, to a workflow that uses Twist products for library preparation and target capture with sequencing on the NovaSeq platform. We believe this workflow can be less expensive than running DNA microarrays for SNP analysis and we intend to continue to enable this conversion. 
 SNP arrays are used extensively in the consumer DNA testing space as well as the agricultural biotech market. In the agricultural market, SNP arrays are used to genotype chicken, beef, salmon and other food products. We believe that together, these SNP array market segments represent a total market opportunity of $500 million. We do expect it to take time to penetrate this area of the market as the shift in workflow is substantial, though it could result in richer genotyping data at an attractive price per point compared to SNP arrays. 
 Pharmaceutical biologics drug discovery 
 We believe we are uniquely positioned to capture a larger portion of the drug discovery value chain given that our synthetic DNA products are already used by our pharmaceutical partners throughout the drug development process. As part of our effort in this market, we recently launched our custom DNA library solution which facilitates biologic drug discovery and development. We are already in agreement with a top three pharmaceutical company by revenue to supply our custom DNA libraries instead of them producing their own. In addition to our custom DNA libraries, we are also developing other proprietary tools, such as a wholly-owned GPCR library and an antibody optimization solution, that we believe will enable us to provide an end-to-end solution in biologics drug discovery and early development, from target to investigational new drug, or IND, application, and adding value as a partner to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These partnerships may include upfront, milestone and royalty payments. 
 Digital data storage in DNA 
 Due to the explosion of data across many industries, finding efficient means of storage has become more important. Through the Semiconductor Research Corporation, many leading semiconductor companies, including Microsoft Corporation, IBM Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Autodesk Inc., Mentor Graphics Corporation and GlobalFoundries Inc., are exploring DNA as a data storage medium. We have strategic relationships with 
 
12 


  Microsoft Corporation and the University of Washington through which we have demonstrated the feasibility of storing data on DNA and the unique benefits of longevity, density, and universality of this format. We believe that in three to five years, new DNA technologies and cost efficiencies could surpass mature information technology hardware solutions to allow data storage in DNA to become cost competitive with traditional storage media and enable us to target several large markets within data storage. The market for digital data storage is more than $35 billion and we believe DNA can address several segments within this market. 
 Our growth strategy 
 Our objective is to be the leading provider of synthetic DNA and DNA-based products worldwide and to leverage the versatility of our platform to build a leadership position in other synthetic DNA-based product markets in which we have a competitive advantage. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing on the following: 
 

 | Maintain and expand our position as the provider of choice for high-quality, affordable synthetic genes and DNA to customers across multiple industries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Become a leading supplier of NGS sample preparation products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | Conduct antibody therapeutic discovery and optimization for our current customers and future partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to explore development of DNA as a digital data storage medium via internal research and government and industry partnerships; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand our global presence.
--+----------------------------

 Beyond these opportunities, we are working with industry partners to create new markets for our products by leveraging the versatility of our platform. 
 Sales and marketing 
 We have built a versatile and scalable commercial platform that enables us to reach a diverse customer base that we estimate consists of over 100,000 synthetic DNA users, and many additional potential customers of our NGS library preparation products today. In order to address this diverse customer base, we have employed a multi-channel strategy comprised of a direct sales force targeting synthetic DNA customers, a direct sales force focusing on the NGS market and an e-commerce platform that serves both commercial channels. Our sales force is focused on customer acquisition, support, and management across industries, and is highly trained on both the technical aspects of our platform and how synthetic DNA can be used in a wide range of industries. Our easy-to-use e-commerce platform allows customers to design, validate, and place on-demand orders of customized DNA online, and enable them to receive real-time customized quotes for their products and track their order status through the manufacturing and delivery process. This is a critical part of our strategy to address our large market and diverse customer base, as well as drive commercial productivity, enhance the customer experience, and promote loyalty. We target customers of our NGS products through a direct sales team focused on the NGS tools market and which is separate from our synthetic DNA sales force. Our direct NGS sales representatives are focused on supporting our early adopters and providing a high level of service in order to familiarize customers with our product offering. 
 We sell our products through a worldwide selling organization that includes direct sales personnel, commercial consultants in Europe, Asia and China, an ecommerce platform and distributors. As of September 30, 2019, we employed 121 people in sales, marketing and customer support. We have three distributors in the Americas and 13 distributors in the rest of the world. Sales to distributors accounted for less than 5% of revenues in fiscal 2019. 
 In fiscal 2019, 66% of sales were derived from the United States, 27% from Europe and the Middle East, 3% from China, 2% from the rest of the Asia Pacific region, and 2% from Canada and Mexico. For financial information about geographic areas for each of our last three fiscal years, see Note 15, Geographic and product

  information, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. For a discussion of the risks attendant to our foreign operations, see Item 1A, Risk Factors-Our international operations expose us to material risks, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item. 
 Research and development 
 Our research and development expenses were $35.7 million in fiscal 2019, $20.3 million in fiscal 2018, and $19.2 million in fiscal 2017. As of September 30, 2019, we employed 100 people in engineering and research and development activities. 
 We are engaged in ongoing research and development efforts focused on enhancements to existing products and the development of new products. Currently, we are pursuing research and development projects with respect to the following: 
 

 | Process development for higher quality oligos;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | Optimization, automation and miniaturization of gene and NGS pipelines;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Silicon process and chemistry development for our data storage initiative;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Building a massively parallel screening facility for our pharma initiatives that allows us to screen over a dozen antibody phage display campaigns per week; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion of our product offering for oligo, gene and NGS products
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 Research and development activities are conducted in collaboration with manufacturing activities to help expedite new products from the development phase to manufacturing and to more quickly implement new process technologies. From time to time, our research and development efforts have included participation in technology collaborations with universities and research institutions. 
 Patents and other intellectual property rights 
 As of September 30, 2019, we own 14 issued U.S. patents and 3 issued international patents in China and 1 in Taiwan. There are 149 pending patent applications, including 48 in the United States, 91 international applications and 10 applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We rely on a combination of patent rights, copyrights and trade secrets to protect the proprietary elements of our products. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. 
 Manufacturing and facilities 
 The production of our products is a highly complex and precise process. Twist has approximately 9,000 square feet of manufacturing space, approximately 10,000 square feet of research and development space and approximately 41,000 square feet of office space located at our headquarters in South San Francisco, California. We currently manufacture all of our products and multiple sub-assemblies at these facilities. As of September 30, 2019, we had 102 full-time employees dedicated to manufacturing our synthetic genes, oligo pools and NGS tools and creating our DNA libraries. 
 All of our products originate from synthetic DNA obtained from nanostructured clusters fabricated on our proprietary silicon technology platform. Due to its on-demand nature, the gene synthesis business requires manufacturing operations to be in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days per year. For synthetic 
 
14 


  genes, we have built a highly scalable gene production process with what we believe is industry-leading capacity of approximately 45,000 genes per month to address the growing demand of scalable, high-quality, affordable synthetic genes. 
 In addition to synthetic genes, we are combining nanostructured clusters into oligo pools. If our production was dedicated entirely to the oligos, we currently have the capacity to produce more than 20 million high-quality oligos per month that can be combined into high-precision oligo pools of various sizes. The pooling process has been fully automated through a mixture of custom proprietary and over-the-counter liquid handling equipment. We are currently only utilizing approximately two thirds of this production capacity for synthetic genes and oligos. We intend to increase our shipments to leverage our production capacity through our e-commerce platform, which we believe will expand both our market opportunity and our customer base. 
 The manufacturing process for our NGS tools is highly flexible and scalable and requires minimal fixed costs and direct labor given the efficiency of our production capability. We have automated the entire workflow using proprietary and over-the-counter laboratory equipment. We have built dedicated production capabilities for our NGS products. 
 We take substantial measures to safeguard our intellectual property and keep our advanced and proprietary technology within the United States. We have kept and will maintain all front-end advanced technology in the United States. To support the rapidly growing Asian genomics and NGS markets, we are in the process of establishing a production site in China for the back-end manufacturing of the Next Generation Sequencing product line incorporating the same rigorous biosecurity screening system as our other sites. Our advanced front-end manufacturing facilities to create our synthetic DNA products will remain in the United States as well as the accompanying IP. We believe that structuring our manufacturing in this manner will allow us to offer comparable delivery times for customers in the Asian market. This also brings our industry-leading biosecurity screening program into the Asian market, allows us to protect ourselves from potential export tariffs in both countries, while simultaneously allowing us to protect our intellectual property and to satisfy the needs of our customers. 
 Over time, to further improve our production process, we intend to outsource various sub-assemblies to third-party manufacturers. 
 We initially certified our Quality Management System (QMS) to the ISO 9001:2000 standard and in 2019 updated our certification to ISO 9001:2008. ISO is an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems. Subsequent audits by the registrar have been and will continue to be carried out at regular intervals to ensure we are maintaining our system in compliance with ISO standards. Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification. Also, we have our QMS certified to the ISO 13485:2012 Quality Management Standard and the Canadian Medical Devices Regulation (CMDR). These standards include a special set of requirements specifically related to the supply of medical devices and related services. Additionally, we manufacture to current FDA Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and our QMS is implemented in accordance with FDA Quality System Regulations (21 CFR 820). 
 Supply chain 
 We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and 
 
15 


  cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Competition 
 The synthetic biology industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by price competition, technological change, international competition, product turnaround time and manufacturing yield problems. The competitive factors in the market for our products include: 

 | price;
--+-------


 | product quality, reliability and accuracy;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | product offering & complexity;
--+-------------------------------


 | turnaround time;

--+-------------------------------

 Regarding these factors, we face competition from a broad range of providers of core synthetic biology products such as GenScript Biotech Corporation, GENEWIZ (owned by Brooks Automation), Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (owned by Danaher), DNA 2.0 Inc. d/b/a/ ATUM, GeneArt (owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), Eurofins Genomics LLC, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Company), Promega Corporation, OriGene Technologies, Inc., Blue Heron Biotech, LLC and others. Additionally, we compete with both large and emerging providers in the life sciences tools and diagnostics industries focused on sample preparation for next generation sequencing such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Illumina, Inc., Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Agilent Technologies, Inc., and Roche NimbleGen, Inc. In the antibody discovery market, we compete with clinical research organizations, such as LakePharma (mouse hybridoma, llama immune libraries, XOMA phage display library) and Aldevron, LLC (genetic mouse immunization coupled with hybridoma), and antibody discovery biotechnology companies, such as Iontas (human phage display libraries, human phage display library focused on ion channels), Adimab (human synthetic yeast display libraries), and Distributed Bio (human synthetic phage display library, lead optimization libraries). In the field of DNA digital data storage, we compete with Catalog Technologies, Inc., ETH Zurich, Helixworks, Iridia, Inc., North Shore Bio and Roswell. 
 Employees 
 At September 30, 2019, we employed 414 employees, of whom 100 were primarily engaged in engineering and research and development activities, 121 in marketing, sales and customer support, 146 in operations and manufacturing and 47 in general and administration. Of these employees, 320 hold engineering or science degrees, including 69 Ph.D.s. 
Seasonality 
 Over the years, we have experienced a pattern, although not consistently, of our third-quarter revenue growth being lower than revenue growth in other quarters due to a decrease in demand from Ginkgo Bioworks during such quarter and recent revenue fluctuations in our NGS tools. As we continue to grow our NGS tools, our revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. As our European business becomes a larger percentage of our revenues, we anticipate reduced revenue in our fourth quarter due to the seasonal slowdown at our customers European facilities caused by summer vacations and European holiday schedules.

 Government regulation 
 The synthetic biology industry and our current product portfolio is largely unregulated by governmental bodies such as the FDA. Our products are also not intended to be components or incorporated into our customers products. Rather, our synthetic DNA products enable our customers to develop a wide spectrum of commercial products, some of which may require governmental approval. If a customers product requires governmental approval, as would be the case with the development of medical diagnostics and therapeutic drugs, it is the customer who seeks and obtains the required governmental approval to commercialize those products. However, in the future we may be subject to a variety of specialized regulatory requirements, including potential regulation by the FDA, any of which could have a material effect on the business. 
 Research Use Only, or ROU, is a term limited to our target enrichment products for the next-generation sequencing market and is specifically applied only to kits sold to this market segment, and is intended to restrict use of the kits to non-in vitro diagnostic purposes. The RUO label is not affixed to any other products. Our NGS target enrichment and library preparation products are used in a more comprehensive workflow for next generation sequencing. It is this larger workflow that can become an in vitro diagnostic, after undergoing the appropriate regulatory processes. As noted above, our NGS products target a market opportunity for NGS sample preparation that was approximately $500 million in calendar year 2016 and growing at approximately 20% annually, according to market research provided by Kalorama Information, a division of marketresearch.com. This market estimate represents the NGS target enrichment products which are limited solely to the RUO component of target enrichment and library preparation and does not include the full in vitro diagnostic workflow. 
 While most of the current laws and regulations concerning synthetic biology relate to the end products produced using synthetic biology, this may change. For example, in December 2010, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues recommended that the federal government oversee, but not regulate, synthetic biology research. The Presidential Commission also recommended that the federal government lead an ongoing review of developments in the synthetic biology field and that the federal government conduct a reasonable risk assessment before the field release of synthetic organisms. 
 While we and our subsidiaries maintain regulatory compliance practices, we rely on our customers compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the products they produce. We do not independently monitor whether our customers comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
 FDA 
 Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices. 
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared devices are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a Premarket Approval Application, or PMA. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II. Class II classification usually requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDC Act, referred to as 510(k) clearance. Most Class I devices are exempt from this requirement, as are some lower risk Class II devices. When 
 
17 


  a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) process. 
 In vitro diagnostics, or IVDs, are a category of medical devices that include reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. IVDs are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body. A research use only, or RUO, IVD product is an IVD product that is in the laboratory research phase of development. As such, an RUO IVD is not intended for use in clinical investigations or in clinical practice. Such RUO products do not require premarket clearance or approval from the FDA, provided that they be labeled For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures pursuant to FDA regulations. 
 As presently contemplated, none of our IVD products are intended for clinical or diagnostic use, and we market them to academic institutions, life sciences and clinical research laboratories that conduct research, and biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for non-diagnostic and non-clinical purposes. Our current IVD products are marketed and labeled as RUO, and are provided to our customers solely for their internal research use. Accordingly, we believe that our current IVD products are subject only to limited regulation with respect to labeling by the FDA, and we have not sought clearance or approval from the FDA to market our products. 
 In November 2013, the FDA issued final guidance indicating that merely including the RUO labeling statement will not necessarily render the device exempt from FDA premarket clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intended its IVDs for diagnostic use. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, the products advertising, labeling, or promotion, or the manufacturers assistance of a clinical laboratory in validating or verifying a test that incorporates products labeled RUO. We do not believe any of these circumstances apply to our current product portfolio. 
 While we believe that none of our current IVD products require FDA approval or clearance, we may in the future develop and commercialize a subset of our products or related applications that could become subject to additional regulation by the FDA. If we market our products for use in performing clinical diagnostics, thus subjecting them to additional regulation by the FDA, including premarket and post market control as medical devices, we would be required to obtain either prior 510(k) clearance or prior pre-market approval from the FDA before commercializing the product, unless an exemption applies. 
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Outside of the European Union, or EU, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order to market medical devices. 
 FSAP 
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service administer requirements of the Federal Select Agent Program, or FSAP. FSAP requirements govern possession, use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products. It is our policy generally not to produce or otherwise work with material that is subject to FSAP requirements. 
 Export controls 
 Some sequences we produce may be subject to licensing requirements for export outside of the United States under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). 
 
18 


 Given the evolving nature of our industry, legislative bodies or regulatory authorities may adopt additional regulation or expand existing regulation to include our service. Changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, could arise at any time, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain comparable regulatory approval or clearance of our service, if required. These regulations and restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
