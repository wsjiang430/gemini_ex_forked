ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
RW Holdings NNN REIT, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation formed on May 14, 2015. The Company elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2016 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, Rich Uncles NNN Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our “Operating Partnership” and to their subsidiaries. We expect to conduct our business substantially through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.
We intend and continue to invest primarily in single tenant income-producing properties which are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases. Although we are not limited as to the form our investments may take, our investments in real estate will generally constitute acquiring fee title or interests in entities that own and operate real estate. We will make acquisitions of our real estate investments directly through our Operating Partnership or indirectly through limited liability companies or limited partnerships, including through other REITs, or through investments in joint ventures, partnerships, tenants-in-common, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with other owners of properties, affiliates of our advisor, Rich Uncles NNN REIT Operator (our “Advisor”) or other persons.
Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is externally managed by our Advisor pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (as amended, the “Advisory Agreement”) with our Advisor and BrixInvest, LLC (f/k/a Rich Uncles, LLC) (referred to herein as “Brix” or our “Sponsor”). Brix also serves as the sponsor for affiliated Rich Uncles Real Estate Investment Trust I (“REIT I”) and BRIX REIT, Inc. (“BRIX REIT,” f/k/a Brix Student Housing REIT, Inc.) and affiliates of Brix serve as their advisors. Our Advisor, which is wholly-owned by our Sponsor, manages our operations and our portfolio of core real estate properties and real estate related assets. Our Advisor also provides asset management, and other administrative services on our behalf. Our Advisor is paid certain fees as set forth in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
We have investor relations personnel, but all expenses are reimbursed by our Sponsor as part of the organizational and offering services they provide to us to manage our organization and offering and provide administrative investor relations services. However, our Sponsor is then entitled to include the reimbursement of such expenses as part of our reimbursement to them of organizational and offering costs, but reimbursement shall not exceed an amount equal to 3% of our initial public offering gross offering proceeds.
On June 24, 2015, our Sponsor purchased 10,000 shares of common stock for $100,000 and became our initial stockholder. On December 31, 2015, our Sponsor purchased another 10,000 shares of common stock for $100,000 or total holdings of 20,000 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, the Sponsor held 10,740 shares of the Company’s Class C common stock. 
On July 15, 2015, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to register an initial public offering of a maximum of $900,000,000 in shares of common stock for sale to the public (the “Primary Offering”). We also registered a maximum of $100,000,000 of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the “Registered DRP Offering”) and, together with the Primary Offering, the “Registered Offering”. The SEC declared our registration statement effective on June 1, 2016 and, on July 20, 2016, we began offering shares of common stock to the public. Pursuant to the Registered Offering, we sell shares of our “Class C” common stock directly to investors, with a minimum investment in shares of $500. Commencing in August 2017, we began selling shares of Class C common stock only to U.S. persons as defined under Rule 903 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
On August 11, 2017, we began offering up to 100,000,000 shares of Class S common stock exclusively to non-U.S. Persons as defined under Rule 903 promulgated under the Securities Act pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act (the “Class S Offering” and, together with the Registered Offering the “Offerings”). The Class S common stock has similar features and rights as the Class C common stock, including with respect to voting and liquidation except that the Class S common stock offered in the Class S offering may be sold through brokers or other persons who may be paid upfront and deferred selling commissions and fees.
On January 11, 2019, our board of directors approved and established an estimated net asset value (“NAV”) per share of our common stock in the Offerings of $10.16. Effective January 14, 2019, the purchase price per share of our common stock in the Offerings increased from $10.05 to $10.16.
4

Through December 31, 2018, we had sold 14,027,968 shares of Class C common stock in the Registered Offering, including 903,901 shares of Class C common stock sold under the Registered DRP Offering, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of $140,507,461, and 17,588 shares of Class S common stock in the Class S Offering, including 167 shares of Class S common stock sold under our dividend reinvestment plan applicable to Class S common stock, for aggregate gross offering proceeds of $176,604.
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2016. If we meet the REIT qualification requirements, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the income that we distribute to our stockholders each year. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any year after electing REIT status, our income will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and cash available for distribution to our stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and will operate in a manner that will enable us to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and we intend to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes thereafter.
Investment Objectives and Strategies
Overview
We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from the Offerings to acquire and manage a portfolio of real estate investments. We intend to invest primarily in single tenant income-producing commercial properties which are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases. While our focus is on single tenant net leased properties, we plan to diversify our portfolio by geography, investment size, investment risk, tenant and lease term with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income-producing real estate investments that provides attractive and stable returns to our stockholders. Our investment objectives and policies may be amended or changed at any time by our board of directors. Although we have no plans at this time to change any of our investment objectives, our board of directors may change any and all such investment objectives, including our focus on single tenant properties, if it believes such changes are in the best interests of our stockholders. We intend to notify our stockholders of any change to our investment policies by disclosing such changes in a public filing such as a prospectus supplement, or through a filing under the Exchange Act, as appropriate. There can be no assurance that our policies or investment objectives will be attained or that the value of our common stock will not decrease.
Primary Investment Objectives
Our primary investment objectives are:

• | to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions; and


• | to preserve and return stockholder capital contributions.

We will also seek to realize growth in the value of our investment by timing the sale of our properties to maximize asset value. We may return all or a portion of stockholder capital contributions in connection with the sale of the Company or our properties.
While initial purchases of our properties will be funded with funds received from the sale of shares in the Offerings, we anticipate incurring mortgage debt (not to exceed 50% of the total value of all of our properties) against individual properties and/or pools of individual properties and pledging such properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional properties.
Investment Strategy
We will seek to acquire a portfolio consisting primarily of single tenant net leased properties throughout the United States diversified by corporate credit, physical geography, product type, and lease duration. Although we have no current intention to do so, we may also invest a portion of the net proceeds in single tenant net leased properties outside the United States. We intend to acquire assets consistent with our single tenant acquisition philosophy by focusing primarily on properties:

• | where construction is substantially complete to reduce risks associated with construction of new buildings;


• | leased on a “net” basis, where the tenant is responsible for the payment, and fluctuations in costs, of real estate and other taxes, insurance, utilities, and property maintenance;


• | located in primary, secondary and certain select tertiary markets;


• | leased to tenants with strong financial statements, including, but not limited to investment grade credit quality, at the time we acquire them; and

5


• | subject to long-term leases with defined rental rate increases.

We will seek to provide our stockholders the following benefits:

• | a cohesive management team experienced in all aspects of real estate investment with a track record of acquiring single tenant net leased properties;


• | stable cash flow backed by a portfolio of single tenant net leased real estate assets;


• | minimal exposure to operating and maintenance expense increases via the net lease structure where the tenant assumes responsibility for these costs;


• | contractual rental rate increases enabling higher potential distributions and a hedge against inflation;


• | insulation from short-term economic cycles resulting from the long-term nature of the tenant leases;


• | enhanced stability resulting from strong credit characteristics of most of the tenants; and


• | portfolio stability promoted through geographic and product type investment diversification.

There can be no assurance that any of the properties we acquire will result in the benefits discussed above. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Investments in Single Tenant Real Estate.
General Acquisition and Investment Policies
We seek to make investments that satisfy the primary investment objective of providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders. However, because a significant factor in the valuation of income-producing real property is its potential for future appreciation, we anticipate that some properties we acquire may have the potential both for growth in value and for providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders.
Although this is our current focus, we may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forgo a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. We believe that we are most likely to meet our investment objectives through the careful selection of assets. When making an acquisition, we will emphasize the performance and risk characteristics of that investment, how that investment will fit with our portfolio-level performance objectives, the other assets in our portfolio and how the returns and risks of that investment compare to the returns and risks of available investment alternatives. Thus, to the extent that our Advisor presents us with what we believe to be good investment opportunities that allow us to meet the REIT requirements under the Internal Revenue Code, our portfolio composition may vary from what we initially expect. However, we will attempt to construct a portfolio that produces stable and attractive returns by spreading risk across different real estate investments.
Our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific properties. However, acquisition parameters will be established by our board of directors. We and our Advisor consider a number of factors in the selection, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | tenant creditworthiness;


• | lease terms, including length of lease term, scope of landlord responsibilities if any under the net lease context, and frequency of contractual rental increases;


• | projected demand in the area;


• | a property’s geographic location and type;


• | proposed purchase price, terms and conditions;


• | historical financial performance;


• | a property’s physical location, visibility, curb appeal and access;


• | construction quality and condition;


• | potential for capital appreciation;


• | demographics of the area, neighborhood growth patterns, economic conditions, and local market conditions;


• | potential capital reserves required to maintain the property;


• | the potential for the construction of new properties in the area;


• | evaluation of title and obtaining of satisfactory title insurance;


• | evaluation of any reasonable ascertainable risks such as environmental contamination; and


• | replacement use of the property in the event of loss of existing tenant (no special use properties).

There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire or on the percentage of net offering proceeds that may be invested in any particular property type or single property. The number and mix of properties will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition and the amount of proceeds from the Offerings.
6

Creditworthiness of Tenants
In the course of making a real estate investment decision, we assess the creditworthiness of the tenant that leases the property we intend to purchase. Tenant creditworthiness is an important investment criterion, as it provides a barometer of relative risk of tenant default. Tenant creditworthiness analysis is just one element of due diligence which we perform when considering a property purchase, and the weight we intend to ascribe to tenant creditworthiness is a function of the results of other elements of due diligence.
Some of the properties we intend to acquire will be leased to public companies. Many public companies have their creditworthiness analyzed by bond rating firms such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These firms issue credit rating reports which segregate public companies into what are commonly called “investment grade” companies and “non-investment grade” companies. We expect that our portfolio of properties will contain a mix of properties that are leased to investment grade public companies, non-investment grade public companies, and non-public companies (or individuals).
The creditworthiness of investment grade public companies is generally regarded as very high. As to prospective property acquisitions leased to other than investment grade tenants, we intend to analyze publicly available information and/or information regarding tenant creditworthiness provided by the sellers of such properties and then make a determination in each instance as to whether we believe the subject tenant has the financial fortitude to honor its lease obligations.
We do not intend to systematically analyze tenant creditworthiness on an ongoing basis, post-acquisition. Many leases will limit our ability as landlord to demand on recurring bases non-public tenant financial information. It will be our policy and practice, however, to monitor public announcements regarding our tenants, as applicable, and tenant payment histories.
Description of Leases
We expect, in most instances, to acquire single tenant properties with existing net leases. “Net” leases typically require tenants to pay all or a majority of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes, special assessments and sales and use taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance charges, and building repairs related to the property, in addition to the lease payments. There are various forms of net leases, typically classified as triple-net or double-net. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Most of the leases also will contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent payable at points during the lease term. Triple-net leases typically require the tenant to pay common area maintenance, insurance, and taxes associated with a property in addition to the base rent and percentage rent, if any. Double-net leases typically require the landlord to be responsible for structural and capital elements of the leased property. We anticipate that most of our acquisitions will have remaining lease terms of five to 15 years at the time of the property acquisition. We may acquire properties under which the lease term has partially expired. We also may acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is located in a desirable location, is difficult to replace, or has other significant favorable real estate attributes. Generally, the leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. We may elect to obtain, to the extent commercially available, contingent liability and property insurance, flood insurance, environmental contamination insurance, as well as loss of rent insurance that covers one or more years of annual rent in the event of a rental loss. However, the coverage and amounts of our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover our entire risk.
Tenants are required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing a certificate of insurance to our Advisor on an annual basis. The insurance certificates will be tracked and reviewed for compliance.
Our Borrowing Strategy and Policies
We may incur indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties, and publicly or privately placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders. We may obtain a credit facility or separate loans for each acquisition. Our indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our properties. We may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new properties, to pay for capital improvements, repairs or build-outs, to refinance existing indebtedness, to fund repurchases of our shares or to provide working capital. To the extent we borrow on a short-term basis, we may refinance such short-term debt into long-term, amortizing mortgages once a critical mass of properties has been acquired and to the extent such debt is available at terms that are more favorable than the existing debt.
7

There is no limitation on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any individual property. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets, and we currently intend to utilize up to 50% leverage in connection with our acquisition strategy. Our charter limits our borrowing to 50% of our tangible assets, unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our conflicts committee composed of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with the justification for such increase. When calculating our use of leverage, we will not include temporary, unsecured borrowing for property acquisitions under a revolving credit facility (or similar agreement).
We may borrow amounts from our Advisor or its affiliates only if such loan is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our conflicts committee, not otherwise interested in the transaction, as fair, competitive, commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties under the circumstances.
Except as set forth in our charter regarding debt limits, we may re-evaluate and change our debt strategy and policies in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we could consider when re-evaluating or changing our debt strategy and policies include then-current economic and market conditions, the relative cost of debt and equity capital, any acquisition opportunities, the ability of our properties to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to equity in connection with any change of our borrowing policies.
Acquisition Structure
Although we are not limited as to the form our investments may take, our investments in real estate will generally constitute acquiring fee title or interests in entities that own and operate real estate.
We will make acquisitions of our real estate investments directly through our Operating Partnership or indirectly through limited liability companies or limited partnerships, or through investments in joint ventures, partnerships, tenants-in-common, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with other owners of properties, affiliates of our Advisor or other persons. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate.
Real Property Investments
Our Advisor will be continually evaluating various potential property investments and engaging in discussions and negotiations with sellers regarding the purchase of properties for us and other programs sponsored by our Sponsor. We expect to have adequate insurance coverage for all properties in which we invest. Most of our leases will require that our tenants procure insurance for both commercial general liability and property damage. In such instances, the policy will list us an additional insured. However, lease terms may provide that tenants are not required to, and we may decide not to, obtain any or adequate earthquake or similar catastrophic insurance coverage because the premiums are too high, even in instances where it may otherwise be available. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate.
Conditions to Closing Acquisitions
Our Advisor performs a diligence review on each property that we purchase. As part of this review, our Advisor in most, if not all cases, obtains an environmental site assessment for each proposed acquisition (which at a minimum includes a Phase I environmental assessment). We will not close the purchase of any property unless we are generally satisfied with the environmental status of the property. We will also generally seek to condition our obligation to close the purchase of any investment on the delivery of certain documents from the seller. Such documents include, where available and appropriate:

• | property surveys and site audits;


• | building plans and specifications, if available;


• | soil reports, seismic studies, flood zone studies, if available;


• | licenses, permits, maps and governmental approvals;


• | tenant leases and estoppel certificates;


• | tenant financial statements and information, as permitted;


• | historical financial statements and tax statement summaries of the properties;


• | proof of marketable title, subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to us; and


• | liability and title insurance policies.

8

Co-Ownership Investments
We may acquire some of our properties in the form of a co-ownership, including but not limited to tenants-in-common and joint ventures, some of which may be entered into with affiliates of our Advisor. Among other reasons, we may want to acquire properties through a co-ownership structure with third parties or affiliates in order to diversify our portfolio of properties in terms of geographic region or property type. Co-ownership structures may also allow us to acquire an interest in a property without requiring that we fund the entire purchase price. In addition, certain properties may be available to us only through co-ownership structures. In determining whether to recommend a particular co-ownership structure, our Advisor will evaluate the subject real property under the same criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We may enter into joint ventures with affiliates of our Advisor for the acquisition of properties, but only provided that:

• | a majority of our directors, including a majority of our conflicts committee, not otherwise interested in the transaction, approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us; and


• | the investments by us and such affiliate are on substantially the same terms and conditions.

To the extent possible and if approved by our board of directors, including a majority of our conflicts committee, we will attempt to obtain a right of first refusal or option to buy the property held by the co-ownership structure and allow such co-owners to exchange their interest for our Operating Partnership’s units or to sell their interest to us in its entirety. Entering into joint ventures with affiliates of our Advisor will result in certain conflicts of interest.
Real Estate Properties and Investments
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 24 operating properties and one parcel of land, which currently serves as an easement to one of our office properties. For more information about our real estate investments, see Part I, Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Real Estate-Related Investments
As of December 31, 2018, we owned an approximate 72.7% tenant-in-common interest in a Santa Clara office property (the “TIC Interest”) and an approximate 4.8% interest in REIT I, an affiliated REIT.

This property is financed by a mortgage note of $18,850,000 with an annual interest rate of 4.85% which matures on January 1, 2030.
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our Advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, acquisition or origination and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations and leasing of our portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our Advisor is unable to provide these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.
Competitive Market Factors
The U.S. commercial real estate investment and leasing markets remain very competitive. We face competition from various entities for investment opportunities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, private equity and other investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic location of their investments. Competition from these entities may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Further, as a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively, there is significant competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively.
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Our business will be subject to many laws and governmental regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and courts, occur frequently.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Complying with the ADA requirements could require us to remove access barriers. Failing to comply could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. Although we intend to acquire properties that substantially comply with these requirements, we may incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. In addition, a number of additional federal, state and local laws may require us to modify any properties we purchase, or may restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access by disabled persons. Additional legislation could impose financial obligations or 
10

restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons. Although we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on us, if required changes involve a greater amount of expenditures than we currently anticipate, our ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances. These laws often impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigating, removing or remediating these substances may be substantial, and the presence of these substances may adversely affect our ability to rent properties or sell the property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may expose us to liability resulting from any release of or exposure to these substances. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location, we may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating these substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by us. We may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site that we own or operate. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. We maintain a pollution insurance policy for all of our properties to insure against the potential liability of remediation and exposure risk. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate.
Other Regulations
The properties we acquire likely will be subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as zoning and state and local fire and life safety requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants. We intend to acquire properties that are in material compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, we cannot assure you that these requirements will not change or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Industry Segments
Our current business consists of owning, managing, operating, leasing, acquiring, investing in and disposing of commercial real estate assets. All of our consolidated revenues are derived from our consolidated real estate properties. We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view all of our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment.
Employees
