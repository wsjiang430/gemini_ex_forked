Item 1. | Business

References herein to “we”, “us”, “our”, “Company”, and “TreeHouse” refer to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise.
We are a consumer packaged food and beverage manufacturer operating over 40 manufacturing facilities across the United States, Canada, and Italy servicing primarily retail grocery and food away from home customers. We manufacture a variety of shelf stable, refrigerated, fresh, and frozen products. We have a comprehensive offering of packaging formats and flavor profiles, and we also offer natural, organic, and preservative-free ingredients in many categories. 
The Company was incorporated on January 25, 2005 by Dean Foods Company to accomplish a spin-off of certain specialty businesses to its shareholders, which was completed on June 27, 2005. Since the Company began operating as an independent entity, it has expanded its product offerings through a number of strategic and bolt-on acquisitions. We manufacture and sell the following:

• | private label products to retailers, such as supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers, for resale under the retailers’ own or controlled labels,


• | private label and branded products to the foodservice industry, including foodservice distributors and national restaurant operators,


• | branded products under our own proprietary brands, primarily on a regional basis to retailers,


• | branded products under co-pack agreements to other major branded companies for their distributions, and


• | products to our industrial customer base for repackaging in portion control packages and for use as ingredients by other food manufacturers.

Our reportable segments, and the principal products that comprise each segment, are as follows:

Net sales are relatively evenly distributed across segments:
See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by segment.
We operate our business as Bay Valley Foods, LLC ("Bay Valley"), Sturm Foods, Inc., S.T. Specialty Foods, Inc., Cains Foods, Inc., Associated Brands, Inc., Protenergy Natural Foods, Inc., Flagstone Foods, Inc., TreeHouse Private Brands, Inc., American Italian Pasta Company, Nutcracker Brands, Inc., Linette Quality Chocolates, Inc., Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc., Cottage Bakery, Inc., and The Carriage House Companies, Inc. in the United States, E.D.

Bay Valley is a Delaware limited liability company, and a 100% owned subsidiary of TreeHouse. All operating units are directly or indirectly 100% owned subsidiaries of Bay Valley.
Significant Divestitures and Acquisitions
On February 1, 2016, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Ralcorp Holdings, Inc., the corporation through which the private brands business of ConAgra Foods, Inc. (“Private Brands Business”) was operated. The Private Brands Business is a leading manufacturer of private label refrigerated and shelf stable products in the bars, bakery, cereal, condiments, pasta, and snacks categories. Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. was renamed TreeHouse Private Brands, Inc. during the first quarter of 2016.
On April 25, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its canned soup and infant feeding (“SIF”) business. The SIF business is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and produced private label condensed and ready-to-serve soup, baby food, and gravies for the Meals segment. The transaction closed on May 22, 2017 and final working capital adjustments were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Customers and Distribution
We sell our products through various distribution channels, including grocery retailers, foodservice distributors, and industrial and export, which includes food manufacturers and repackagers of foodservice products. We have an internal sales force that manages customer relationships and a broker network for sales to retail, foodservice, and export accounts. Industrial food products are generally sold directly to customers without the use of a broker. Most of our customers purchase products from us either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that generally are terminable at will.
Products are shipped from our production facilities directly to customers, or from warehouse distribution centers where products are consolidated for shipment to customers if an order includes products manufactured in more than one production facility or product category. We believe this consolidation of products enables us to improve customer service by offering our customers a single order, invoice, and shipment. Some customers also pick up their orders at our production facilities or distribution centers.
We sell our products to a diverse customer base, including the leading grocery retailers and foodservice operators in the United States and Canada, and also a variety of customers that purchase bulk products for industrial food applications. We currently supply more than 1,000 total customers in North America, including over 50 of the 75 largest non-convenience food retailers.
A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 59.0% of our consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 22.2%, 22.0%, and 18.7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Costco Wholesale Corporation accounted for approximately 10.3% of consolidated net sales in 2017, with less than 10% in 2018 and 2016. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Total trade receivables with Walmart Inc. and affiliates represented less than 10.0% and 21.8% of our total trade receivables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, when taking into account those receivables sold under our Receivables Sales Agreement (refer to Note 6 for more information). Total trade receivables with Aldi represented approximately 12.0% and 12.2% of our total trade receivables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total trade receivables with Costco represented approximately 6.4% of our total trade receivables as of December 31, 2017. The Company had revenues from customers outside of the United States of approximately 9.0%, 8.8%, and 8.7% of total consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, with 6.9%, 6.8%, and 6.9% from Canada in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Sales are determined based on the customer destination where the products are shipped.
Backlog
We generally ship our products from inventory upon receipt of a customer order. Sales order backlog is not material to our business.
Competition
Our business faces intense competition from large branded manufacturers and highly competitive private label and foodservice manufacturers. In some instances, large branded companies manufacture private label products. The industries in which we compete are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Our customers do not typically commit to buy predetermined amounts of products, and many retailers utilize bidding procedures to select vendors.
We have several competitors in each of our channels. For sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are product quality, quality of service, and price. For sales of products to foodservice, industrial, and export customers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, specifications, and reliability of service.
Competition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers generally is based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Some of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do.
Recent trends impacting competition include an increase in snacking and awareness of healthier and “better for you” foods. These trends, together with a surge of specialty retailers who cater to consumers looking for either the highest quality ingredients, unique packaging, products to satisfy particular dietary needs, or value offerings where consumers are looking to maximize their food purchasing power, create pressure on manufacturers to provide a full array of products to meet customer and consumer demand.
6

We believe our strategies for competing in each of our business segments, which include providing superior product quality, effective cost control, an efficient supply chain, successful innovation programs, and competitive pricing, allow us to compete effectively.
Trademarks
We own a number of registered trademarks. While we consider our trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not consider any trademark to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business. No trademark is material to any one segment.
Seasonality
In the aggregate, our sales are generally weighted slightly toward the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced impact on profitability. As our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products. Products that show a higher level of seasonality include non-dairy powdered creamer, coffee, specialty teas, cappuccinos, hot cereal, saltine and entertainment crackers, in-store bakery items, refrigerated dough products, and certain pasta products, all of which generally have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters. Additionally, sales of broth and snack nuts are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Warmer weather products such as dressings, pickles, and condiments typically have higher sales in the second quarter, while drink mixes generally show higher sales in the second and third quarters. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the first and third quarters due to inventory builds, while cash flow is highest in the second and fourth quarters following the seasonality of our sales.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Our raw materials consist of ingredients and packaging materials. Principal ingredients used in our operations include casein, cheese, cocoa, coconut oil, coffee, corn and corn syrup, cucumbers, eggs, fruit, non-fat dry milk, nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts, and pecans), oats, palm oil, peppers, rice, soybean oil, sugar, tea, tomatoes, and wheat (including durum wheat). These ingredients are generally purchased under supply contracts. We believe these ingredients generally are available from a number of suppliers. The cost of raw materials used in our products may fluctuate due to weather conditions, regulations, fuel prices, energy costs, labor disputes, transportation delays, political unrest, industry, general U.S. and global economic conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The most important packaging materials and supplies used in our operations are cartons, composite cans, corrugated containers, glass, metal cans, metal closures, and plastic. Most packaging materials are purchased under long-term supply contracts. We believe these packaging materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials and packaging supplies can adversely affect our performance, as price changes often lag behind changes in costs, and we are not always able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material and supply costs.
For additional discussion of the risks associated with the raw materials used in our operations, see Part 1, Item 1A – Risk Factors and Item 7 - Known Trends and Uncertainties.
Working Capital
Our short-term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital and are generally highest in the first and third quarters as inventory levels increase relative to other quarters, due to the seasonal nature of our business. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the first and third quarters, while cash flow is highest in the second and fourth quarters following the seasonality of our sales.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, our work force consisted of approximately 12,700 full-time employees, with 10,600 in the United States, 2,000 in Canada, and 100 in Italy.
Regulatory Environment and Environmental Compliance
The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, labeling, safety, transportation, and use of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we operate. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations that apply to our businesses.
7

We are subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business including laws relating to water consumption and treatment, air quality, waste handling and disposal, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental compliance requirements.
The cost of compliance with national and international laws does not have, and is not expected to have, a material financial impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
