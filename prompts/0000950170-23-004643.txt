 Our Mission
Our mission is to transform data, analytics and expertise into healthcare commercial intelligence. We help clients uncover the right markets, opportunities and people, so they can shape tomorrow’s healthcare industry. Our SaaS platform creates new paths to commercial success in the healthcare market, so companies can identify where to go next.
 Overview
Definitive Healthcare is a leading provider of healthcare commercial intelligence. Our solutions provide accurate and comprehensive information on healthcare providers and their activities to help our customers optimize everything from product development to go-to-market planning and sales and marketing execution. Delivered through our SaaS platform, our intelligence has become important to the commercial success of our over 3,000 customers as of December 31, 2022. We generally define a customer as a company that maintains one or more active paid subscriptions to our platform.
 Our healthcare commercial intelligence platform brings together comprehensive, in-depth and high-quality intelligence, a powerful artificial intelligence (“A.I.”) engine, and an intuitive front-end SaaS platform, which have all been built, modified and improved upon over the last 12 years to create a highly differentiated offering.
 Definitive Healthcare was founded in 2011 and incorporated as Definitive Healthcare Corp. in May 2021 for the purposes of facilitating an IPO of its Class A Common Stock, which was completed on September 17, 2021. The Company is headquartered in Framingham, MA. Our primary website address is www.definitivehc.com. The information on our website is not incorporated herein or otherwise part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The Definitive Healthcare Platform
Our SaaS-based healthcare commercial intelligence platform provides comprehensive and accurate information on the healthcare ecosystem in the U.S. The platform uses deep analytics and data science to help customers develop data-driven strategic decisions such as finding new markets to enter, building comprehensive go-to-market strategies, accessing tactical information to help target the right decision makers and improving win rates with detailed contextual information. All of this helps our customers succeed in this important but complicated industry.
Our Data Sources and Data Engine
Our comprehensive, high-quality healthcare commercial intelligence is made up of thousands of data sources and billions of data points that enrich and power our platform. We transform this data into intelligence through A.I. and machine learning (“M.L.”) algorithms that ingest, cleanse, link and analyze the data to create powerful new intelligence and analytics. Each new data source and each new algorithm created by our data science team makes our entire platform and the intelligence modules contained within more valuable to our clients. Built and enhanced since our inception, our platform contains a full 360-degree, longitudinal view of the healthcare ecosystem and depicts how the ecosystem connects together, creating a true barrier to entry.
Our Competition and Competitive Strengths
We operate in a highly fragmented market. We have a competitive advantage that is based on our comprehensive dataset built up over 12 years, our application of the data science, which has created proprietary intelligence and linkages that we do not see elsewhere, and a user interface that provides customers access to answers, not data, in an integrated manner. Our competitive strengths include:
•Proprietary Healthcare-specific Commercial Intelligence. We have built proprietary intelligence via first-party research, aggregated, linked, cleansed and inferred information from thousands of data sources and we have tied billions of data points together into a comprehensive view of the entire U.S. healthcare ecosystem. 
 •An Integrated Data and Technology Foundation that Creates a Flywheel of Innovation. Our technology platform provides the foundation for rapid product development and innovation by leveraging our existing data assets to produce new modules and features that solve a growing number of business problems. 
 •Powerful Go-to-Market Engine. We have a highly efficient and effective go-to-market engine that combines effective marketing with an inside sales force comprised of highly trained, vertically focused sales executives. 
 •Visionary Management Team with a Track Record of Execution. Our management team has a strong track record of exceptional financial performance and of building an award-winning culture to attract and retain highly talented individuals. 
 While we believe no competitor matches our breadth of data and intelligence solutions or offers as comprehensive and accurate a commercial intelligence platform, we compete either directly or indirectly with:
•Legacy raw claims data providers, such as Clarivate, IQVIA and Symphony Health; 
 •Niche healthcare specialists, such as Komodo Health, H1 Healthcare, Marketware, Trella Health and Trilliant Health; 
 •Ecosystem players that may house or analyze similar intelligence, such as SG2 and Veeva; and 
 •Horizontal go-to-market intelligence platforms, such as ZoomInfo, LinkedIn and Dun & Bradstreet. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are:
•Depth, breadth and accuracy of healthcare-specific commercial intelligence; 
 •Healthcare subject matter expertise; 
 •A.I. and data science capabilities; 
 •Ease of use and deployment; and 
 •Data privacy and security.
 Our Growth Strategies
We intend to drive growth through the following strategies:
•Acquiring new customers
 •Expanding our relationships with existing customers
 •Continuing to innovate to strengthen our platform and market leadership position
 •Making selective strategic acquisitions and investments


Our Customers
Our integrated platform is designed to drive commercial success for companies that sell into or compete in the healthcare ecosystem, creating large end-markets for us, including life sciences, healthcare information technology ("HCIT"), healthcare providers and other diversified companies, such as staffing firms, commercial real estate firms, financial institutions and other organizations seeking commercial success in the attractive, but complex, healthcare ecosystem.
Our Go-to-Market Strategy
We have a very efficient go-to-market model, driven by a high-velocity inside sales and marketing team, experienced sales engineers (“SEs”) and a well-defined verticalized sales strategy.
Our go-to-market strategy begins with a high-velocity marketing engine that generates more than 10,000 inbound Marketing Qualified Leads (“MQLs”) each year. These inbound leads are quickly converted into demos for our SEs, who are organized into specific verticals. This vertical specialization ensures that each SE understands the specific business problems of their customers and can guide them through an online demo to the exact intelligence that will be most impactful to their business. As our brand presence continues to grow, we have seen a significant increase in the number of inbound MQLs received.
We complement our marketing efforts with a highly targeted outbound effort focused on important prospects across our target universe of over 100,000 companies, with an estimated total addressable market of more than $10 billion. These companies are prioritized and targeted with a measurable outbound effort led by our inside sales representative team.
Once a new company signs up as a subscriber, they are transferred to our Customer Experience managers (“CX”) who assist with onboarding and training, answering questions and maintaining a “health score,” a predictive metric used to determine whether customers are likely to renew their subscription. In addition, an SE is typically assigned to each customer, with a focus on deepening the relationship and identifying opportunities to expand the relationship to new departments and sell additional intelligence modules and workflow products. The CX and SE teams are also organized by vertical end market to ensure appropriate subject matter expertise.
Human Capital at Definitive Healthcare
 Our community has continued to grow rapidly since our founding 12 years ago. While our people are primarily concentrated in the Boston metro area, we have expanded globally and increased our reach with a flourishing remote employee base.
As of December 31, 2022, our workforce included 974 employees — of whom 946 were employed full time and 30% were fully remote. 729 employees were based in the U.S., 69 were based in Europe, and another 176 were based in India. Functionally, our workforce includes 517 in sales and marketing, 361 in product development, and 96 in general and administrative roles. Our workforce also included four independent contractors as of such date. Our workforce is comprised of a wide variety of professionals, including business development representatives, data scientists, software engineers, and more.
 People and culture
 We consistently receive workplace accolades. In 2022, we were recognized by The Boston Globe as a Top Place to Work for the sixth consecutive year. We have also been awarded Energage’s “Top Workplace in the US” and have been recognized as a best place to work by the Boston Business Journal’s “Best Place to Work” for five of the past six years.
 We are committed to putting our community first. For us that means centering our culture around collaboration and community engagement. DefinitiveCares, our employee-led charitable organization, is at the core of our company culture. The mission of DefinitiveCares is to give back to the community through employee-led volunteer initiatives.
 As a company, we are collaborative, energetic, approachable, and driven. These attributes have allowed us to develop and maintain our customer-focused culture, where we aren't afraid to roll up our sleeves to get the job done. We also realize that there's more to life than work, so we try to have some fun together and ensure that every employee maintains a healthy work-life balance.
 

Diversity, equity, and inclusion
 At Definitive Healthcare, we invite everyone to come as they are. We value our employees' unique perspectives, backgrounds, and voices because these diverse experiences drive new ideas and help us build a better community. We provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop awareness around diversity, equity, and inclusion through company-sponsored speakers and presentations. We promote diversity and inclusion in our hiring processes by training our hiring managers on unconscious bias, by engaging with diverse student groups at college fairs, by increasing our work visa sponsorship program, and by incorporating inclusive, gender-neutral language into our job descriptions.
 In addition, our employee-led affinity groups provide a way for everyone to come together and share their common experiences. Alongside their allies, these employees promote a sense of community, belonging, and understanding at Definitive Healthcare. The affinity groups include Women's Empowerment @ DHC, Out @ DHC (LGBTQIA), Black, Indigenous, and People of Color @ DHC, Working Parents, and AVID @ DHC (visible and invisible disabilities), as well as a wide variety of clubs and special interest groups.
 Health, wellness, and total rewards
Our goal is to offer a best-in-class total rewards package that supports employees and their families, attracts top talent, and ensures pay equity. We provide competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain high quality talent. As part of our total rewards package, U.S. employees are eligible for variable compensation and we pay for employees' individual full medical coverage, in addition to providing generous healthcare, investment, retirement, and paid time off.
 Promoting a culture that supports health and well-being continues to be a priority for the organization. After initially transitioning to a fully remote work approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have since implemented and chosen to maintain a hybrid work environment, enabling all employees to work between our offices and remotely, which we believe enables greater flexibility for a successful work-life balance. In 2022, we implemented unlimited paid time off and expanded parental leave for U.S.-based employees. This year we also introduced email-free weekends and an educational assistance and reimbursement program.
We reward high performance and effort, regardless of experience or title. We recognize employees who do exceptional work four times a year through our Rockstars awards. The awards are granted to those who embody our guiding principles in extraordinary ways, and recipients are determined by employee nominations.
Employee Development and Advancement
 Our people are our greatest asset. Enabling their career growth and upward mobility is critical to retaining and engaging our talent. We provide employees with the tools, learning, and internal opportunities to find their path and build the skills and abilities to take on new roles. As part of our offerings, we provide a comprehensive learning management system, with a mix of professional, technical, managerial, and leadership development programs across a number of learning pathways.
 Each year, we conduct a robust talent review process that includes performance assessments and goal setting to enable growth and employee advancement while creating alignment with both company goals and values. This process ties into our compensation strategy to ensure that we reward and incentivize our high performers.
 Intellectual Property
Our data driven platform and our approach to keeping it current is our defensive moat and protecting our intellectual property is a crucial aspect of our business. While, as of December 31, 2022, we have not pursued any patents, we secure and protect our intellectual property rights in material unregistered intellectual property by entering into invention assignment contracts with all of our employees and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, customers and other parties with whom we conduct business and share confidential information to control access to our proprietary information, technology and processes.
We continually assess our strategy with respect to the protection of new intellectual property and intend to pursue additional avenues to intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be cost-effective and beneficial to our business.
Data Privacy and Security
The healthcare and customer-level data we collect, process, use and disclose from healthcare organizations and professionals are integral to enabling us to provide a comprehensive healthcare commercial intelligence platform to our customers. Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. We are passionate about protecting the information we collect and have rigorous policies and processes in place to adhere to the applicable laws, including the de-identification standards under the HIPAA de-identification rules. All patient-level personal information we collect is de-identified by third parties before we receive it so it never enters our network in an identifiable format. Additionally, we engage a qualified third-party to, at least annually, assess and certify our compliance with the HIPAA de-identification rules.
In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the CCPA, the CPRA, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act of 2021 (the "VCDPA"), the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), and the United Kingdom's GDPR (“UK GDPR”) govern the privacy and security of personal information and personal data, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing. We strive to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws, and we closely monitor the development of similar legislation across the United States and the globe. Additionally, we have developed a privacy center, including privacy notices on our website to describe our practices related to the collection, maintenance, security, use and sharing of personal information on our platform and otherwise.
