Item 1. Business.
General
 
GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. (“GlassBridge”) is a holding company. Our wholly-owned subsidiary GlassBridge Asset Management, LLC (“GBAM”) is an investment advisor focused on technology-driven and quantitative strategies.
 
As used in this document, the terms “GlassBridge”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries and consolidated entities unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
Asset Management Business
 
Our Asset Management business is currently comprised of two distinct businesses. One of these businesses focuses on liquid equity strategies that employ primarily technology-driven and quantitative strategies. The other business, our joint venture with Roc Nation, focuses on venture capital and private equity. Within the liquid investment space, we intend to use algorithms and other quantitative strategies with the goal of achieving consistent, competitive risk-adjusted returns for GBAM’s investors. In February 2017, we closed a transaction with Clinton Relational Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. (“Clinton”) which facilitated the launch of our asset management business (the “Capacity and Services Transaction”). The Capacity and Services Transaction allows for GBAM to initially place up to $1 billion of investment capacity under Clinton’s management within Clinton’s quantitative equity strategy for a five-year term. We have the option of expanding such investment capacity to $1.5 billion and to extend the term for two subsequent one-year periods, subject to certain conditions.
 
The Capacity and Services Transaction was structured to provide for the quick and efficient scaling of an asset management business and designed to provide investors with access to quantitative equity strategies.
 
From late in 2016 through early 2017 we took steps to build our own independent organizational foundation, which we intend to utilize together with Clinton’s abilities and infrastructure. While our intention is to primarily engage in the management of third-party assets, we may make opportunistic proprietary investments from time to time that comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
In June 2017, we launched our first GBAM-managed investment fund (the “GBAM Fund”) which focuses primarily on technology-driven quantitative equity strategies. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any assets invested in the GBAM Fund.
 
We intend to earn revenues in our Asset Management Business primarily by providing investment advisory services to third party investors through GlassBridge managed funds as well as separate managed accounts. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each fund’s portfolio (including the purchase, retention and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, policies and restrictions), conducting investment research, monitoring compliance with each fund’s investment restrictions and applicable laws and regulations, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors and monitoring such sub-advisors’ investment performance and adherence to investment policies, risk management and compliance procedures, overseeing other service providers, maintaining public relations and marketing programs for each of the funds, preparing and distributing regulatory reports and overseeing distribution through third party financial intermediaries. We anticipate that our revenues will increase or decrease as our average assets under management rises or falls. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees may vary from fund to fund.
 
We have delegated day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to Clinton as sub-advisor to our initial quantitative fund pursuant to the Capacity and Services Transaction. Clinton will not collect a fee for such services going forward as we issued 1,250,000 shares of common stock of the Company to Clinton’s affiliate in connection with the closing of the Capacity and Services Transaction.
 
In March 2017, ARRIVE was formed through a collaboration with Roc Nation, a full-service entertainment company founded by Shawn “JAY Z” Carter, Primary Venture Partners (“Primary”) and GBAM. Primary will serve as a venture advisor and GlassBridge will provide institutional and operational support. ARRIVE was created to invest alongside entrepreneurs and early stage businesses. Among other things, ARRIVE has launched traditional venture funds in order to, among other activities, support existing portfolio companies through their subsequent growth stages and other special purpose investment vehicles to invest in private equity transactions.
 
We believe that GlassBridge’s status as a public reporting company is an ideal platform from which to grow our Asset Management Business. The existing reporting, compliance and other regulatory requirements to which GlassBridge is subject provide transparency which is intended to provide investors with insight, scrutiny and comfort.

The success of our Asset Management Business will depend in large part on our ability to create investment products and raise capital from third party investors. If we are unable to raise capital from third party investors, we would be unable to collect management fees or deploy their capital into investments and potentially collect performance fees, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and cash flow from this business.
 
The investment advisory industry is intensely competitive. We compete with many domestic and global competitors that may provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial institutions.
 
Poor performance of any investment funds we sponsor or accounts we manage, including, without limitation, any fund or account managed or sub advised by Clinton pursuant to the Capacity and Services Transaction, would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, income and cash flow, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds and accounts.
 
The ability of Clinton to perform services under the Capacity and Services Transaction will depend on the efforts of its key personnel and the performance of its overall business. There is no guarantee that Clinton’s key personnel will remain available to devote sufficient time, or any time at all, to the performance of these services, or that Clinton’s business overall will not experience other adverse events. If Clinton’s key personnel are not available, or Clinton’s business experiences other adverse events, Clinton may not be able to perform adequately, or at all, the services it is required to perform, and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
 
Difficult market and economic conditions, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates and volatile equity and credit markets, can adversely affect our asset management business in many ways; including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by any investment funds we sponsor or accounts we manage, including, without limitation, any fund managed by Clinton, and reducing our ability to raise or deploy capital; each of which could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.
 
Any revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow attributable to our Asset Management Business is likely to be highly variable, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline and be volatile.
 
We are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect investors of investment advisors, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations.
 
Please see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the risks relating to the launch and growth of our Asset Management Business.
 
Nexsan Business
 
The Nexsan Business consisted of products of Nexsan and Connected Data, Inc. (“CDI”). We acquired the Nexsan brand at the end of 2012 and began operations in 2013. In October 2015, we acquired substantially all the equity of CDI as well as the Transporter brand. As described in the section below titled The NXSN Sale and in more detail in Note 4 – Discontinued Operations, the Company completely divested itself of the Nexsan Business and all related obligations, liabilities and interests in or to any part of that business.
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5 people worldwide, with approximately 4 employed in the United States and 1 employed internationally.
 
The NXSN Sale
 
On August 16, 2018, the Company completed the disposition of its entire interest in the Nexsan Business, as described herein.
 
On August 16, 2018, we simultaneously acquired all of the capital stock of NXSN Acquisition Corp. (together with its subsidiaries, “NXSN”) from Humilis Holdings Private Equity LP f/k/a Spear Point Private Equity LP (“Humilis”) and sold all of the capital stock of the Nexsan Group (as defined herein) (collectively the “NXSN Sale”) to StorCentric, Inc. (the “Buyer”), a newly-incorporated Delaware company affiliated with Drobo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Drobo”) for $5,675,000.

The Legacy Businesses
 
Following the completion of the Restructuring Plan (as defined below), we no longer operate our Legacy Businesses. The wind down of our Legacy Businesses was completed in early 2016. During the execution of the Restructuring Plan, our strategy was to maximize cash flows, extract working capital from these businesses and manage our cost structure efficiently as we wound down the businesses.
 
When we conducted our Legacy Businesses, the Imation brand was for many years at the forefront of data storage and digital technology. Imation brand products included magnetic tape media, recordable CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, flash products and hard disk drives.
 
Company History
 
GlassBridge was incorporated as Imation Corp. in Delaware in 1996 from the spin-off of substantially all the businesses that comprised the data storage and imaging systems groups of 3M Company. Until 2015, we primarily provided data storage and security solutions through our two legacy business segments: Consumer Storage and Accessories and Tiered Storage and Security Solutions, which we refer to as our “Legacy Businesses.”
 
We have, however, undergone a period of significant changes. Beginning with the proxy contest led by Clinton in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders in 2015 and continuing until February 2017, we underwent a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) led by our management, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its Strategic Alternatives Committee. Since the proxy contest, our evolution has included a re-composition of the Board, changes in the compensation structures of the Board and management and the execution of the Restructuring Plan which included the elimination of unprofitable businesses and the harvesting of capital from the liquidation of non-core assets.
 
Beginning in September 2015, the Board, management and the Strategic Alternatives Committee adopted the Restructuring Plan to begin the process of discontinuing our Legacy Businesses, a decision which resulted from continued losses due to secular declines and which was aimed to reduce our cost structure and streamline our organization. Following the wind down of our Legacy Businesses, we then developed and explored strategies and alternatives to create stockholder value by deploying our excess capital. The Restructuring Plan also called for the rapid rationalization of our corporate overhead. We incurred approximately $120 million in total charges for the Restructuring Plan, excluding tax impact. The charges were mostly non-cash, with cash charges of approximately $34 million.
 
We closed a transaction in January 2017 with NXSN, an affiliate of Spear Point Capital Management LLC (“Spear Point”), pursuant to which all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Nexsan was sold to NXSN in exchange for 50% of the issued and outstanding common stock of NXSN and a $25 million senior secured convertible promissory note (the “NXSN Transaction” and the “NXSN Note” respectively). Prior to the consummation of the NXSN Transaction, we contributed all the issued and outstanding stock of CDI to Nexsan. The NXSN Transaction was designed to provide for third-party investment in the Nexsan business to enhance Nexsan’s growth and support its recent product developments, minimize our need to make this investment in Nexsan ourselves and preserve the potential for equity value upside from Nexsan’s ongoing development and market penetration. While the results of the NXSN Transaction initially met our expectations, Spear Point’s management of and investment in NXSN and Nexsan proved to be both inadequate and in violation of the NXSN Transaction agreements. Accordingly, on November 14th, 2017, we invoked the rights resulting from such violations to exercise the voting rights created thereby and re-take management control of the Nexsan subsidiaries and business.
 
In February 2017, we closed a transaction with Clinton which has facilitated the launch of our asset management business (the “Capacity and Services Transaction”). The Capacity and Services Transaction allows for GBAM to place investment capacity under Clinton’s management within Clinton’s quantitative equity strategy. The Capacity and Services Transaction was structured to provide for the quick and efficient scaling of an asset management business and designed to provide investors with access to quantitative equity strategies. We intend to use algorithms and other quantitative strategies with the goal of achieving consistent, competitive risk-adjusted returns for GBAM’s investors. In addition, we have recently taken steps to build our own independent organizational foundation while utilizing Clinton’s abilities and infrastructure. While our intention is to primarily engage in the management of third-party assets, we may make opportunistic proprietary investments from time to time that comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
In February 2017, the Company effected a 1:10 reverse split of our common stock, without any change in the par value per share (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and decreased the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 100,000,000 to 10,000,000.

In February 2017, we changed our name to GlassBridge Enterprises, Inc. to reflect our new primary focus on asset management.
 
In June 2017, we launched the GBAM Fund as described above under “Asset Management Business.”
 
On July 20, 2017, the Company notified the NYSE of its intention to voluntarily delist its common stock from the NYSE. After much careful discussion and deliberation, our Board approved resolutions authorizing the Company to initiate voluntarily delisting from the NYSE. The Board weighed several material factors in reaching this decision, including avoiding the risks that involuntary suspension of trading could cause and the importance of a controlled transition to the OTCQX marketplace (the “OTCQX”) to ensure the continuing availability of a market for trading our common stock. The last trading day on the NYSE was August 1, 2017. Our common stock began trading on the OTCQX under the symbol “GLAE” on August 2, 2017.
 
As described above, on August 16, 2018, the Company closed the NXSN Sale, and all related transactions contemplated therein, completely divesting itself of all related businesses, opportunities, liabilities and obligations related to.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Asset Management Business is our only operating business segment.
