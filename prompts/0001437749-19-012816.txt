ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 
National Beverage Corp. innovatively refreshes America with a distinctive portfolio of sparkling waters, juices, energy drinks ("Power+ Brands"), and to a lesser extent,  carbonated soft drinks. We believe our creative product designs, innovative packaging and imaginative flavors, along with our corporate culture and philosophy, make National Beverage unique as a stand-alone entity in the beverage industry.
 
Points of differentiation include the following:
 
Healthy Transformation – We focus on developing and delighting consumers with healthier beverages in response to the global shift in consumer buying habits and lifestyles. We are committed to tailoring the variety and types of beverages in our portfolio to satisfy the preferences of a diverse mix of consumers including ‘crossover consumers’ – a growing group desiring a healthier alternative to artificially sweetened or high-calorie beverages.
Flavor Innovation – Building on a rich tradition of flavor and brand innovation with more than a 130 year history of development with iconic brands such as Shasta® and Faygo®, we have extended our flavor and essence leadership and technical expertise to the sparkling water category. Proprietary flavors and our naturally-essenced beverages are developed and tested in-house and only made commercially available after extensive concept and sensory evaluation. Our variety of distinctive flavors provides us a unique advantage with today’s consumers who demand variety and refreshing beverage alternatives.
Innovation Ethic – We believe that innovative marketing, packaging and consumer engagement is more effective in today’s marketplace than traditional higher-cost national advertising. In addition to our cost-effective social media platforms, we utilize regionally-focused marketing programs and in-store “brand ambassadors” to interact and obtain feedback from our consumers. We also believe the design of our packages and the overall optical effect of their placement on the shelf (“shelf marketing") has become more important as millennials and younger generations become increasingly influential consumers, and are now influencing baby boomers and older generations.
 
 2


Creative Dynamics – In a beverage industry that is dominated by the “cola giants”, we pride ourselves on being smaller, faster and stronger. We believe we are able to respond faster and more creatively to consumer trends than competitors who are burdened by legacy production and distribution complexity and costs. The ability to identify consumer trends and create new product concepts to lead the market defines our new product development model. Speed to market with the appropriate concept, unique flavor creation and trend-forward ‘better-for-you’ ingredients continues to be our goal. Internal development teams are responsible for concept creation, packaging and design, which allow for rapid ‘go to market’ timing and reduced development costs.
 
Presently, our primary market focus is the United States and Canada. Certain of our products are also distributed on a limited basis in other countries and options to expand distribution to other regions are being considered.
 
National Beverage Corp. is incorporated in Delaware and began trading as a public company on the NASDAQ Stock Market in 1991. In this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and “National Beverage” mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries unless indicated otherwise.
 
BRANDS
 
Our brands consist of beverages geared to the active and health-conscious consumer (“Power+ Brands”) including sparkling waters, energy drinks, and juices. Our portfolio of Power+ Brands includes LaCroix®, LaCroix Cúrate®, LaCroix NiCola® and Shasta® Sparkling Water products; Rip It® energy drinks and shots; and Everfresh®, Everfresh Premier Varietals™ and Mr. Pure® 100% juice and juice-based products. Additionally, we produce and distribute carbonated soft drinks including Shasta® and Faygo®, iconic brands whose consumer loyalty spans more than 130 years.

Power+ Brands –
 
LaCroix
 
LaCroix® Sparkling Water, our most significant brand, has uniquely redefined the Sparkling Water category that is rapidly becoming the alternative to traditional carbonated soda. With zero calories, zero sweeteners and zero sodium, the innocence of LaCroix has propelled it to the top-selling domestic sparkling water. Naturally essenced, LaCroix has gained the support of national retailers in multiple channels, including mass-merchandisers, club stores, drug stores, mainstream supermarkets and natural and specialty food retailers.
 
LaCroix’s dynamic ‘theme’ LaCroix Cúrate® (‘Cure Yourself’) celebrates French sophistication with Spanish zest and bold flavors. Cúrate naturally refreshes in tall 12 oz. consumer-favored cans. Eloquent graphics, robust aroma, naturally ‘essenced’ and premium-priced, Cúrate is an innovative addition to a brand that is the healthy alternative for today’s consumers.
 
NiCola® by LaCroix, an innovative sparkling water, captures the ‘crossover’ cola consumers with its ‘innocent’ effect of no calories, sodium, sweetener or any other ingredient that the health-conscious consumer avoids. NiCola is designed for those cola and diet cola consumers within the $82 billion U.S. carbonated soft drink market that are looking to continue to quench their cola-craving taste without negative health consequences. In late fiscal year 2019, we introduced three new additions to our LaCroix NiCola theme − Coconut Cola, Cubana (Mojito), and Coffea Exotica (Sumatra coffee and cola).
 
Additional LaCroix themes are in development and feature unique packaging, ground-breaking flavor concepts, and a go-to-market strategy designed to maximize cultural demographic concepts.
 
Shasta Sparkling
 
Shasta® Sparkling Water duplicates the iconic flavors that have charmed loyal Shasta consumers over the past 130 years with the first genuine soft-drink alternative (SDA).  Shasta Sparkling is naturally-essenced without calories, sodium and sweeteners.  ‘Simply Natural and Smartly Healthy,’ Shasta Sparkling complements a healthier lifestyle with its eloquent design and packaging in tall 10.5 ounce cans with an industry-first “clean” label.

Everfresh and Mr. Pure
 
Everfresh® and Mr. Pure® 100% juice and juice drinks are available in a variety of flavors, from such classics as Orange, Cranberry and flavored lemonades to exotics that include Premium Papaya, Pineapple Mango, Peach Watermelon and Island Punch. Distributed primarily in the Midwest, the brands’ signature package is a hot-filled, 16 oz. glass bottle primarily for single-serve consumption.
 
Everfresh Premier Varietals™, a unique theme from Everfresh, is positioned as a stand-alone brand for display in the produce section of supermarkets. Everfresh Premier Varietals is a premium line of natural apple juice derived from a variety of apples specific to the taste of the varietal, such as Granny Smith, McIntosh, Honey Crisp, Golden Delicious, Fuji and Pink Lady.
 
Rip It
 
RIP IT® Energy Fuel continues as a “Mission Tradition®” by proudly supporting our troops at home and abroad with 14 unique flavors and six sugar-free options. With its unique positioning, Rip It also continues to energize its growing fan base of gamers and athletes. Building on the flavor tradition of original Rip It, a 2 oz. sugar-free shot version in eight flavors is marketed through our distribution system in displayable package configurations.
Carbonated Soft Drinks – 
 
Celebrating its 130th year, Shasta® is recognized as a bottling industry pioneer and innovator. Shasta features multiple flavors, including products targeted to the growing Hispanic and other ethnic markets, and has earned consumer loyalty by delivering value and convenience with such unique tastes as Raspberry Crème, Tiki Punch, and California Dreamin’. More than 110 years old, Faygo® products are primarily distributed east of the Mississippi River and include numerous unique flavors including Red Pop®, Moon Mist®, and Rock’n’Rye®.

We tailor our marketing and promotion programs by geographic area; many of our carbonated soft drink brands enjoy a regional identification that fosters long-term consumer loyalty and makes them more competitive as a consumer choice. In addition, products produced locally may generate retailer-sponsored promotional activities and receive media exposure through community activities rather than costly national advertising.

 
In recent years we reformulated many of our brands to reduce caloric content while still preserving their time-tested flavor profiles. Our brands, optically and ingredient-wise, are always a work in process. We continually strive to make all our drinks healthier while maintaining their iconic taste profiles.
 
PRODUCTION
 
Our philosophy emphasizes vertical integration; our production model integrates the procurement of raw materials and crafting flavors and concentrates with the production of finished products. Our twelve strategically-located production facilities are near major metropolitan markets across the continental United States. The locations of our facilities enable us to efficiently produce and distribute beverages to substantially all geographic markets in the United States, including the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas. Each facility is generally equipped to produce both canned and bottled beverage products in a variety of package sizes.
 
We believe the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our production facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely on independent third-party bottlers to manufacture and market their products. Since we control all national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage quality control and consumer appeal while responding quickly to changing market conditions.
 
We craft a substantial portion of our flavors and concentrates. By controlling our own formulas throughout our bottling network, we are able to produce beverages in accordance with uniform quality standards while innovating flavors to meet changing consumer preferences. We believe the combination of a Company-owned bottling network, together with uniform standards for packaging, formulations and customer service, provides us with a strategic advantage in servicing national retailers and mass-merchandisers. We also maintain research and development laboratories at multiple locations. These laboratories continually test products for compliance with our strict quality control standards as well as conduct research for new products and flavors.

DISTRIBUTION
 
To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers, as well as thousands of smaller “up-and-down-the-street” accounts, we utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
 
The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, club stores, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers, drug stores and dollar stores. We distribute our products to this channel primarily through the warehouse distribution system and, to a lesser extent, the direct-store delivery system.

 
Under the warehouse distribution system, products are shipped from our production facilities to the retailer’s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its store locations with other goods. This method allows our retail partners to further maximize their assets by utilizing their ability to pick-up product at our warehouses, thus lowering their/our product costs. Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer’s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
 
We distribute our products to the convenience channel through our own direct-store delivery fleet and those of independent distributors. The convenience channel consists of convenience stores, gas stations and other smaller “up-and-down-the-street” accounts. Because of the higher retail prices and margins that typically prevail, we have developed packaging and graphics specifically targeted to this market.
 
Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers. Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to certain schools and other food-service customers.
 
Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands. We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers. We believe vending and cooler equipment expands on-site visual trial, thereby increasing sales and enhancing brand awareness.


SALES AND MARKETING
 
We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks. Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines. We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.

Our marketing emphasizes programs designed to reach consumers directly through innovative digital marketing, digital social marketing, social media engagement, sponsorships and creative content. We are focused on increasing our digital presence and capabilities to further enhance the consumer experience across our brands. We may retain agencies to assist with social media content creative and platform selection for our brands.
 
Additionally, we maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty through a combination of participation in regional events, special event marketing, endorsements, consumer coupon distribution and product sampling. We offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, ‘BrandED’ ambassadors, in-store promotional activities and other incentives. These elements allow marketing and other consumer programs to be tailored to meet local and regional demographics.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of ingredients and packaging. By consolidating the purchasing function for our production facilities, we believe we are able to procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as an efficient producer of beverages.
 
The products we produce and sell are made from various materials including aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles, water, carbon dioxide, juice and flavor concentrates, sweeteners, cartons and closures. We craft a substantial portion of our flavors and concentrates while purchasing the remaining raw materials from multiple suppliers.
 
Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials. A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities. Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions. In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.

Seasonality
 
Our operating results are affected by numerous factors, including fluctuations in costs of raw materials, holiday and seasonal programming and weather conditions. Beverage sales are seasonal with higher volume realized during summer months when outdoor activities are more prevalent.
Competition
 
While LaCroix® Sparkling Water is the brand of choice as the number one sparkling water in 41 of the 52 Nielsen metropolitan statistical areas, the beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position may vary by market area. Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including water products, soft drinks, juices, fruit drinks, energy drinks and sports drinks, as well as powdered drinks, coffees, teas, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages. We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products. Several competitors, including those that dominate the beverage industry, such as Nestlé S.A., PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products may adversely affect sales of our brands.
 
Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail
 space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods. We believe our Company differentiates itself through novel methods of innovation, key brand recognition, focused social media, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, and, for some product lines, value pricing.
 
TRADEMARKS
 
We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business. We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.

Governmental Regulation
 
The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Lanham Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
 
Certain states and localities require a deposit or tax on the sale of certain beverages. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been proposed in certain other states and localities, as well as by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted or what impact its enactment would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position. We believe our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of April 27, 2019, we employed approximately 1,640 people, of which 380 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
