Item 1. Business 
GENERAL 
 We are a blank check company incorporated in October, 2020 as a Delaware corporation (the “Company” or “TLG”) whose business purpose is to effect a business combination with one or more businesses (the “initial business combination”). We have reviewed a number of opportunities to enter into an initial business combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete the pending Business Combination or another initial business combination should the proposed Business Combination not occur. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 In October 2020, we issued an aggregate of 8,625,000 Class F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, the founder shares, to TLG Acquisition Founder LLC, our sponsor, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Subsequently, in October 2020, our sponsor sold 431,250 founder shares to John Michael Lawrie at their original purchase price, which were subsequently contributed by Mr. Lawrie to an affiliate of our sponsor. In January 2021, our sponsor transferred 40,000 founder shares to each of our independent directors (collectively, together with our sponsor and its affiliate referenced in the prior sentence, the “Initial Stockholders”) at their original purchase price. In January 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 0.15942029 of a share of Class F common stock for each outstanding share of Class F common stock, resulting in the Initial Stockholders holding an aggregate of 10,000,000 founder shares. In January 2022, our sponsor forfeited for no consideration 5,000,000 founder shares in connection with the Extension (as defined below). 
 The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-252032) for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering” was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 27, 2021. On February 1, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 40,000,000 units, including the issuance of 5,000,000 units as a result of the underwriter’s exercise of its over-allotment option in full, at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit. The gross proceeds from the Initial Public Offering were $400,000,000 in aggregate. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company. Each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of the Company’s Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Only whole warrants are exercisable. 
 Simultaneous with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the Units, the Company consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 6,666,667 private placement warrants at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $10,000,000. 
 A total of $400,000,000 of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by the Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Transaction costs amounted to approximately $22,700,000, of which $14,000,000 was for deferred underwriting fees. 
 The balance of the funds held outside of the trust account are intended to be used primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination. In the future, a portion of interest income on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. At December 31, 2022, funds held in the Trust Account equaled $80,945,242.

 On January 28, 2023, our Units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “TLGA.U.” On March 17, 2021, we announced that the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class A common stock and redeemable warrants included in the Units commencing on March 22, 2021. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of Class A common stock. Any units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “TLGA.U.” Any underlying Class A common stock that are separated will trade on NYSE under the symbol “TLGA.” 
 On November 4, 2022, the NYSE suspended trading in the Public Warrants based on “abnormally low” price levels pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The NYSE delisted the Public Warrants and filed a notification of removal from listing on November 21, 2022. TLG intends to apply to continue the listing of the common stock of New Electriq (as defined below) on the NYSE and list the shares of New Electriq common stock to be issued in connection with the proposed Business Combination and related matters on the NYSE under the proposed symbol “ELIQ” upon the closing of the proposed Business Combination (the “Closing”). 
 PROPOSED BUSINESS COMBINATION 
 On November 13, 2022, the Company and Eagle Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), entered into a Merger Agreement, as amended on December 23, 2022 and as may be further amended (the “Merger Agreement”) with Electriq Power, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Electriq”). If the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Transactions”) are completed, Merger Sub will merge with and into Electriq, with Electriq surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, and upon consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions (together with the Merger, the “Proposed Business Combination”), the separate corporate existence of Electriq will cease to exist and the holders of Electriq common stock, preferred stock, options, warrants and other convertible securities (collectively, the “Electriq equityholders”) will become equityholders of the Company, which will change its name to “Electriq Power Holdings, Inc.” in connection with the Business Combination ( “New Electriq”). 
 As part of the Merger, Electriq equityholders will receive aggregate merger consideration (the “Merger Consideration”) of $495 million, consisting of up to 49,500,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, valued at $10.00 per share, and the right to elect to receive up to $25.0 million in cash with a corresponding reduction in the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. At the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock from the Merger Consideration (the “Merger Consideration Incentive Shares”) will be placed into an escrow account to be used as Merger Consideration Incentive Shares. As part of the Merger Consideration, holders of Electriq’s warrants and options not exercised prior to the Merger will receive replacement warrants and options, respectively, to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock based on the value of the Merger Consideration per share of Electriq common stock. 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to enter into subscription agreements, non-redemption agreements, backstop agreements or similar financing agreements (the “Financing Agreements”) with one or more persons to provide at least the level of cash required to provide adequate operating liquidity for New Electriq through December 31, 2023 (such transactions, the “Financings”). 
 In connection with the Financings, 7,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Incentive Shares”) will be placed in escrow at Closing, consisting of 5,000,000 newly issued shares of The Company’s Class A common stock (the “New Incentive Shares”) and the 2,000,000 Merger Consideration Incentive Shares. The New Incentive Shares will be paid out as incentives in the Financings first, followed by the Merger Consideration Incentive Shares. At the termination of the escrow, any New Incentive Shares not paid out in the Financing will be transferred 50% to the Sponsor (defined in the Merger Agreement) and 50% to the Electriq equityholders, and any Merger Consideration Incentive Shares not paid out in the Financing will be returned to the Electriq equityholders. 
 The Merger Agreement includes covenants of Electriq with respect to operation of its business prior to consummation of the Merger. The Merger Agreement also contains additional covenants of the parties, including, among others, a covenant to make any required filings pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (“HSR”), and the preparation and filing of a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Merger and containing a proxy statement of the Company (the “Registration Statement / Proxy Statement”). The Merger Agreement also contains exclusivity provisions prohibiting Electriq and its subsidiaries from soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating, participating in, entering into, continuing discussions, negotiations or transactions with, or knowingly encouraging or responding to any inquiries or proposals by, or providing any information to any person relating to or that could reasonably be expect to lead to, or enter into or consummate any transaction relating to a Competing Company Transaction (as defined in the Merger Agreement), subject to limited exceptions specified therein. 
 The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties thereto with respect to the parties, the Business Combination contemplated by the Merger Agreement and their respective business operations and activities. The representations and warranties of the parties generally do not survive the Closing.

 Consummation of the Business Combination is generally subject to customary conditions, including (a) expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under HSR, (b) the absence of any law or governmental order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (c) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, (d) the Company’s Class A common stock to be issued in the Merger having been listed on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) upon the Closing, and otherwise satisfying the applicable listing requirements of NYSE, (e) receipt of stockholder approval from stockholders of each of the Company and Electriq for consummation of the Merger and other related necessary matters and (f) the Company having net tangible assets following the redemptions of at least $5,000,001. 
 The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, including by mutual written consent or if the Business Combination has not been consummated on or prior to April 1, 2023 (subject to extensions until as late as June 1, 2023). 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain security holders of Electriq (the “Electriq Holders”) entered into lock-up agreements (each, a “Lock-up Agreement”) with Electriq and the Company. Pursuant to the Lock-up Agreements, the Electriq Holders agreed, among other things, that their shares of the Company’s Class A common stock received as Merger Consideration may not be transferred until the earlier to occur of (i) six months following Closing and (ii) the date after the Closing on which New Electriq completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of New Electriq stockholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in New Electriq for cash, securities or other property (the “Lock-up”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the Closing, (i) the volume weighted average price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period, 10% of the Restricted Securities (as defined in the Lock-up Agreement) of each Electriq Holder is released from the Lock-up and (ii) the volume weighted average price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period, an additional 10% of the Restricted Securities of each Electriq Holder will be released from the Lock-up. 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Sponsor Agreement”) with Electriq, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor and the Company’s independent directors, whereby the Sponsor and holders of the Company’s Class F common stock have agreed to waive certain of their anti-dilution and conversion rights with respect to the Class F common stock. 
 The Sponsor also agreed to subject its holdings of the Company’s Class F common stock, and the other holders of the Company’s Class F common stock agreed to subject their Class F common stock, to certain transfer restrictions as follows: (i) with respect to 500,000 shares of Class F common stock, the Sponsor will not transfer such shares until the earliest to occur of (x) the fifth anniversary of the Closing, (y) such time as the closing volume weighted average price of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period and (z) the date after the Closing on which New Electriq completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of New Electriq stockholders having the right to exchange their the Company’s Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property; (ii) with respect to an additional 500,000 shares of Class F common stock, the Sponsor will not transfer such shares until the earliest to occur of (x) the fifth anniversary of the Closing, (y) such time as the closing volume weighted average price of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period or (z) the date after the Closing on which New Electriq completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of New Electriq stockholders having the right to exchange their the Company’s Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property; and (iii) with respect to all of the shares of Class F common stock (including those covered in (i) and (ii)), the Sponsor and the other holders will not transfer such shares until the earliest to occur of (x) the six-month anniversary of the Closing or (y) the date after the Closing on which New Electriq completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of New Electriq stockholders having the right to exchange their the Company’s Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property; provided that (i) 10% of such shares of Class F common stock will be released at such time as the closing volume weighted average price of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period and (ii) an additional 10% of such shares of Class F common stock will be released at such time as the closing volume weighted average price of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock equals or exceeds $15.00 for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period.

 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of Electriq (each, a “Supporting Electriq Stockholder”), Electriq and the Company entered into a Support Agreement (the “Support Agreement”). Under the Support Agreement, each Supporting Electriq Stockholder agreed to, among other things, (i) vote at any meeting of the stockholders of Electriq or by written consent all of its Electriq common stock and/or Electriq preferred stock, as applicable, held of record or thereafter acquired in favor of the Merger and the Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii) be bound by certain transfer restrictions with respect to Electriq securities, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreement. 
 The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, New Electriq, the Sponsor and certain former Electriq equityholders will enter into a stockholders’ agreement (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”), pursuant to which (i) the Sponsor will be entitled to nominate one (1) director until the date upon which the Sponsor’s and its affiliates’ aggregate initial ownership interest of the issued and outstanding common stock of New Electriq (“Sponsor Initial Ownership Interest”) decreases to one-half of Sponsor Initial Ownership Interest and (ii) Greensoil Building Innovation Fund Co-Investment I, L.P. (“Greensoil”) will be entitled to nominate one (1) director until the date upon which Greensoil’s and its affiliates’ aggregate initial ownership interest of the issued and outstanding common stock of New Electriq (“Greensoil Initial Ownership Interest”) decreases to one-half of the Greensoil Initial Ownership Interest. The Sponsor and Greensoil will also each be entitled to designate one non-voting board observer until the date upon which each of the Sponsor and Greensoil, respectively, holds less than 1% of the issued and outstanding common stock of New Electriq. 
 The Merger Agreement contemplates that, at the Closing, New Electriq, the Sponsor, certain of its affiliates, RBC and certain former stockholders of Electriq will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, New Electriq will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), certain shares of the Company’s Class A common stock that are held by, or issuable pursuant to other securities held by, the parties thereto from time to time. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company or companies that can benefit from our management team’s operational and investment expertise to build long-term shareholder value. We aim to achieve the following: 
 
4 


 Leverage Our Management Team’s Network and the TLG Platform to Source Potential Acquisition Targets 
 Our selection process for an initial business combination target will leverage our management team’s relationship network developed through their success both operating blue-chip public companies and investing in businesses across a variety of industry sectors. In addition, our team aims to leverage TLG’s platform and network of growing relationship with founders, chief executive officers and other executives, venture capitalists, private equity investors, board members, intermediaries, and other industry leaders to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. Our management team believes that our sponsor’s presence in the private equity industry and active participation on boards of companies, results in inbound communication from founders, shareholders, management teams, and investment bankers seeking their advice and soliciting their interest in investment opportunities. 
Capitalize on Our Management Team’s Knowledge of Specific Industries 
 We believe that industry knowledge is essential in identifying high quality investment opportunities. Our management team has operated and invested in multiple public and private companies across several industries, including technology, healthcare, financial services, and business services sectors. We believe that the technology sector and other sectors impacted by technological disruption will produce significant investment opportunities and avenues for long-term value creation. Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe there has been widespread stress on many companies in multiple sectors. We anticipate challenges and the need for restructuring with respect to supply chains, management systems, cost optimization, and financial models, even in sectors that are expected to recover relatively quickly. We therefore anticipate that many more companies will need to formulate a turnaround plan to address these stresses. All these issues create opportunities for investment. Our management team consists of industry veterans who have experience with technological adoption and innovation at multiple organizations and helped companies navigate financial and operating challenges through macroeconomic cycles. 
Employ Decades of Public Company Operational Prowess in Partnering with and Supporting Motivated Executive Teams 
 We intend to closely partner with executives who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate long-term value. We believe that in their capacity as chairpersons and board members of multiple publicly traded companies as well as private companies, our management team has gained hands-on experience supporting business executives with varied experiences. We believe that our management team has demonstrated success in transforming executive teams to realize their full potential as sophisticated leaders of publicly traded entities. 
Apply TLG’s Proprietary Value Creation Model to Drive Long-Term Operational Success 
 Our management team has established reputation for growing platforms in the public markets, driving digital innovation throughout organizations, executing both financial and operating turnarounds, and creating value in complex situations. We evaluate the public and private markets using our research and dialogue with industry participants, entrepreneurs, and business operators to uncover quality private companies as well as spin-out candidates who may benefit from our operating and capital expertise to accelerate growth, navigate a transition or a challenging time in their business. We will look to employ TLG’s proprietary and differentiated Value Creation Model, discussed below, to formulate an appropriate operating plan, which may include benchmarking revenue and revenue enhancement strategies, identifying cost take-out opportunities, establishing margin goals, and assessing risks and priorities. The Value Creation Model consists of five components: (i) “Strategy,” (ii) “Asset Allocation,” (iii) “Financial Model,” (iv) “Management Team,” and (v) “Culture,” which includes “compensation” and “measurement” models. The Strategy element aims to identify how a company is positioned in its industry and whether it has favorable presence in promising subsectors within its industry. The Asset Allocation element looks to assess whether a company has requisite assets and partnerships to execute on its strategy and if there is a need to divest or acquire assets. The Financial Model element focuses on the quality of earnings, transparency of the financial model, and approach to capital allocation. The Management Team element of the Model seeks to ensure if a bench of motivated senior executives is in place to lead the company and if there is a need to adjust or augment the existing 
 
5 


  management team. Finally, the Culture element of the Model assesses if management and compensation systems incentivize driving key performance metrics consistent with business and financial goals and if an open and transparent culture, focused on ethical business practices, exists. 
 Utilize our Management Team’s Track Record of Expanding Platforms via Strategic Combinations 
 We plan to capitalize on our management team’s extensive industry networks to arrange synergistic business combinations, whether consummated simultaneously with or subsequent to a potential platform investment. We aim to identify synergistic combinations that are consistent with the target’s business strategy and will be value-accretive to the platform. 
ACQUISITION CRITERIA 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in our evaluation, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet all of these criteria and guidelines. We generally intend to focus on the following characteristics in our evaluation of potential target businesses: 

• | Size: Companies that alone, or through a strategic combination with another company, have an equity valuation between $500 million to $2.0 billion.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sector: Targets in large, growing markets with favorable end market dynamics such as high fragmentation and secular tailwinds. We may target companies that operate in industries that can potentially benefit from scale and synergies from consolidation. As part of our consideration, we may also target ESG-oriented companies that seek to reduce company and/or societal carbon footprints, such as companies participating in the societal shift away from fossil fuels. We will seek to leverage our management team’s experience in the broader technology, healthcare, business services, and financial services domains to identify potential companies. We will also seek to leverage our management team’s experience in identifying targets that are either disruptors in their space or are faced with technological disruption.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive Differentiation: Acquisition targets that have a unique value proposition and are leaders, visionaries or growing niche players in their respective industries. Demonstrated competitive advantages may include large and sticky customer base, global footprint, significant assets and/or IP, first mover advantage within a sector, or highly skilled labor.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Management Team: Companies with strong management teams with established track records who would further benefit from our network and expertise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial Profile: Businesses that have growing revenue streams, recurring or highly visible revenue models, low levels of leverage, and already have, or have the potential to generate, stable and increasing free cash flow.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value Creation Opportunities: Opportunities that are best positioned to benefit from our management team’s decades of practical experience executing operating turnarounds, helping companies realize their full potential through significantly scaling businesses, strategically repositioning them, and expanding operations to establish a global presence.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination.

 Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience. 
 We currently have a pending Business Combination with Electriq. If our Business Combination with Electriq is not completed, the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team directly or indirectly own shares of our common stock and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 With the exception of Mr. Johnson, our management and our directors may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. In addition, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. We expect that if an opportunity is presented to one of our officers or directors in his or her capacity as an officer or director of one of those other entities, such opportunity would be presented to such other entity and not to us. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if any, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the 
 
7 


  post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 On December 19, 2022, TLG obtained stockholder approval to allow us to extend the time by which we must complete our initial business combination (the “Extension”) on a monthly basis up to six times from February 1, 2023 to August 1, 2023 by depositing into the Trust Account the lesser of (i) an aggregate of $600,000 or (ii) $0.06 for each issued and outstanding public share that has not been redeemed for each one-month Extension. In connection with the approval of the Extension, the holders of 32,051,595 shares of Class A common stock properly exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account. 
 Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets 
 We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
 We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.

 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the Trust Account was approximately $10.18 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers, directors and an affiliate of our sponsor have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. RBC has also agreed not to redeem any such shares of our Class A common stock owned by it for which it has investment control in connection with a stockholder vote for our initial business combination. 
Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will have only until April 1, 2023 (as such period may be extended to August 1, 2023) to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such time period. 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and an affiliate of our sponsor have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 1, 2023 (as such period may be extended to August 1, 2023). However, if our sponsor, officers, directors and such affiliate of our sponsor acquire public shares of our common stock, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to such letter agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by April 1, 2023 (as such period may be extended to August 1, 2023) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). 
 Competition 
 We currently have a pending Business Combination with Electriq. If our Business Combination with Electriq is not completed, in identifying, evaluating and selecting a new target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
