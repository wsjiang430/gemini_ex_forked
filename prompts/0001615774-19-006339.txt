ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 
We are a clinical-stage, pre-revenue, pharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of diseases. Through our acquisition of Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we currently are focusing on a pipeline of small molecule adenosine receptor modulators.
 
The adenosine receptor modulators include A2B antagonists, dual A2A/A2B antagonists, and A2A agonists that have broad development applicability including indications within immuno-oncology and inflammation. Adenosine is implicated in immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Adenosine receptor antagonists may boost the host immune response against the tumor as a single-agent and in combination with other existing immuno-oncology agents leading to enhanced tumor killing and inhibition of metastasis. Adenosine also has anti-inflammatory properties in the acute and chronic setting. Adenosine receptor agonists may promote a decreased inflammatory response and can potentially treat a broad range of inflammatory and autoimmune based diseases and conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, joint injury, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis) as well as improve wound healing and decrease pain.    
 
During February 2018, due to a lack of capital, we curtailed our business operations. In the event that we are able to raise sufficient capital, our major focus would be: (i) further characterization, in conjunction with Ridgeway Therapeutics, of anti-cancer activity of the current pipeline of A2B antagonists and dual A2A/A2B antagonists leading to selection of a clinical candidate for an Investigative New Drug or IND enabling studies, (ii) further characterization of the current pipeline of A2A agonists leading to selection of a clinical candidate for an Investigative New Drug or IND enabling studies; (iii) licensing and/or partnering the A2B antagonists, dual A2A/A2B antagonists, and/or A2A agonists for further development, (iv) through our newly acquired adenosine receptor chemistry technology platform, continue to produce next generation adenosine receptor modulators, (v) pursue licensing and/or partnering of mipsagargin, (vi) conduct a clinical study of mipsagargin in patients with advanced HCC, (vii) explore collaborations utilizing mipsagargin in new, non-clinical solid tumor models with leading researchers in the oncology field and (viii) plan to obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interests.  
 
Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent on the amount and timing of capital, if any, that we are able to raise. During July 2018, we were able to raise approximately $500,000 through the sale of debt securities. We are currently using such funds to attempt to become current in our SEC reporting requirements, pay outstanding invoices to our independent registered accounting firm, and other outstanding obligations directly related to our SEC reporting requirements, the payment of which we believe to be vital to our future operations. Should we fail to further raise sufficient funds to execute our business plan, our priority would be to maintain our intellectual property portfolio and continue, to the best of our ability, our public company reporting requirements.  
 
While we believe that the data from our nonclinical studies appear promising, the outcome of our ongoing or future studies may ultimately be unsuccessful.
 
Pre-Revenue 
 
We are a pre-revenue, early stage company that has not achieved profitability, and has no product revenues. Additionally, we have no approved products for sale.
 
Going Concern
 
Our auditors’ report on our December 31, 2017 financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. During February of 2018, we curtailed our operations due to our lack of cash. Notwithstanding our recent financing in July 2018, whereby we raised $500,000, our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern past the second quarter of 2019. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment.
Recent Developments
 

● | On August 3, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc. to develop A2B antagonists, dual A2A/A2B antagonists, initially as anti-cancer agents. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On July 5, 2018, we completed the private placement of $515,000 of non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures. 
● | Between October 2, 2017 and October 23, 2017, we announced three (3) separate collaborations for preclinical studies of our proprietary adenosine receptor modulator based compounds. The collaborations are with the University of Virginia School of Medicine, NYU Winthrop Hospital, and the National Institutes of Health. 
● | On September 12, 2017, we completed (i) the private placement of approximately $320,000 non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures and (ii) the exchange of approximately $2.5 million in stated value Series A and Series B Preferred stock for non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures.

● | On July 31, 2017, we completed a share exchange agreement whereby we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Lewis & Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in exchange for 7,122,172 shares of our common stock (50% of our issued and outstanding common stock, including common shares issuable upon conversion of our preferred stock). We have subsequently determined that the goodwill assigned to the as Lewis & Clark acquisition had become fully impaired as of December 31, 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On April 24, 2017, April 18, 2017 and March 17, 2017, we completed the private placement of an aggregate of approximately $290,000 of our securities.

Product Development of Mipsagargin
 
Mipsagargin is a prodrug targeting the tumor vasculature that has therapeutic potential in a wide range of malignancies. We have currently curtailed our development of mipsagargin. We can not predict if or when we will recommence development of mipsagargin.
Product Development of Adenosine Receptor Modulators
 
Adenosine is an extracellular signaling molecule that regulates multiple aspects of tissue function and specifically plays a role in immunity and inflammation. High levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment inhibits immune response mediated through the A2A and A2B receptors. Adenosine also plays a role in non-malignant conditions where it is rapidly increased in response to inflammation, hypoxia, ischemia, or trauma. Adenosine released in this setting has been shown to have a protective effect and limits excessive inflammatory damage to tissues.
 
The adenosine receptor antagonists have broad applicability as a potential immuno-oncology (IO) therapeutic agent in multiple tumor types both as a single agent and in combination with other IO agents, in addition to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We are actively seeking licensing opportunities and/or partners to further development our A2B and dual A2A/A2B receptor antagonists. Our current product development plan for adenosine receptor antagonists contemplates the following major initiatives, subject to the Company receiving sufficient funds:
 

● | Continue development of anti-cancer agents with partner company, Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further characterization of existing agents toward IND enabling studies and support ongoing licensing/partnership activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conduct IND enabling studies.
--+------------------------------


● | Conduct clinical studies with one or more of the adenosine receptor antagonists.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue generating additional adenosine receptor antagonists to expand our portfolio.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The adenosine receptor agonists have applicability in a broad range of non-oncology conditions including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and conditions. We are actively seeking licensing opportunities and/or partners to further development our A2A receptor agonists. Our current product development plan for adenosine receptor agonists contemplates the following major initiatives subject to the Company receiving sufficient funds:
 

● | License and/or partner to companies with development expertise in the intended indication.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further characterize existing agents to support licensing/partnership activities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue generating additional adenosine receptor agonists to expand our portfolio.

Our Technology
 
We have what we believe to be a robust intellectual property portfolio covering proprietary A2A agonists (LNC-001, see below), A2B antagonists (LNC-002, see below), and dual A2A/A2B antagonists (LNC-003, see below). We also have a substantial catalog of synthesized compounds, specifically A2A agonists and A2B antagonists that require further characterization and testing for potential clinical candidates. We believe that our proprietary dual A2A/A2B antagonists have great potential and should be further explored.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable or that we determine to keep as trade secrets. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, significant scientific collaborators, and sponsored researchers that generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property.
 
The intellectual property underlying our technology is covered by certain patents and patent applications previously owned by Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LNC) and now fully owned by the Company. All of the LNC intellectual property has been assigned to LNC, a fully owned subsidiary of the Company.

When appropriate, we will continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe will provide us with a competitive advantage. We will accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States and, for LNC-003, in the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). In addition, we plan to obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.

Development Strategy 
 
While we curtailed our operations in February 2018 due to our cash position, in the event that we are able to raise sufficient capital to execute our clinical and pre-clinical development strategy, we anticipate that under the planning and direction of key personnel, we expect to outsource all our nonclinical development and manufacturing, and the majority of our clinical development activities to contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Our contract CROs and CMOs are required to comply with federal, state and United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA regulations including Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Lab Practices (GLP).
 
In the event that we are able to raise sufficient capital, we intend to conduct further characterization and testing of our A2B antagonists to select a candidate for pre-clinical and clinical trials in an oncology indication. This oncology work is expected to be run in conjunction with and oversight from Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc. for the selection of an anti-cancer agent. Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc. is currently delinquent in their quarterly payments. We expect them to fulfill their obligations once they have funding.
 
In-licensing or Acquisition Strategy.
 
In addition to the development of our current product candidates, we have initiated an in-licensing or acquisition strategy to further expand our product pipeline. Our in-licensing strategy consists of evaluating early clinical or late preclinical stage opportunities in therapeutic areas that can benefit from our current product candidates or core expertise in drug development. We believe that this element of our corporate strategy could diversify some of the risks inherent in focusing on limited therapeutic areas and could increase our probability of commercial success.
Commercialization Strategy
 
In the event that we are able to raise sufficient capital to continue our operations, we intend to (i) license or sell the underlying technology of our therapeutics to third parties during or after our clinical trials, (ii) seek a corporate partner for further development, or (iii) continue developing our drug candidates ourselves. It is expected that such third parties would then continue to develop, market, sell, and distribute any resulting products. As part of our overall strategic plan, we are exploring our options and actively seeking to engage in a collaborative, strategic and/or licensing arrangement with another pharmaceutical company. If we enter into any such transaction, we may be required to give up certain rights to our technology and control over its future development.
Intellectual Property 
 
We regard the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive position. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on patent, trade secret, and copyright law, as well as confidentiality, nondisclosure, assignment of invention and other contractual arrangements with our officers, directors, employees, consultants, investigators, clinical trial sites, contractors, collaborators and other third parties to whom we disclose confidential information. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of our business. We solely own or have exclusive licenses to our patents and patent applications.
 
Our pipeline currently includes a substantial catalog of synthesized compounds, specifically A2A agonists and A2B antagonists that require further characterization and testing for potential clinical candidates. Our proprietary dual A2A/A2B antagonists have great potential and need to be further explored.
 
Our intellectual property estate, shown above, has eight (8) issued patents in six (6) different jurisdictions and twenty-one (21) currently pending applications. With appropriate funding and upon further research into our dual A2A/A2B antagonists, we intend to file a regular US and a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications to enable worldwide protection of these antagonists.
 
When appropriate and funding permitting, we plan to continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe would provide us with a competitive advantage. We expect to be able to accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States as well as foreign countries, where applicable. In addition, we may obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest. 
 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 
We do not plan to develop company-owned or company-operated manufacturing facilities. We outsource all drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers that are required to operate in compliance with cGMP. We may also seek to refine the current manufacturing process in order to achieve improvements in efficiency, costs, purity and the like as well as address different drug formulations to achieve improvements in stability and/or drug delivery.

Governmental Regulations
 
FDA Approval Process
 
Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety, tolerability and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. (In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial.) In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process.
 
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non-biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may grant marketing approval, may request additional information, may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval, and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review. There can be no assurance that approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.  
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
European and Other Regulatory Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.     Reimbursement and Health Care Cost Control
 
Reimbursement for the costs of treatments and products such as ours from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and others, both in the United States and abroad, is a key element in the success of new health care products. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. The revenue and profitability of some health care-related companies have been affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. Payors are increasingly attempting to limit both coverage and the levels of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the FDA, and are refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control.
 
8


In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over health care costs. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordance Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law in March 2010. A number of provisions of those laws require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. The laws also include new authorization to the FDA to approve companies to market biosimilar products within the United States, although to date FDA rulemaking under this legislation has been limited. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any such future rulemaking on our business.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. Additionally, we are subject to regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.    Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017 we employed 7 full-time individuals. As of April 1, 2019, Mr. Lowe, our chief executive officer, is our only remaining employee. In addition, we contract with a limited number of consultants to assist in activities related to our operations.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2003 and our principal office is located in Westlake Village, California. On November 17, 2016, we completed a 1:30 reverse stock split of our common stock. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of mipsagargin (G-202). As of February 2018, we have curtailed our operations due to our cash position. In the event that we receive sufficient funding, we plan to focus our efforts on our Adenosine Receptor Modulators. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our product candidates and have experienced substantial net operating losses.
