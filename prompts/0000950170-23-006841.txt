 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients with genetically defined rare diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. Our most advanced clinical product candidate, losmapimod, is being developed for the potential treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD. Our other clinical product candidate is FTX-6058, which is being developed for the potential treatment of certain hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease, or SCD. We initiated REACH, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of losmapimod in the second quarter of 2022 and plan to complete enrollment in the second half of 2023. In January 2023, we announced Phase 1b data from our clinical trial of FTX-6058 in SCD. We have completed enrollment in the 6 mg and 2 mg dose cohorts, and we do not plan to enroll additional subjects in these cohorts. Although we commenced enrollment in the 12 mg dose cohort, on February 23, 2023, the FDA placed a full clinical hold on the IND for FTX-6058 for SCD. We have suspended enrollment and dosing in the Phase 1b trial of FTX-6058, withdrew our separate IND for FTX-6058 for beta thalassemia and intend to work diligently with FDA to resolve the hold as soon as possible.
 We have developed a proprietary product engine, FulcrumSeek, that we employ to systematically identify and validate cellular drug targets that can potentially modulate gene expression to treat known root causes of genetically defined diseases. Our product engine integrates patient-derived tissue and disease-relevant cell models that we interrogate using our pharmacologically diverse and highly annotated small-molecule compound library and customized CRISPR and RNAi libraries. These screens generate tens of millions of data points and high-content imaging. We then apply computational biology and analytics to identify targets with specificity and selectivity accompanied by a comprehensive data set that significantly accelerates development. This approach led to the identification of both losmapimod for FSHD and FTX-6058 for hemoglobinopathies, as well as a robust discovery pipeline.
Our most advanced product candidate, losmapimod, is a small molecule that we in-licensed from affiliates of GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK, and are developing for the treatment of FSHD, a rare, progressive and disabling disorder characterized by muscle degeneration and fat infiltration. Disease progression results in the accumulation of disability with many patients ultimately becoming dependent on wheelchairs and losing independence as their ability to perform activities of daily living decreases. Losmapimod selectively targets p38α/ß mitogen activated protein kinase, or p38α/ß. We utilized our product engine to discover that inhibition of p38α/ß reduced expression of the DUX4 gene in muscle cells derived from patients with FSHD. The aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene is the known root cause of FSHD. There are no approved therapies for FSHD, one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy, with an estimated patient population of 16,000 to 38,000 in the United States and 300,000 to 780,000 globally. Losmapimod has received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of FSHD, and in May 2021, received fast track designation from the FDA.
 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international Phase 2b clinical trial, referred to as ReDUX4, to evaluate losmapimod in 80 patients with FSHD. In this Phase 2b clinical trial, the primary endpoint was change in DUX4-driven gene expression, an experimental molecular biomarker. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, in blood, as well as measures of muscle health, structure and function, including muscle fat infiltration, or MFI, reachable workspace, or RWS, and patient-reported outcomes. Concurrently, we initiated a single-center open label Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of chronic treatment with losmapimod in patients with FSHD. In the ongoing extension of the open label trial, we are also evaluating measures of muscle function, muscle strength, and patient reported quality of life.
We presented data through 48 weeks from the ReDUX4 trial in June 2021. While the primary endpoint was not met, results demonstrated clinically relevant benefits versus placebo on multiple measures of muscle health and function as well as patient reported outcomes at 48 weeks. Losmapimod-treated participants showed decreased progression of MFI as measured in intermediate muscles, which are muscles already affected by disease and most likely to show signs of disease progression. Normal appearing muscles appeared to be preserved in the losmapimod group versus placebo. Treatment with losmapimod was shown to slow the rate of decline and improve accessible surface area in RWS, which is a measure of function that assesses upper extremity range of motion and has been shown to be an important measure of independence. Additionally, patients reported feeling better when treated with losmapimod compared to placebo through the Patient Global Impression of Change, or PGIC, assessment. PGIC is a measure of self-reported change in how a patient feels and functions. Losmapimod was generally well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events reported.

Based on the ReDUX4 data, we engaged with U.S. and EU regulatory agencies, including FDA, and gained alignment on key aspects of the design of a Phase 3 trial. We initiated our Phase 3 trial, REACH, in the second quarter of 2022 and plan to complete enrollment in the second half of 2023. REACH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 230 adults with FSHD. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive either losmapimod, administered orally as a 15 mg tablet twice a day, or placebo, and are evaluated over a 48 week treatment period. The primary endpoint of the study is the absolute change from baseline in RWS. Secondary endpoints include MFI, PGIC, and Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders of the upper extremity, or Neuro QoL UE. The trial also includes patient-centered assessments of healthcare utilization.
In October 2022, we presented data through 96 weeks from the open label extension portion of ReDUX4. Data presented showed that patients in the initial treatment arm who continued to receive losmapimod experienced maintenance of effect through 96-weeks as measured by RWS mean change from baseline. Additionally, patients who crossed over from placebo to losmapimod after the initial 48-week trial period showed improvement and slowing of disease progression as measured by RWS mean change from baseline. Losmapimod continued to demonstrate an encouraging safety profile and continued to be generally well-tolerated.
 Our other product candidate, FTX-6058, is an investigational oral fetal hemoglobin, or HbF, inducer that is in development for the potential treatment of SCD and other certain hemoglobinopathies. FTX-6058 is designed to bind to embryonic ectoderm development, or EED, and inhibit the transcriptional silencing activity of the polycomb repressive complex 2, or PRC2. Inhibition of EED leads to potent downregulation of key fetal globin repressors, including BCL11A, thereby causing an increase in HbF. EED is a member of the PRC2 complex, which also includes EZH2. There are approved products in the EZH2 class of medications and their approved labeling outlines safety risks, including an increased risk of malignancies.
SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a mutation in the ß-subunit gene, or HBB gene. This mutation results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin, or HbS, which causes red blood cells, or RBCs, to change from a round shape into a sickle shape that significantly impairs their function. We designed FTX-6058 to compensate for the root cause of these hemoglobinopathies by inducing the expression of the two γ-globin genes, HBG1/2, whose expression is normally silenced shortly after birth. The HBG1/2 genes encode for γ-globin, a component of HbF, which is known to repair the abnormal RBC shape in SCD and to compensate for the presence of HbS in SCD. We have observed in vitro and in vivo activation of the HBG1/2 genes in preclinical studies with FTX-6058. We have also observed that FTX-6058 demonstrated robust levels of HbF elevation with no adverse effects on important cellular health markers. We conducted additional pre-clinical profiling in CD34+ derived cells and observed that treatment with FTX-6058 increased HbF levels to approximately 30% of total hemoglobin, as measured by mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography techniques. The elevation of HbF was significantly greater than we observed with hydroxyurea in the cell models.
Our Phase 1b trial of FTX-6058 in subjects with SCD (both on and off hydroxyurea) is currently subject to a full clinical hold. Although in January 2023 we announced data from subjects with SCD receiving 6 mg of FTX-6058, as well as completion of enrollment in the 6 mg and 2 mg dose cohorts and commencement of enrollment in the 12 mg dose cohort, in February 2023 FDA placed a full clinical hold on the IND for FTX-6058 for SCD. Accordingly, we have suspended enrollment and dosing in the Phase 1b trial of FTX-6058 and intend to work diligently with FDA to resolve the hold as soon as possible.
Phase 1b data from evaluable subjects as of the December 21, 2022 data cutoff in the 6 mg dose cohort (n=10) showed up to 9.5% absolute HbF increases from baseline; data suggested no difference in response in subjects on (n=3) and off (n=7) background hydroxyurea. We also observed improved biomarkers of hemolysis in evaluable subjects dosed at 6 mg. The figures below illustrate percentage HbF increase by HPLC and absolute percentage HbF change from baseline for evaluable subjects (n=7) in the 6 mg dose cohort (subjects with asterisks were on hydroxyurea).



We have completed enrollment in the 6 mg and 2 mg dose cohorts, and we do not plan to enroll additional subjects in these cohorts, or in any other cohorts until such time as we are able to resolve the clinical hold. Data from subjects in the 2 mg dose cohort (n=2), showed up to 4.6% absolute HbF increases from baseline.
 


Enrollment and dosing in the 12 mg dose cohort (including subjects both on and off hydroxyurea) are currently suspended as the Phase 1b trial is on clinical hold. Data from subjects in the 12 mg dose cohort (n=3), prior to the suspension of the trial, showed up to 10.0% absolute HbF increases from baseline after 42 days of treatment. Subjects with asterisks were on hydroxyurea.



Increases in HbF have been shown to reduce the frequency or severity of a broad range of SCD symptoms, including vaso-occlusive crises, or VOC, anemia, pain, infection, stroke and others. Based on a large body of genetic, clinical, and observational evidence showing the effects of higher levels of HbF in people with SCD, the induction of HbF by 5-10% over baseline could be associated with reduced disease burden and improved clinical outcomes. We believe these initial data showing that FTX-6058 increased HbF levels by up to 9.5% support its potential to become a transformative therapy for people living with SCD, if approved.
 FTX-6058 has been generally well-tolerated as of the March 3, 2023 data cutoff date. There have been 14 treatment emergent adverse effects, or TEAEs, reported to date, two of which were reported as possibly related to study drug (headache, lip numbness), neither of which were severe and were deemed non-serious. There have been no discontinuations due to TEAEs. Three of the 14 TEAEs were characterized as VOCs, and were deemed unrelated to FTX-6058, one of which was reported as a serious adverse event, or SAE, with acute chest syndrome in a non-adherent subject.
In December 2022, we received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for FTX-6058 for the treatment of SCD.
According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, there are approximately 7,000 rare, genetically defined human diseases, many of which have inadequate or no approved treatments. Our current drug target identification and development efforts are focused on rare muscular, hematologic and neurologic, disorders. We also anticipate utilizing FulcrumSeek to discover drug targets for genetically defined diseases in other therapeutic areas and for other disorders. In addition to drug targets that we prioritize for internal development, we may identify other drug targets that we would consider for development through partnerships. For example, we are utilizing FulcrumSeek to discover drug targets for the potential treatment of certain genetically defined cardiomyopathies under our collaboration and license agreement with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.


Our Pipeline
Using FulcrumSeek, we have generated a pipeline of potentially disease-modifying therapies that address the known root cause of rare genetic diseases. The following chart summarizes key information about our pipeline of clinical stage and pre-clinical programs.
   Our Strategy
We are leveraging the broad applicability of our proprietary product engine to discover and develop small molecule therapies that modulate gene expression to address the known root cause of genetically defined rare diseases in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe that our initial product candidates for the treatment of FSHD and SCD may have the potential to treat patients with these debilitating and, in some cases, life-threatening illnesses. The key components of our strategy include:
 •Rapidly develop losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. We aim to rapidly develop losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD through clinical development and regulatory approval. In the second quarter of 2022, we initiated REACH, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD and plan to complete enrollment in the second half of 2023. 
 •Rapidly develop FTX-6058 for the treatment of SCD. We aim to rapidly complete the clinical development of FTX-6058 for the treatment of SCD to support regulatory approval and intend to work diligently with FDA to resolve the full clinical hold imposed on February 23, 2023. Although we commenced enrollment in the 12 mg dose cohort in a Phase 1b clinical trial of FTX-6058 in subjects with SCD, dosing and enrollment in this trial are currently on hold.
 •Continue to apply FulcrumSeek to grow our portfolio of product candidates for the treatment of genetically defined diseases. We have developed a rigorous assessment and selection process to determine which of the approximately 7,000 rare, genetically defined diseases we intend to evaluate in drug target identification activities. We are applying FulcrumSeek to discover drug targets to modulate gene expression and develop product candidates for the potential treatment of the root cause of disease.
 •Further expand our product engine capabilities. We have significantly enhanced the scale and power of FulcrumSeek to increase the pace of discovery and we intend to further expand our capabilities to enhance the therapeutic reach and productivity of our drug discovery process. 


•Maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. We have retained all rights to our lead product candidates focused on rare genetically defined diseases, and plan to commercialize any approved product for such rare genetically defined diseases using a targeted sales infrastructure. We may in the future pursue commercialization partnerships for certain product candidates and/or markets outside the United States. 
 •Selectively enter into strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our product engine and pipeline. Given the breadth of opportunities for our proprietary product engine to discover drug targets and develop product candidates for genetically defined diseases, we may enter into strategic partnerships for certain drug targets, product candidates or disease areas, such as our collaboration and license agreement with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb. Partnerships may provide an attractive avenue for expanding the impact of our proprietary product engine. 
 Our Lead Product Candidates
We have used our proprietary product engine and screening efforts to identify drug targets for our lead product candidates. We have two product candidates in clinical trials. The following chart summarizes key information about these lead product candidates.
Losmapimod
Overview of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is a rare, progressive and disabling disease for which there are no approved treatments. FSHD is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy and affects both sexes equally, with onset typically in teens and young adults. FSHD is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle loss that initially causes weakness in muscles in the face, shoulders, arms and trunk and progresses to weakness in muscles in lower extremities and the pelvic girdle. Skeletal muscle weakness results in significant physical limitations, including progressive loss of independence, including impacts to facial muscles that can cause problems with communication, difficulty using arms for activities of daily living and difficulty getting out of bed, with many patients ultimately becoming dependent upon the use of a wheelchair for daily mobility activities. The majority of patients with FSHD also report experiencing chronic pain, anxiety and depression. The diagnosis and treatment of patients with FSHD is typically performed by neurologists.
The FSH Society estimated that the prevalence of FSHD in the United States is approximately 1 in 20,000 people. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands reported a more frequent prevalence of 1 in 8,333. Based on these estimates and a U.S. population of 320 million, we estimate that the patient population is between 16,000 to 38,000 in the United States. We believe that there may be additional patients who are not formally diagnosed due to a perceived difficulty of obtaining a diagnosis and the fact that there are no approved treatments. Approximately two-thirds of cases are familial-inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and one-third of cases are sporadic. FSHD affects all ethnic groups with similar incidence and prevalence.
There are no approved therapies for the treatment of FSHD. Current treatment is limited to symptomatic management including physical/ occupational therapy, low-intensity aerobic exercise tailored to the patient’s distribution of weakness, and general pain management, which may provide limited beneficial effect. Limited range of motion in the shoulder girdle can stem from periscapular muscle weakness leading to scapular winging and in such cases, surgical scapular fixation can result in some functional improvement for certain patients.
Losmapimod could face competition from other therapeutic approaches in development for patients with FSHD. Roche is evaluating RO7204239, a myostatin inhibitor, in a Phase 2 trial in adults with FSHD. Avidity is evaluating AOC 1020, an siRNA antibody-oligonucleotide complex, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in adults with FSHD. We are not aware of any product candidate currently in clinical development for FSHD with the same mechanism of action as losmapimod.


FSHD Biology
FSHD is caused by aberrant expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle resulting in the inappropriate presence of DUX4 protein, a transcription factor causing the expression of other genes. Normally DUX4-driven gene expression is limited to early embryonic development, after which time the DUX4 gene is silenced. In patients with FSHD, aberrant production of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle regulates other genes encoding proteins, some of which are toxic to the muscle. The result of aberrant DUX4 expression in FSHD is death of muscle and its replacement by fat, resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and progressive disability. We believe that reducing expression of the DUX4 gene and its downstream transcriptional program could provide a disease-modifying therapeutic approach for the treatment of FSHD at its root cause. Published preclinical and human data, in addition to in vitro experiments that we have conducted, suggest that any reduction in DUX4 expression may be beneficial for patients. In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that there is a direct relationship between muscle cell death (apoptosis) and the level of DUX4 expression, and a reduction in DUX4 leads to a concomitant decrease in apoptosis. As illustrated in the graphic below, in animal models where expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle is induced, a corresponding loss of function is observed with increasing levels of DUX4 expression. In these animal models where low levels of DUX4 are expressed, the animals performed similarly to healthy animals in a mobility assessment, suggesting that complete DUX4 reduction is not required for a functional benefit. Data from human muscle biopsies likewise indicated that increased DUX4 activity is related to worsening muscle pathology.
 


In all patients with FSHD, the DUX4 gene is unsilenced, or de-repressed, as a result of one of two different types of genetic alterations, leading to FSHD1 or FSHD2. Approximately 95% of patients have FSHD1 and approximately 5% of patients have FSHD2. FSHD1 is caused by the contraction of an array of DNA, known as a D4Z4 repeat, from greater than ten repeat units to nine or fewer units. This contraction causes de-repression of DUX4. Patients with FSHD2 do not have meaningful D4Z4 repeat contraction, but have mutations in a regulatory gene, known as the SMCHD1 gene, that normally contributes to the repression of the DUX4 gene via DNA methylation.

FulcrumSeek Identified the Drug Target for FSHD
We utilized patient-derived FSHD1 muscle cells, known as myotubes, and screened them with our small molecule probe library to identify drug targets that reduced DUX4 expression. We identified several potential drug targets, however the modulation of the majority of the targets adversely affected the health or differentiation of muscle cells. One drug target that we identified from our screening efforts for which we did not observe adverse cell health issues was p38α/ß, which had been studied extensively in other diseases, but had not been reported to be linked to DUX4 expression or FSHD until we conducted our screening efforts. We evaluated multiple small molecule p38α/ß inhibitors and observed a consistent reduction of both DUX4 expression and DUX4-driven gene transcripts with each p38α/ß inhibitor. We conducted further validation experiments to confirm that inhibition of p38α using genetic approaches such as siRNA and CRISPR single-guide RNAs, also led to a reduction in DUX4 expression. Additionally, researchers from Saint Louis University independently published the results of a study which concluded that inhibitors of p38α/ß, including losmapimod, suppressed DUX4 expression in cellular and animal FSHD models.
 Losmapimod Overview
 After identifying p38α/ß as a potential drug target, we evaluated multiple small molecule inhibitors of p38α/ß. Each of these inhibitors had previously been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of various diseases but never in muscle disorders. As a result of our evaluation and relative to other p38α/ß inhibitors, we identified losmapimod as the preferred development candidate based on substantial and attractive preclinical and clinical data regarding safety, PK and target

inhibition, and its advanced stage of development. Losmapimod was originally evaluated by GSK in nearly 3,500 subjects in clinical trials across multiple indications and in multiple countries. GSK did not evaluate losmapimod in FSHD or in any other muscle disorder. Although GSK did not pursue regulatory approval in the indications evaluated, losmapimod demonstrated an attractive PK, PD, safety and tolerability profile, including in chronic dosing. Additionally, we observed in preclinical studies using losmapimod that inhibition of the p38α/ß pathway reduced DUX4 expression and downstream gene expression. After identifying losmapimod, we in-licensed the molecule from GSK because we believed that its safety and pharmacology history would significantly expedite our development plan and enhance our future regulatory submissions.
In June 2021, we reported full data from the randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter international Phase 2b clinical trial, or ReDUX4. Although the primary endpoint was not met, we demonstrated slowing of disease progression and improved function in FSHD patients treated with losmapimod compared to placebo. In October 2022, we presented data through 96 weeks from the open label extension portion of ReDUX4, which showed that patients in the initial treatment-arm who continued to receive losmapimod experienced maintenance of effect through 96 weeks as measured by RWS mean change from baseline. Additionally, patients who crossed over from placebo to losmapimod after the initial 48 week trial period showed improvement and slowing of disease progression as measured by RWS mean change from baseline.
In the second quarter of 2022, we initiated REACH, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD and plan to complete enrollment in the second half of 2023.
 In January 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. In March 2020, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. In May 2021, the FDA granted fast track designation to losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD.
 Clinical Trial: Phase 2b (ReDUX4)
 In June 2021, at the FSHD International Research Congress, we presented full data from our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter international Phase 2b clinical trial, the ReDUX4 trial, in 80 patients with FSHD1 and clinical severity scores of two to four on the Ricci scale. In this trial, we evaluated treatment with 15 mg of losmapimod or placebo tablets twice per day over a 24 or 48-week period. Enrollment was completed in February 2020. Patients were randomized 1:1 between the treatment and placebo arms. The FDA accepted the IND for losmapimod in June 2019, and we also submitted CTAs at various dates during 2019 to conduct the trial at sites in Europe and Canada, all of which were accepted. We presented data from a pre-specified interim analysis in August 2020. We completed the ReDUX4 trial in January 2021 and presented full data from the trial at the FSHD International Research Congress on June 24, 2021.
The primary endpoint was the change in DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle at 16 or 36 weeks, which was included as an experimental biomarker. The trial was also designed to capture a wide range of data relating to FSHD progression in addition to safety, target engagement and PK data. The secondary endpoints were evaluation of safety and tolerability in FSHD patients, PK in blood, losmapimod concentration in skeletal muscle biopsies, target engagement in blood and in muscle biopsies, and efficacy based on the whole-body skeletal muscle MRI biomarker. The whole-body MRI scans evaluated changes in MFI , muscle fat fraction and lean muscle volume. The muscles evaluated in the trial were classified as normal appearing (not affected by disease), intermediate (clearly affected by disease but not so severely fat replaced to have lost all function) or end stage (severely fat replaced and have lost most if not all function). The exploratory endpoints included RWS, timed up and go, or TUG test, an optimized timed up and go test for FSHD, or FSHD TUG, muscle strength measured by hand-held dynamometry, other muscle function measures and patient reported outcomes.
 The original design of ReDUX4 included a muscle biopsy at week 16 during the 24-week treatment period followed by an open label extension. Sixteen of the 80 subjects in trial completed the 24-week treatment period and rolled over to the open label extension portion of the trial. As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we extended the ReDUX4 treatment period from 24 to 48 weeks through a protocol amendment to ensure the safety of the subjects and to allow for the opportunity for a biopsy at week 16 as originally intended or at week 36. Approximately 64 subjects who did not complete the original 24-week treatment period continued in the 48-week treatment period in the randomized portion of the trial. The extension from 24 to 48 weeks also allowed for a longer assessment in a placebo-controlled design of the skeletal muscle MRI secondary endpoint and the various exploratory clinical endpoints, such as RWS, optimized FSHD TUG test, muscle function measures and patient reported outcomes.
In August 2020, we announced results from a pre-specified interim analysis of the primary endpoint of the ReDUX4 trial, which is the reduction from baseline of DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle after subjects have been treated with losmapimod or placebo. Secondary and exploratory endpoints were not assessed as part of this analysis. Results from the interim analysis in the first 29 randomized subjects indicate that DUX4-driven gene expression did not show a separation from placebo at 16 weeks. However, in a pre-specified sensitivity analysis, those with the highest pre-treatment

DUX4-driven gene expression in their muscle biopsy sample showed a large reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression following treatment with losmapimod compared to placebo. The highest expressing muscle biopsies represent the top quartile of biopsies assessed based on baseline DUX4-driven gene expression.
The interim results included an analysis of the first 29 subjects who completed their 16-week biopsy. PK, demographics and the primary endpoint were assessed. The interim analysis was not powered for statistical significance and did not include individual patient level data. Subjects were randomized to receive an oral dose of losmapimod 15mg (n=15) or placebo (n=14) twice per day. While results showed a significant reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression in the muscle biopsies of subjects whose baseline biopsy showed the highest levels of DUX4 gene expression (38-fold decrease with losmapimod, n=3, and 5.4 fold-decrease with placebo, n=5), the population level data analysis of the reduction in DUX4-driven gene expression from all 29 subjects did not show a separation of losmapimod from placebo (3.7 fold increase with losmapimod, n=15, and 2.8 fold increase with placebo, n=14). Results suggested that muscle biopsies within the higher range of DUX4-driven gene expression at baseline may be needed to observe a reduction.
In June 2021, we reported full results from ReDUX4. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint, change from baseline in DUX4-driven gene expression in affected skeletal muscle at Week 16 or Week 36. Secondary and exploratory endpoints showed clinically relevant and nominally statistically significant benefits in the losmapimod treated group versus placebo on multiple measures of structural and functional FSHD progression and patient reported outcomes at 48 weeks. As the primary endpoint was not met, all comparative analyses are reported with nominal statistical p-values.
 •Losmapimod-treated participants showed decreased progression in the treatment efficacy composite measure of MFI as measured in intermediate muscles, those most likely to change (p=0.01). Normal appearing muscles appeared to be preserved in the losmapimod group versus placebo based on a post hoc analysis. MFI is a measure of diffuse fatty infiltration in lean muscle tissue that is correlated with disease severity in FSHD. 
 •Treatment with losmapimod was shown to slow the rate of decline and improve accessible surface area in RWS measures (p<0.05). RWS is a measure of function that assesses upper extremity range of motion. Prior studies have shown that RWS correlates with changes in the ability of patients to independently perform activities of daily living. Based on published results, RWS is an important measure of independence. The disease tends to progress from the upper body down, and loss of shoulder movement leads to loss of mobility. Participants in the losmapimod group showed improvements of up to 1.5 points from baseline in the accessible surface area when using a 500g weight on their wrist compared to placebo. Participants in the placebo group were able to access 2 to 4 points less total surface area (with and without 500g weights) measured by RWS after 48 weeks. The net difference between the groups at 48 weeks was 3.5 to 5 points, which in some patients is the difference between functional independence and dependence.
 •Participants reported feeling better when treated with losmapimod compared to placebo through the PGIC assessment (p=0.02). PGIC, a measure of self-reported change in how a patient feels and functions, showed that participants were able to recognize improvements after 48 weeks of treatment. More participants in the losmapimod group reported improvement at 48 weeks compared to placebo. Four times more losmapimod participants reported improvement over time as compared to participants treated with placebo. Importantly, fewer losmapimod participants reported worsening as compared to placebo, and no losmapimod participants reported being “much worse” as compared to more than 13% of placebo participants, who reported that their disease had become “much worse.”
 Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints measuring disease progression and function demonstrated differences between losmapimod and placebo at week 48. In a post hoc analysis, dynamometry, which measures muscle strength, demonstrated that participants in the losmapimod group showed non-statistically significant trends of slower progression, as well as meaningful improvements (12-27%) in the strength of bilateral shoulder abductors and ankle dorsiflexors, two muscle groups particularly affected in FSHD, compared to placebo. Functional scales including RWS and TUG showed improvements in limb function consistent with dynamometry results. Two recently designed scales (FSHD TUG, and FSHD Health Index), did not demonstrate changes from baseline in either group or differences between losmapimod and placebo groups, suggesting that these tests are not sensitive to change over the 48-week time period. Motor function measure also showed no changes in either group or differences between the groups over 48 weeks. There was no difference in muscle fat fraction or lean muscle volume between losmapimod and placebo groups at 48 weeks in intermediate muscles.
Safety and tolerability data were consistent with previously reported results with no drug-related SAEs reported. Losmapimod was generally well-tolerated and the majority of TEAEs were deemed unlikely related or not related to study drug by the investigator. There were three SAEs (post-op wound infection, alcohol poisoning and a suicide attempt) reported in two participants in the losmapimod group, each assessed as unrelated to losmapimod. There were no deaths or

discontinuations due to adverse events. Losmapimod has now been evaluated in over 3,600 subjects in clinical trials across multiple indications, including FSHD.
REACH, a Phase 3 Registrational Trial
 We initiated REACH, a Phase 3 trial of losmapimod in FSHD, in the second quarter of 2022 and plan to complete enrollment in the second half of 2023. Based on data from the ReDUX4 Phase 2b study, we engaged with U.S. and EU regulatory agencies, including the FDA, and gained alignment on key aspects of the design of a Phase 3 trial intended to support a full registration approval. REACH is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of losmapimod for the treatment of FSHD. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 230 adults with FSHD. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either losmapimod, administered orally as a 15 mg tablet twice a day, or placebo, and evaluated over a 48-week treatment period. The primary endpoint of the study is the absolute change from baseline in RWS. Secondary endpoints include MFI, PGIC, and Neuro QoL UE. The trial will also include patient-centered assessments of healthcare utilization.
Clinical Trial: ReDUX4 Open Label Extension
 In February 2020 we initiated an open label extension of the ReDUX4 trial to enable patients who have completed the 24-week or 48-week treatment period with losmapimod or placebo in ReDUX4 to receive long term treatment with losmapimod. This open label extension includes clinical assessments of safety and efficacy every three months, whole-body musculoskeletal MRI every six months, and a muscle needle biopsy once after six months of treatment over the first 96 weeks. Subsequent to week 96, patients will only be monitored for safety and tolerability. We anticipate that this trial will continue until such time as the drug is approved and available in the commercial setting or the clinical development of losmapimod in FSHD is terminated.
In October 2022, we presented data through 96 weeks from the open label extension portion of ReDUX4. Data presented showed that patients in the initial treatment-arm who continued to receive losmapimod experienced maintenance of effect through 96 weeks as measured by RWS mean change from baseline. Additionally, patients who crossed over from placebo to losmapimod after the initial 48-week trial period showed improvement and slowing of disease progression as measured by RWS mean change from baseline. Losmapimod continued to demonstrate an encouraging safety profile and was generally well tolerated. 97% of participants in the initial 48 week study remained in the open label extension at week 96. The figures below illustrate percentage change in dominant and non-dominant reachable surface area, or RSA, with 500 gram weights.
Clinical Trial: Phase 2 Open Label Study Trial
 In parallel with the ReDUX4 Phase 2b clinical trial, we also initiated in August 2019 an open label, single center Phase 2 clinical trial of losmapimod in up to 16 patients with FSHD and clinical severity scores of two to four on the Ricci scale. In the first part of the trial, patients received tablets containing 15 mg of losmapimod twice per day for up to 52 weeks. The treatment period was preceded by eight weeks of pre-treatment assessments to establish a baseline for musculoskeletal MRI biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments. We also performed an outpatient mobility assessment using wearable sensors. After the 52-week treatment period, participants had the option to elect to continue in an extension of the study, which is ongoing. We are conducting the trial at a single center in the Netherlands.
 The primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of losmapimod for chronic dosing in FSHD patients. The primary endpoints are to assess safety and tolerability over the 52-week period. The secondary endpoints are the change

from baseline in pHSP27 and the ratio of pHSP27 to total HSP27 in blood and muscle for assessment of the inhibition of p38α/ß during the dosing period. This trial is also designed to provide initial data regarding changes in DUX4-driven gene expression, MRI biomarkers, objective clinical outcome assessments and patient-reported outcomes that may occur at various times following initiation of treatment with losmapimod relative to the pre-treatment period. We intend to use this data to further guide our clinical development strategy for losmapimod in FSHD.
 In the 52-week treatment period, we measured DUX4-driven gene expression before and during treatment using muscle needle biopsies in affected muscles. All patients had a pre-treatment biopsy and we will obtain a second muscle needle biopsy from each patient after four or eight weeks of treatment. The original trial design included an additional biopsy during chronic treatment at week 48, but we have removed this assessment from the trial protocol because the open label extension of ReDUX4 includes a biopsy during chronic treatment.
 We measure potential losmapimod treatment effects on shoulder and upper arm function and mobility/ambulation, as well as on muscle strength and function and quality of life and activities of daily living, similar to the assessments in the Phase 2b clinical trial. The clinical outcome assessments are RWS, FSHD-TUG, muscle strength, motor function ability and generic and FSHD-specific patient reports of quality of life and activities of daily living. Other exploratory assessments include the six minute walk test, spirometry, and muscle ultrasound. There is also an assessment of day-to-day mobility using wearable sensors.
ReSOLVE Natural History Study
The Clinical Trial Readiness to Solve Barriers to Drug Development in FSHD, or ReSOLVE study, is an ongoing natural history study funded by the NIH to help identify the patient population, efficacy biomarker and clinical outcome assessments for future FSHD drug trials. The study is being coordinated by the University of Rochester and University of Kansas Medical Center and enrolled the first subject in April 2018. The study will follow up to 160 subjects for 24 months across a network of eight U.S. clinical centers and will evaluate multiple biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments that may be suitable for clinical trials and will evaluate patient selection criteria based on genetic, demographic or clinical characteristics. Three sites in the European Union have joined the ReSOLVE protocol and will follow 60 subjects for 24 months. We believe that the results of this natural history study will inform the design and implementation of clinical trials and will inform discussions with regulatory agencies. We also believe that this study may provide valuable insights into the timeline for disease progression and functional changes in FSHD in the absence of treatment.
In connection with the ReSOLVE study, we have funded the addition of a clinical outcome assessment, which we refer to as RWS. RWS is a measure of function that assesses upper extremity range of motion. Specifically, it evaluates total shoulder and proximal arm mobility by utilizing 3D motion sensor technology. Preserving function, as assessed by RWS, is critical for maintaining abilities for self-care and other activities of daily living that directly influence quality of life. Based on published results, RWS is an important measure of independence. The RWS assessments are analyzed by a central reader. We have provided standardized hardware, software, and testing conditions to evaluate RWS at eight sites that are part of the ReSOLVE study in the United States and at three European sites. Furthermore, the RWS assessment has been registered as a medical device in the United States, Canada and Europe.
A recent third-party study assessed changes in RWS for 18 subjects with FSHD for up to five years. As illustrated in the figure below, the study concluded that the RWS measure is able to detect slow declines in upper extremity function in subjects with FSHD as early as 1 year. The study also found that the most notable declines in RWS were in above-the-shoulder level quadrants with no significant changes in lower quadrants and that RWS declined more significantly if the subjects wore 500-gram weights on their wrists.




The figure above illustrates RWS in four quadrants. The optimized RWS includes an additional domain for the lower back, as illustrated in the figure below.
 


Prior Clinical Development of Losmapimod by GSK
 GSK conducted multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and one Phase 3 clinical trial of losmapimod, including in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, acute coronary syndrome and other cardiovascular diseases, neuropathic pain, major depression disorder, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Nearly 3,500 subjects in 24 trials were given losmapimod with single doses as high as 60 mg and repeated oral doses as high as 15 mg twice per day for up to 52 weeks. We are using a dose of 15 mg twice per day in our clinical trials of losmapimod in FSHD. GSK did not conduct a clinical trial of losmapimod in patients with FSHD or any other muscle disorder.
 In clinical trials of losmapimod conducted by GSK, no significant differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events, or AEs, in subjects given losmapimod and subjects given placebo. GSK generally observed a similar frequency of serious adverse events, or SAEs, and deaths between patients given losmapimod and patients given placebo. These trials included extensive evaluation of the cardiovascular risk profile of losmapimod, including completion of an evaluation of the potential to prolong corrected QT. GSK reported that there was no clinically relevant difference with regard to the occurrence of electrocardiogram abnormalities post-baseline or vital signs with losmapimod as compared to placebo. GSK did not identify a safety signal attributed to losmapimod in any of these trials. There were no SAEs reported in 14 of these 24 clinical trials of losmapimod.
The largest placebo-controlled clinical trial of losmapimod conducted by GSK was a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome following a heart attack, in which over 1,700 patients were given 7.5 mg of losmapimod or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks and were followed for an additional 12 weeks. In this trial, GSK observed a similar proportion of AEs and SAEs in the placebo group as compared to the losmapimod group.
 There were also ten SAEs of fatality in the placebo group and 13 SAEs of fatality in the losmapimod group. In the placebo group, the SAEs of fatality were infections and infestations (two), general disorders and administrative site conditions (two), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (three), cardiac disorder (one), gastrointestinal disorder (one) and neoplasm (one). In the losmapimod group, the SAEs of fatatity were infections and infestations (four), general disorders and administrative site conditions (three), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (two), cardiac disorder (one), injury poisoning and procedural complications (one), gastrointestinal disorder (one) and neoplasm (one).
Among the total of 14 Phase 1 and Phase2 placebo-controlled clinical trials of losmapimod (N=1327 on losmapimod; N=735 on placebo), the distribution of SAEs was similar among losmapimod-treated and placebo-treated subjects. The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders (2% placebo; 3% losmapimod) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1% placebo; 2% losmapimod). SAEs were reported in 11 of these 14 trials; 3 trials reported no SAEs.
 In addition to the 24 trials conducted by GSK, another sponsor conducted a placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of losmapimod in which 73 subjects with COPD with cardiovascular manifestations were given 7.5 mg of losmapimod or placebo for 16 weeks. There were 36 subjects in the losmapimod group and 37 in the placebo group. In this trial, there were a total of six (17%) SAEs in the losmapimod group, consisting of exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia, and there was one (3%) SAE in the placebo group.
FTX-6058
Hemoglobinopathies are a category of genetic disorders affecting hemoglobin, a critical component of RBCs. The function of hemoglobin is to deliver oxygen to tissues: hemoglobin picks up oxygen as RBCs circulate through the lungs and then drops off oxygen to the tissues so that they may function normally. Hemoglobinopathies result in either abnormal (mutant) hemoglobin or low levels of hemoglobin, and both of these conditions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality risks. We are developing FTX-6058, which is designed elevate the level of HbF for the treatment of people with certain hemoglobinopathies, including SCD. We also believe that people with some types of ß-thalassemia may benefit from treatment with FTX-6058.
 Overview of Sickle Cell Disease
Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder of RBCs. The root cause of SCD is a mutant hemoglobin that polymerizes in low oxygen conditions. This polymerization creates the abnormal, elongated, or sickle, shape of the RBC and results in, ultimately, hemolysis and vascular injury that causes major morbidities and significantly limits lifespan in people with SCD. People with SCD typically suffer from serious clinical consequences, which may include vaso-occlusive crises, anemia, pain, infections, stroke, heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, kidney failure, liver disease and reduced life expectancy. According to a study published by the American Medical Association, approximately 32.5% of adults with SCD were hospitalized three or more times per year due to pain crises. SCD is reported to shorten life expectancy by approximately 20 to 30 years. People with SCD are primarily treated by hematologists.

In the United States, where newborn screening for SCD is mandatory, the estimated prevalence is approximately 100,000 individuals. In Europe, the estimated prevalence is approximately 50,000 individuals. According to the World Health Organization, the global incidence is estimated to be approximately 300,000 births annually. SCD is most prevalent in Africa and the Middle East.
Approved drug treatments for SCD focus primarily on the management and reduction of painful vaso-occlusive crises, and improvement of hemolytic anemia. The four drug treatments approved in the United States are hydroxyurea, voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine. Hydroxyurea is approved for the treatment of SCD to reduce the frequency of painful crises and to reduce the need for blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea has a black box warning for myelosuppression and malignancy. In general, it is limited by its adverse side effects, inconsistent responses and concerns regarding the cytotoxic effect of the drug. Voxelotor, marketed by Pfizer, Inc., is approved under accelerated approval as a hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor to increase hemoglobin. This approach maintains or increases the total amount of HbS, the mutant hemoglobin in SCD, by holding on to oxygen longer. Crizanlizumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody p-selectin inhibitor marketed by Novartis AG, or Novartis, is approved for the reduction in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. L-glutamine is approved to reduce acute complications of the disorder.
 The only potentially curative treatment currently approved for severe SCD is hematopoeitic stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, HSCT is more commonly offered to pediatric individuals with an available HLA-matched sibling donor. The 5-year survival rates in this young SCD population is quite high but for older individuals (>16 years), the survival rates can be considerably lower. There are also significant risks associated with HSCT including infertility and graft-versus-host disease.
While multiple experimental approaches to treat SCD are being explored in clinical trials, the majority are focused on symptomatic relief or as last-line gene therapy approaches. Symptomatic approaches under investigation aim to affect issues associated with cell adhesion, sickling, thrombosis and iron homeostasis. We anticipate that a novel oral HbF inducer that affects the root cause of SCD by inhibiting the pathological polymerization caused by the mutant hemoglobin may become the standard of care for SCD. Novartis and Pfizer, Inc. have received approval for therapies aiming to provide relief for specific elements of SCD (low hemoglobin and VOCs respectively). Several gene therapy approaches to treat SCD are focused on elevating HbF, however no gene therapy approaches have been approved for SCD and the efficacy, safety and durability of gene therapy approaches have yet to be established. Gene therapies need to be administered in an in-patient procedure through HSCT. As part of the transplant process, the patient receives myeloablative chemotherapy which kills cells in the bone marrow in order to support the gene therapy. Despite ongoing efforts to develop gene therapies for SCD, we believe there is still a high unmet need that could be better addressed by a small molecule, oral therapy to treat the disease by increasing HbF.
SCD Biology
SCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene. This gene encodes a protein that is a key component of hemoglobin, a protein complex whose function is to transport oxygen in the body. Hemoglobin in adults is a complex of four proteins, two hemoglobin ß-subunits and two hemoglobin α-subunits. In people with SCD, hemoglobin is composed of two mutant ß-subunits and two α-subunits and the result is the formation of HbS. The result of the mutation is less efficient oxygen transport and the formation of RBCs that have a sickle shape. These sickle shaped cells are much less flexible than healthy cells and can block blood vessels (vaso-occlusion) or rupture cells (lysis), leading to pain, anemia, irreversible organ damage or even death.
During fetal development, the major form of hemoglobin is HbF. Similar to hemoglobin in adults, HbF is also a complex of four proteins, two α-subunits and two γ-subunits. Shortly after birth, the genes encoding the γ-subunits, the HBG1 and HBG2 genes, are silenced and the HBB gene is activated. As described above, SCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene that gives rise to mutated ß-subunits.
 A small subset of individuals with the sickle cell mutation continue to produce high levels of HbF due to inheritance of additional genetic mutations, which is called Hereditary Persistence of HbF, or HPFH. Individuals with elevated HbF exhibit minimal clinical manifestations of SCD. HbF levels as low as 3% over baseline in individuals without HPFH, due to either therapeutic intervention or the inheritance of other genetic traits, can result in reduced clinical manifestations of the disease.


   
Our Approach to Address the Root Cause of SCD
Our strategy to address the root cause of SCD was to identify a drug mechanism that induces expression of HbF. We believe that FTX-6058 may address the root cause of SCD through this mechanism of action.
Overview of ß-Thalassemia
ß-thalassemia is a rare blood disorder associated with the absence or reduced production of ß-globin, which is one of the two proteins that comprise adult hemoglobin. This results in an abnormally low level of hemoglobin as well as an excess of α-globin chains that cause destruction of RBCs. The severity of the phenotype is related to the degree of imbalance between α- and non-α-globin chain synthesis. The absence of ß-globin due to HBB gene deletions is referred to as ß0 thalassemia. Other HBB gene alterations allow some ß-globin to be produced but in reduced amounts. A reduced amount of ß-globin is called ß+thalassemia. Many patients with ß-thalassemia require chronic blood transfusions due to severe anemia that results from low hemoglobin levels, which are referred to as transfusion-dependent patients. It is estimated that 40,000 babies are born worldwide with ß-thalassemia per year of whom 25,000 require blood transfusions. Patients with ß-thalassemia are primarily treated by hematologists.
ß-thalassemia has been clinically characterized into three forms, depending on disease severity: major, intermedia and minor. The most severe form, ß-thalassemia major (also known as Cooley’s anemia), is generally diagnosed shortly after birth and patients have life-threatening anemia. Pediatric patients do not grow and gain weight at the typical rates, and often have liver, heart and bone problems. Many ß-thalassemia major patients require frequent blood transfusions to prevent severe anemia, a treatment that itself can cause long-term problems due to a build-up of iron in the body. ß-thalassemia intermedia is a less severe form of the disease that results in mild to moderate anemia. These patients sometimes require blood transfusions depending on the severity of the symptoms. Patients with ß-thalassemia minor suffer from very mild anemia and generally do not require treatment. Having either ß0 or ß+ thalassemia does not necessarily predict clinical disease severity as people with both types have been diagnosed with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia.
The current standard of care for many patients with transfusion dependent ß-thalassemia is frequent red blood transfusions to manage anemia. These frequent transfusions may lead to complications of iron overload, which has to be treated with iron chelation therapies. While allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for ß-thalassemia, usage of this intervention is limited due to risks of complications, including mortality, and challenges of identifying a suitable HLA-matched sibling donor. In June 2019, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO, a gene therapy developed by bluebird bio, Inc., or bluebird, for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia and with certain genotypes, in Europe. However, in August 2021, bluebird announced plans to end commercial operations in Europe and has decided to focus on the U.S. market. ZYNTEGLO was approved by the FDA in August 2022 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. Reblozyl (luspatercept), an erythroid maturation agent, is approved for the treatment of adult patients with anemia associated with ß-thalassemia and who require frequent transfusions. Despite these recently approved gene therapies and small molecule, we believe there is still a high unmet need that could be addressed by a small molecule, oral therapy to treatment the disease by increasing HbF.

Biology of ß-Thalassemia
ß-thalassemia is caused by genetic mutations in the HBB gene. The mutations interfere with the production of ß-globin. Some mutations result in no ß-globin being produced, while other mutations result in a decreased amount of ß-globin being produced.
Our Approach to Address the Root Cause of ß-Thalassemia
We believe that some types of ß-thalassemia may be treated by a therapy that upregulates HbF. Babies born with ß-thalassemia major generally do not have any symptoms shortly after birth because they have HbF in their blood. As the HbF levels decrease after birth and the ß-globin fails to increase, anemia appears and the babies with ß-thalassemia begin to exhibit symptoms of the disease. Patients with ß-thalassemia intermedia that have higher levels of HbF have fewer symptoms than patients with low levels of HbF. We believe that FTX-6058 may be suitable for clinical development for the treatment of patients who are not ß0 but who are transfusion dependent.
FulcrumSeek Identified the Drug Target for Certain Hemoglobinopathies
Applying FulcrumSeek, we conducted target identification and validation activities using human umbilical cord blood-derived erythroid progenitor 2, or HUDEP2, cells as a model to study HbF reactivation. HUDEP2 cells are immature RBCs. By screening our small molecule probe library and a CRISPR library, we identified several potential drug targets that activated the HBG1/2 genes and resulted in HbF elevation. Each screening approach identified the same protein complex which we believe plays an important role in the expression of genes responsible for the production of HbF. We conducted additional validation experiments in which we observed that inhibition of several components of this complex resulted in the desired elevation of HbF. We also observed that inhibition of these components did not adversely affect important cell health markers.
We selected a member of this protein complex for drug discovery activities following an assessment of its tractability as a drug target, which we refer to as the HbF drug target. The normal physiological role of the HbF drug target is to facilitate a post-translational protein modification, and the goal of our medicinal chemistry program was to optimize inhibitors of the HbF drug target. We developed in vitro and in vivo target engagement assays, as well as enabled X-ray crystallography, to discover and develop FTX-6058, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the HbF drug target.
FTX-6058
FTX-6058 is an oral HbF inducer that is in development for certain hemoglobinopathies, including SCD. FTX-6058 is designed to bind to EED and inhibit the transcriptional silencing activity of PRC2. Inhibition of EED leads to potent downregulation of key fetal globin repressors, including BCL11A, thereby causing an increase in HbF. EED is a member of the PRC2 complex, which also includes EZH2. There are approved products in the EZH2 class of medications and their approved labeling outlines safety risks, including an increased risk of malignancies. We initiated our Phase 1b clinical trial of FTX-6058 in people with SCD in the fourth quarter of 2021. In February 2022, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to FTX-6058 for the treatment of SCD. In December 2022, the FDA granted fast track designation to FTX-6058 for SCD. On February 23, 2023, the FDA placed the IND for FTX-6058 for the potential treatment of SCD on full clinical hold. Accordingly, we suspended enrollment and dosing in the Phase 1b trial of FTX-6058 and withdrew our separate IND for FTX-6058 in beta thalassemia. The FDA’s clinical hold referenced the data from toxicology studies in rats and dogs that we submitted to the IND in April, October, and December 2022, as well as a response to an early February 2023 information request from the FDA about these toxicology studies that we submitted in mid-February 2023.
As part of our FTX-6058 development program, we have conducted numerous non-clinical toxicology studies, including studies conducted under good laboratory practice, or GLP. These toxicology studies have included repeat-dose maximum tolerated dose and dose range finding studies; 28-day, 13-week, 17-week, and 26-week studies in rats; and 28-day, 13-week, and 39-week studies in dogs. In connection with the clinical hold, the FDA noted that the profile of hematological malignancies observed in the toxicology studies of FTX-6058 is similar to that observed with other inhibitors of PRC2 and that hematological malignancies have been reported clinically with other inhibitors of PRC2. We intend to work diligently to provide, as expeditiously as possible, the information that the FDA will require for resolution of the clinical hold.

Clinical Trial: Phase 1b
In January 2023, we announced Phase 1b data from subjects in the 6 mg dose cohort, as well as completion of enrollment in the 6 mg and 2 mg dose cohorts and commencement of enrollment in the 12 mg dose cohort. Until being placed on clinical hold, the Phase 1b trial was evaluating subjects both on and off hydroxyurea.
 Phase 1b data from subjects in the 6 mg dose cohort (n=10) showed up to 9.5% absolute HbF increases from baseline. These data suggested no difference in response in subjects on (n=3) and off (n=7) background hydroxyurea. We also observed improved biomarkers of hemolysis in evaluable subjects dosed at 6 mg. The figures below illustrate percentage HbF increase by HPLC and absolute percentage HbF change from baseline for evaluable subjects (n=7) in the 6 mg dose cohort.
 
We have completed enrollment and dosing in the 6 mg and 2 mg dose cohorts, and we do not plan to enroll or dose additional subjects in these cohorts if we are able to resolve the clinical hold. Data from subjects in the 2 mg dose cohort (n=2), showed up to 4.6% absolute HbF increases from baseline.


   Enrollment and dosing of additional subjects in the 12 mg dose cohort (including subjects both on and off hydroxyurea), is currently on hold. Data from subjects in the 12 mg dose cohort (n=3), prior to the suspension of the trial, showed up to 10.0% absolute HbF increases from baseline after 42 days of treatment. Subjects with asterisks were on hydroxyurea.



Increases in HbF have been shown to reduce the frequency or severity of a broad range of SCD symptoms, including VOC, anemia, pain, infection, stroke and others. Based on a large body of genetic, clinical, and observational evidence showing the effects of higher levels of HbF in people with SCD, the induction of HbF by 5-10% over baseline could be associated with reduced disease burden and improved clinical outcomes. We believe these initial data showing that FTX-6058 increases HbF levels by up to 9.5% support its potential to become a transformative therapy for people living with SCD.
 FTX-6058 was generally well-tolerated as of the March 3, 2023 data cutoff date. There have been 14 TEAEs reported to date, two of which were reported as possibly related to study drug (headache, lip numbness), neither of which were severe and were deemed non-serious. There have been no discontinuations due to TEAEs. Three of the 14 TEAEs were characterized as VOCs, and were deemed unrelated to FTX-6058, one of which was reported as a serious adverse event, or SAE, with acute chest syndrome in a non-adherent subject.
 At this time, we are not certain when we will be able to resume the Phase 1b trial, if at all.
 Clinical Trial: Phase 1 Healthy Volunteers
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of FTX-6058 in healthy adult volunteers. The Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of ascending doses of FTX-6058. In the SAD cohorts, healthy volunteers received one dose of either placebo or 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 60mg of FTX-6058. In the MAD cohorts, healthy volunteers received a once-daily dose of placebo or 2, 6, 10, 20 or 30mg of FTX-6058 for 14 consecutive days. Each MAD cohort had six subjects on drug and two on placebo. Food effect was also studied in a separate 20mg dose cohort. Exploratory measures were included in the MAD cohorts to assess target engagement, changes in HBG mRNA and HbF-containing reticulocytes (F-reticulocytes).
We reported data from the 2, 4, 10, 20, 30 and 40mg SAD cohorts and the 2, 6 and 10 mg MAD cohorts in healthy volunteers in August 2021, and we reported data from the 60 mg SAD cohort and the 20 and 30 mg MAD cohorts in healthy volunteers, as well as data from the 20 mg cohort assessing food effect in December 2021.

FTX-6058 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs reported and no discontinuations due to TEAEs across all SAD and MAD cohorts. Data continued to show dose-proportional PK, with a mean half-life of approximately 6-7 hours in the MAD cohorts, supporting once-daily dosing, and no food effect was observed with FTX-6058. Data from the MAD cohorts continued to show robust target engagement, as evidenced by an approximately 75-95% reduction from baseline in H3K27me3 after 14 days of treatment. Based on our preclinical studies, this level of target engagement is predicted to result in robust induction of HBG1/2 and subsequently increase HbF production.
 Data from the MAD cohorts also showed time- and dose-dependent HBG mRNA induction, as shown in the chart below, demonstrating proof-of-biology. Persistent HBG mRNA induction was observed for 7-10 days after treatment. In preclinical studies of FTX-6058, increases in HBG mRNA have consistently translated to the same fold increases in HbF protein. Notably, human genetics show that 2-3-fold increases in HbF over typical baseline levels (5-10% HbF) are associated with significantly improved outcomes, and even functional cures, in people with SCD. .

FTX-6058 Activity in Preclinical Studies
We have observed in vitro and in vivo activation of the HBG1/2 genes in preclinical studies with FTX-6058. We observed that FTX-6058 elevated levels of HbF with minimal adverse effects on important cellular health markers. As depicted in the graphic below, we also observed in vitro upregulation of HbF in primary human CD34+ cells differentiated into RBCs from 14 donors, including nine different healthy human donors, four SCD donors and one sickle cell trait donor, after seven days of drug treatment. FTX-6058 showed a significant elevation of HbF over baseline in each of these 14 donor cell lines. We have conducted additional preclinical profiling in CD34+ derived cells and observed that treatment with FTX-6058 increased HbF levels to approximately 30% of total hemoglobin, as measured by mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography techniques. Notably, based on a review of data from other mechanisms, HbF fold induction in CD34+ cells has translated reliably into the clinic.
Effect of FTX-6058 treatment
in differentiated primary human CD34+ cells




Additionally, we compared the effect of FTX-6058 in CD34+ derived cells relative to that of hydroxyurea. We observed that hydroxyurea had a minimal impact on HbF elevation, whereas we observed that FTX-6058 significantly elevated HbF. In cells treated with the combination of FTX-6058 and hydroxyurea, we observed an increased effect relative to either compound alone.
 Additionally, we studied FTX-6058 in a mouse model of SCD, known as the Townes mouse model. In this model, mouse globin genes have been replaced with human globin genes, thereby allowing investigations of mechanisms that may regulate human hemoglobin gene expression. The Townes mouse model has been widely used to study potential treatments for SCD. As shown in the figures below, we observed that FTX-6058 resulted in a significant increase in HbF-expressing cells, or F-cells, and HbF protein levels after 13 days of dosing at 5 mg/kg once per day whereas hydroxyurea resulted in modest increases in F-cells and HbF.


Percentage of F-cells in Townes micetreated with FTX-6058 | HbF protein levels in Townes micetreated with FTX-6058

 In the graphic on the left, we quantified the percentage of F-cells as a percentage of total cells (%F-cells) for the three treatment conditions from mouse blood, shown as a percentage of vehicle-alone-treated SCD mice. In the graphic on the right, we determined the level of human HbF protein for the three treatment conditions, quantifying HbF protein as a percentage of total hemoglobin. Each value represents the mean value from eight mice per treatment after 13 days of treatment. In these studies, we used a conventional method of assessing statistical significance known as a one-way analysis of variance, or ANOVA. The p-value for FTX-6058 was less than 0.001 for both studies and the p-value for hydroxyurea in the study depicted on the right was less than 0.01.
 Our Discovery Platform
 FulcrumSeek is our high-throughput discovery platform that we designed to identify and validate drug targets for our rare disease portfolio. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, there are approximately 7,000 rare, genetically defined human diseases, many of which have inadequate or no approved treatments. In our approach, we obtain patient-derived, tissue-relevant cell lines or other disease relevant cell lines, which we differentiate to recapitulate and interrogate the targeted disease pathology.
These cell lines are interrogated at scale, using our proprietary automation systems to study the effects of chemical and genomic perturbations on the disease phenotype or transcriptome. We apply our highly annotated, proprietary small-molecule compound library of chemogenomic probes, designed with the intent to optimize biological diversity. In contrast with other small molecule screening approaches that optimize chemical diversity, our highly annotated library enables the rapid identification and validation of targets, as well as potential lead molecules that modulate these targets.
 We also employ computational biology, such as machine learning algorithms, to guide drug target selection. Our iterative and systematic approach enables us to explore diseases with less-defined genetic links, and instead screen for targets that modulate root cause biology. As a result, we believe that we can greatly expand the number of diseases that we can potentially interrogate with FulcrumSeek.


Discovery Screening Programs
We have leveraged FulcrumSeek to discover targets that we are pursuing with small molecules for FSHD and SCD. We are leveraging the broad applicability of FulcrumSeek to discover drug targets for other rare, genetically defined diseases across muscular, hematologic and neurologic disorders.
   
Our target identification strategy and approach continue to evolve. In addition to conducting screens to identify targets that modulate the expression of a single root cause gene, we are able to simultaneously interrogate multiple (approximately 10) root cause genes and to monitor effects on cell health all in a single screen (i.e., multiplexed screening). We believe that this new approach provides significant efficiencies in productivity and allows us to test multiple hypotheses in parallel. Importantly, the expansion of FulcrumSeek with the use of high content molecular profiling, including RNAseq and cellular imaging, allows us to simultaneously measure the expression of 8,000-10,000 genes and integrate key measures related to cell health and biology, which enables us to scale our screening capacity and productivity. With the use of our small molecule probe library and our functional genomics capabilities, we aim to conduct target identification at a significantly increased scale and with cost-effectiveness. Moreover, we are using our product engine in hypothesis testing mode and in hypothesis generation mode, which we expect to increase the probability of identifying attractive targets to advance in our portfolio or in collaboration with partners.
 License Agreements and Collaborations
 Right of Reference and License Agreement with GlaxoSmithKline
In February 2019, we entered into a right of reference and license agreement with affiliates of GSK, as amended in September 2020, pursuant to which GSK granted us a right of reference to certain INDs filed with the FDA and controlled by GSK or its affiliates relating to losmapimod and an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights related to losmapimod. The agreement also provides us with an exclusive worldwide license to certain of GSK’s preclinical and clinical data with respect to losmapimod. As partial consideration for the right of reference and licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 12,500,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock to GSK at the time we entered into the reference and license agreement. The agreement obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product for the treatment of FSHD.
The agreement grants us an exclusive, sublicensable license under the licensed patent rights and data rights to research, develop and commercialize losmapimod or any product containing losmapimod as an API, which we refer to as a licensed product, to treat disease in humans. GSK retained the right, without the right to grant sublicenses, to conduct nonclinical research under the licensed patents and data rights and, with our consent, GSK may engage in certain developmental activities relating to the use of a licensed product in connection with a specified prophylactic use. GSK also agreed to and has since transferred to us its existing manufactured supply of losmapimod.
Under the agreement, we will be obligated to make milestone payments to GSK aggregating up to $37.5 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones with respect to the first licensed product to first achieve such milestones, including a $5.0 million milestone payment that we made to GSK during the year ended December 31, 2022 upon the initiation of the REACH Phase 3 clinical trial and a $2.5 million milestone payment we made to GSK during the year ended December 31, 2019 upon the initiation of ReDUX4, and up to $60.0 million upon the first achievement of one-time aggregate annual worldwide net sales milestones for a licensed product. We will also be obligated to pay royalties

ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a low double-digit, but less than teens, percentage to GSK based on our, and any of our affiliates’ and sublicensees’, annual net sales of licensed products. The royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, and may be reduced in specified circumstances.
Our obligation to make royalty payments extends with respect to a licensed product in a country until the earlier of the approval of a generic version of such licensed product by the applicable regulatory agency in such country or the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, which we refer to as the royalty term. Following the expiration of any exclusive marketing rights or data exclusivity rights granted by a regulatory authority, other than patent rights, for any licensed product on a country-by-country basis, the applicable royalty rate will be reduced in such country. Additionally, if we or our affiliates or sublicensees determine that it is necessary to obtain a license from a third party under any patent rights to exploit a licensed product in a country, then we may deduct a certain percentage of the license fees under such third party license payable by us to the third party from the royalty payment that would otherwise be due to GSK in such country.
Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the agreement continues on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the royalty term in each country, at which time the agreement expires with respect to such licensed product in such country and we shall have a fully-paid up, royalty-free and perpetual license to the licensed patent rights and data rights with respect to such licensed product in such country. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party has materially breached in the performance of its obligations under the agreement and such breach has not been cured within the applicable cure period.
Collaboration and License Agreement with MyoKardia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
 In July 2020, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with MyoKardia to identify biological targets that are capable of modulating genes of interest with relevance to certain genetically defined cardiomyopathies. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted MyoKardia an exclusive worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer for sale, have offered for sale, import, have imported, export, have exported, distribute, have distributed, market, have marketed, promote, have promoted, or otherwise exploit products directed against certain biological targets identified by us that are capable of modulating certain genes of interest with relevance to certain genetically defined cardiomyopathies.
 Pursuant to a mutually agreed research plan, we will perform assay screening and related research activities to identify and validate up to a specified number of potential cardiomyopathy gene targets, or the Identified Targets, for further research, development, manufacture and commercialization by MyoKardia. We and MyoKardia will work together to determine how best to advance at each stage of the research activities under the research plan and to identify which of the Identified Targets, if any, meet the criteria set forth in the research plan, or the Cardiomyopathy Target Candidates. Upon completion of the research plan, the parties will work together to prepare a final data package and MyoKardia may designate certain Cardiomyopathy Target Candidates for MyoKardia’s further exploitation under the agreement, or the Cardiomyopathy Targets. If MyoKardia does not designate any Cardiomyopathy Targets during the designated period, then the agreement will automatically terminate. If MyoKardia designates one or more Cardiomyopathy Targets, then MyoKardia will be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and to commercialize one product directed against an Identified Target in certain specified countries.
During the period in which we are performing the research activities pursuant to the research plan, or the Research Term and for a specified period beyond the Research Term if MyoKardia designates a Cardiomyopathy Target, we may only use the data generated from such research activities for MyoKardia in accordance with the agreement. During the Research Term and for a specified period thereafter, we may not research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, use, or otherwise exploit any compound or product (a) that is a compound or product under the agreement that is directed against the Cardiomyopathy Target Candidates for the treatment, prophylaxis, or diagnosis of any indication or (b) for the treatment of any genetically defined cardiomyopathies shown to be related to certain specified genes of interest that are modulated by the Cardiomyopathy Targets.
 Under the agreement, MyoKardia made a $10.0 million upfront payment and a $2.5 million payment as prepaid research funding to us in July 2020. MyoKardia will also reimburse us for the costs of the research activities not covered by the prepaid research funding, up to a maximum amount of total research funding (including the prepaid research funding). Upon the achievement of specified preclinical, development and sales-based milestones, we will be entitled to preclinical milestone payments, development milestone payments and sales-based milestone payments of up to $298.5 million in the aggregate per target for certain Identified Targets, and of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate per target for certain other Identified Targets. To date, we have achieved a $2.5 million specified preclinical milestone. MyoKardia will also pay us tiered royalties ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage based on MyoKardia’s, and any of its affiliates’ and sublicensees’, annual worldwide net sales of products under the agreement directed against any Identified

Target. The royalties are payable on a product-by-product basis during a specified royalty term, and may be reduced in specified circumstances.
The agreement continues on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term for a product, at which time the agreement expires with respect to such product in such country, unless the agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party has materially breached in the performance of its obligations and such breach has not been cured within the applicable cure period. MyoKardia also has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety or on a target-by-target, product-by-product or molecule-by-molecule basis, upon prior written notice to us.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce in our intellectual property rights, in particular our patents rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also cannot ensure that patents will issue with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
We generally file patent applications directed to our key programs in an effort to secure our intellectual property positions vis-a-vis these programs. As of March 2, 2023, we owned or in-licensed 11 U.S. patents, seven U.S. pending non-provisional patent applications and related pending foreign patent applications, and three pending U.S. provisional patent applications.
The intellectual property portfolio for our most advanced programs as of March 2, 2023, is summarized below. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may be significantly narrowed before issuance, if issued at all. We expect this may be the case with respect to some of our pending patent applications referred to below.
Losmapimod
 With respect to losmapimod, we own one U.S. patent covering the method of use of losmapimod for the treatment of patients with FSHD and two U.S. patent covering the use of other clinical-stage p38 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with FSHD, each of which are expected to expire in 2038, and related patents and pending patent applications in Canada and Mexico, Europe, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, South America, and Asia with expiration dates in 2038. We also own three related pending U.S. non-provisional applications, one pending PCT application and one pending U.S. provisional application relating to method of using losmapimod for FSHD and other disorders that, if resulting in issued patents, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2043. The patents to losmapimod licensed from GSK as a composition of matter and pharmaceutical composition have expired.
 FTX-6058
 Currently, our patent portfolio related to FTX-6058 includes two issued U.S. patents directed to composition of matter that is expected to expire in 2040, two U.S. non-provisional applications and related pending patent applications in Canada

and Mexico, Europe, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, South America, and Asia that, if issued, are expected to expire between 2039 and 2040. We also own three pending PCT applications and two pending U.S. provisional applications directed to FTX-6058 methods of use and formulations, that, if resulting in issued patents, would be expected to expire between 2042 and 2043.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering the use of losmapimod and products from our intellectual property may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our use of drug candidates or the drug candidate itself receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved use or drug candidate. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We have obtained sufficient quantities of losmapimod from a contract manufacturing organization to complete our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial in FSHD.
We have obtained sufficient quantities of FTX-6058 from a contract manufacturing organization to complete our Phase 1b clinical trial, which is currently on clinical hold.
 We expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of FTX-6058 for any future clinical trials and for the manufacture of any future product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Our lead product candidates are small molecules and can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval or emergency use authorizations for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we are currently undertaking clinical trials, they will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below.
FSHD
There are no approved therapies for the treatment of FSHD. Current treatment is limited to symptomatic management including physical/ occupational therapy, low-intensity aerobic exercise tailored to the patient’s distribution of weakness, and general pain management, which may provide limited beneficial effect. Limited range of motion in the shoulder girdle can stem from periscapular muscle weakness leading to scapular winging and in such cases, surgical scapular fixation can result in some functional improvement for certain patients.
Losmapimod could face competition from other therapeutic approaches in development for patients with FSHD. Roche is evaluating RO7204239, a myostatin inhibitor, in a Phase 2 study in adults with FSHD. Avidity is evaluating AOC 1020, an siRNA antibody-oligonucleotide complex, in a Phase½2 clinical trial in adults with FSHD. We are not aware of any product candidate currently in clinical development for FSHD with the same mechanism of action as losmapimod.
 SCD
Approved drug treatments for SCD focus primarily on the management and reduction of painful vaso-occlusive crises, and improvement of hemolytic anemia. The four drug treatments approved in the United States are hydroxyurea, voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine. Hydroxyurea is approved for the treatment of SCD, to reduce the frequency of painful crises and to reduce the need for blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea is available in both generic and brand name formulations including DROXIA manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb, and SIKLOS manufactured by Addmedica. Voxelotor, brand name OXBRYTA, marketed by Pfizer Inc., is approved under accelerated approval as a hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor to increase hemoglobin. Crizanlizumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody p-selectin inhibitor marketed by Novartis, is approved for the reduction in the frequency of VOCs. L-glutamine, brand name ENDARI, marketed by Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc., is approved to reduce acute complications of the disorder.
A supportive care option for management of SCD is red blood cell transfusion but this can potentially be complicated by alloimmunization, transfusion reactions, and iron overload.
 The only potentially curative treatment currently approved for severe SCD populations is HSCT. However, HSCT is more commonly offered to pediatric individuals with an available HLA-matched sibling donor. The 5-year survival rates in this young population is quite high but for older individuals (>16 years), the survival rates can be considerably lower. There are also significant risks associated with HSCT including infertility and graft-versus-host disease.
 FTX-6058 could face competition from a number of different therapeutic approaches in development for people with SCD. Novo Nordisk A/S, or Novo, is evaluating nDec (decitabine-tetrahydrouridine), a small molecule designed to increase production of HbF, in a Phase 2 clinical trial that began enrolling in the summer of 2022. Novo is also evaluating etavopivat,

a PKR agonist, in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial. Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is evaluating mitapivat, a PKR agonist, in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in subjects with SCD. Pfizer, Inc. is evaluating GBT-601, an HbS polymerization inhibitor, that is anticipated to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in 2023, inclacumab, a P-selectin inhibitor that is being evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, and PF-07209326, an anti-E-selectin inhibitor, in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, is evaluating TAK-755, recombinant ADAMTS13 protein, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in participants with baseline health SCD and SCD with acute VOCs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, expects to complete a rolling BLA submission in the first quarter of 2023 for exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), a gene therapy for the potential treatment of SCD. Vertex has announced that they intend to focus initial commercialization efforts on 32,000 people with severe SCD and ß-thalassemia in the United States and the EU. Sangamo Therapeutics Inc., or Sangamo, is developing SAR445136, a gene editing cell therapy that modifies cells to produce functional RBCs using HbF, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. bluebird is evaluating lovo-cel, a gene therapy, in a Phase 3 clinical trial and expects to submit a BLA in the first quarter of 2023. There are also several other gene editing approaches being evaluated by Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Novartis), Editas Medicine, Inc., Graphite Bio, and Beam Therapeutics.
ß-thalassemia
The current standard of care for many patients with transfusion dependent ß-thalassemia is frequent red blood transfusions to manage anemia. These frequent transfusions may lead to complications of iron overload, which has to be treated with iron chelation therapies. While allogeneic HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for ß-thalassemia, usage of this intervention is limited due to risks of complications, including mortality, and challenges of identifying a HLA-matched sibling. In June 2019, European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for ZYNTEGLO, a gene therapy developed by bluebird, for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia and with certain genotypes, in Europe. However, in August 2021, bluebird announced plans to end commercial operations in Europe and has decided to focus on the U.S. market. ZYNTEGLO was approved by the FDA in August 2022 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. Reblozyl (luspatercept), an erythroid maturation agent, is approved for the treatment of adult patients with anemia associated with ß-thalassemia and who require frequent transfusions. Despite these recently approved gene therapies and small molecule, we believe there is still a high unmet need that could be addressed by a small molecule, oral therapy to treatment the disease by increasing HbF.
FTX-6058 could face competition from a number of different therapeutic approaches in development for patients with transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia. Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is evaluating mitapivat, a PKR agonist, in two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with non-transfusion dependent and transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia. Novo is evaluating etavopivat , a PKR agonist, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in non-transfusion and transfusion-dependent ß-thalassemia. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is evaluating sapablursen (formerly IONIS TMPRSS6-LRx), an ASO therapy targeting TMPRSS6, in a Phase 2 clinical trial of non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia intermedia. Disc Medicine is developing MWTX-003, a monoclonal antibody against TMPRSS6 and plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023. Silence Therapeutics is investigating SLN124, an siRNA therapy targeting TMPRSS6, in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study. Vertex expects to complete a rolling BLA submission in the first quarter of 2023 for exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), a gene therapy for the potential treatment of transfusion dependent ß-thalassemia
 Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Approval and Regulation of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, drug products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.


An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be approved by the FDA:
•preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations and standards; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a drug product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s); 
 •review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA; 
 •payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA to allow marketing of the new drug product; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA. 
 Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage, including in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity and long-term toxicity studies may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their voluntary informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine, among other things, whether human research subjects will be exposed to

unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In these cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls areas. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not be allowed to proceed, while other protocols may be allowed. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical trial may only resume after the FDA has so notified the sponsor. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the clinical trial can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements, including GCP requirements, of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, the protocol, or other requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study.
Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur for many reasons, including if the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board, or we determine that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on factors such as evolving business objectives and/or the competitive environment.
Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries, as well.
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of registrational clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies that do not conflict with registrational trials. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application.

When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product, the FDA will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
There is no obligation for a sponsor to make its drug products available for expanded access; however, sponsor must make its expanded access policy publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational drug product’s PK and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population.
Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial that is designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a drug, is referred to as “pivotal.”
In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group.
IND annual reports detailing, among other things, the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies. They must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans that contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or grant full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from the requirements of PREA, due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population, and product candidates that have received orphan drug designation are generally exempt from PREA requirements, although orphan-designated drugs intended for treatment of certain molecularly targeted cancer indications are not eligible for the exemption.
 Review and Approval of an NDA
In order to obtain approval to market a drug product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new non-biologic drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. BLAs are submitted for approval of biologic products. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2023 is $3,242,026 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2023 is $393,933. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation, an exception from the program fee when the program does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year and a waiver for certain small businesses.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application, generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt, and strives to inform the sponsor within 74 days whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under certain circumstances, the FDA may determine the application is not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and will issue a refuse to file letter. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for Priority Review are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date may be extended by the FDA to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant, to address a deficiency identified by the FDA in the original submission, or for other reasons.
Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is being or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that review, evaluate and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but the FDA considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review
 The FDA has certain programs designed to expedite the development and review of product candidates intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation. Sponsors must request these designations at appropriate points in the development process.
 The FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interaction with the FDA, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete, in a process called rolling review. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information, and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s PDUFA goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process or for the other reasons.
A product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A product that receives Breakthrough Therapy Designation is eligible for all of the features of Fast Track Designation, and additionally is eligible for intensive guidance throughout the development process and a commitment to involve senior staff.
The FDA may designate a product for Priority Review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A Priority Review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, efficacy biomarker or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with Priority Review.

The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date accelerated approval is granted. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of the product if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS programs can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. The FDA may require a REMS before or after approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, changing manufacturing processes and adding labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Regulation
A sponsor that obtains regulatory approval for marketing of a new product or a new indication for an existing product, will be subject to numerous post-approval regulatory requirements. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information, comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements, and submit NDA annual reports. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors, including those supplying products, ingredients and components, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences may include:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 


•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
In addition, manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notify the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States.
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy or literature for a previously approved drug product, also known as a listed drug. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for which certain investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe and effective “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the listed drug has been approved, subject to any regulatory exclusivities or patents for the listed drug (as further described below), as well as for any new indication or use sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs, known as the reference listed drugs, or RLDs. Abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, the applicant must provide information and data showing that its proposed generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength and conditions of use of the drug. The FDA must also determine whether the generic drug is bioequivalent to the RLD. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the

generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Depending on state laws, generic drugs that are found to be therapeutically equivalent may be automatically substituted for prescriptions for the RLD by the dispensing pharmacist, without the intervention of the prescriber.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any relevant patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book in the same manner as an ANDA applicant.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
•the required patent information has not been filed; 
 •the listed patent has expired; 
 •the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
 •the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
If the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, the expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA may be delayed until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, or, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of an existing regulatory exclusivity or certain patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for an indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Orphan drug exclusivity also may not bar approval of another product under certain specified circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Health Care Law and Regulation
Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the following:

 Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction.
State laws also govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. Many state laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act, or CCPA, establishes data privacy rights for individuals located in California and imposes certain requirements on how businesses can collect and use personal information about such individuals. The California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2023, imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, and establishes a state agency vested with the authority to enforce the CCPA. The CCPA (as amended by the CPRA) has prompted the enactment of similar, comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation in other states. For example, in March 2021, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act (or CDPA), which became effective on January 1, 2023. In July 2021, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act (or CPA), which will become effective on July 1, 2023. Additionally, in March 2022, Utah enacted the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (or UCPA), which will become effective on December 31, 2023. Also, in May 2022, Connecticut signed the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (or CTDPA) into law, which will become effective on July 1, 2023. Furthermore, a number of other U.S. states have proposed similar privacy and data protection legislation, and it is possible that certain of these proposals will pass. Although many of the existing state privacy laws exempt clinical trial information and health information governed by HIPAA, future privacy and data protection laws may be broader in scope. Further, data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may impose additional obligations on the collection, use and other processing of personal information, which may be more stringent or different than those in the United States, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom’s implementation of the same.


Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Health Care Reform
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States.
In 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, included changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; 
 •expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 •established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 70% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% which remains in effect through 2030. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to

several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Specifically, however, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.
Clinical Trial Approval
In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States meaning no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical

trial to a reporting EU Member State through an EU Portal. The submission procedure is the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.
PRIME Designation in the EU
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation where the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies, are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
 Marketing Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under EU regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. We anticipate that the centralized procedure will be mandatory for the product candidates we are developing.
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

The European Commission may grant a so-called “marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances”. Such authorization is intended for products for which the applicant can demonstrate that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, or in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided, or it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Consequently, marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances may be granted subject to certain specific obligations, which may include the following:
•the applicant must complete an identified program of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority, the results of which form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit/risk profile; 
 •the medicinal product in question may be supplied on medical prescription only and may in certain cases be administered only under strict medical supervision, possibly in a hospital and in the case of a radiopharmaceutical, by an authorized person; and 
 •the package leaflet and any medical information must draw the attention of the medical practitioner to the fact that the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 
 A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is subject to annual review to reassess the risk-benefit balance in an annual reassessment procedure. Continuation of the authorization is linked to the annual reassessment and a negative assessment could potentially result in the marketing authorization being suspended or revoked. The renewal of a marketing authorization of a medicinal product under exceptional circumstances, however, follows the same rules as a “normal” marketing authorization. Thus, a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is granted for an initial five years, after which the authorization will become valid indefinitely, unless the EMA decides that safety grounds merit one additional five-year renewal.
The European Commission may also grant a so-called “conditional marketing authorization” prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for product candidates intended for treating, preventing or diagnosing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products), if (i) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data post-authorization, (iii) the product fulfills an unmet medical need and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. A conditional marketing authorization can be converted into a standard centralized marketing authorization (no longer subject to specific obligations) once the marketing authorization holder fulfils the obligations imposed and the complete data confirm that the medicine’s benefits continue to outweigh its risks.
 The EU medicines rules expressly permit the EU Member States to adopt national legislation prohibiting o© restricting the sale, supply or use of any medicinal product containing, consisting of or derived from a specific type of human or animal cell, such as embryonic stem cells. While the products we have in development do not make use of embryonic stem cells, it is possible that the national laws in certain EU Member States may prohibit or restrict us from commercializing our products, even if they have been granted an EU marketing authorization.
Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The

holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
Data and Market Exclusivity
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State for a nationally authorized product. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State for a nationally authorized product within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Paediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Paediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the peopulationopulation are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires, even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Products receiving orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no “similar medicinal product” may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is

intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU where an agreed pediatric investigation plan for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: (1) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five (5) in ten thousand (10,000) persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3)there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
•Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
 •The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. 
 •The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU. 
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 General Data Protection Regulation
The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. Following the United Kingdom’s, or UK’s, withdrawal from the EU, or Brexit, the EU GDPR has been incorporated into UK laws, or UK GDPR (together with the EU GDPR, GDPR). The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, ensuring certain accountability measures are in place and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU and the UK, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The

GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and the EU and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). Except in respect of the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, the regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently largely aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
Despite Brexit, the EU and UK GDPR remain largely aligned. Currently, the most impactful point of divergence relates to transfer mechanisms (i.e., the ability for EU/UK companies to transfer personal information to third countries, including the United States), because it requires us to implement a variety of different contractual clauses approved by EU or UK regulators. There may be further divergence in the future, including with regard to administrative burdens. The UK has announced plans to reform the country’s data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill, which will introduce significant changes from the EU GDPR.
 Pricing Decisions for Approved Products
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, EU Member States have the option to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense.
As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States, can further reduce prices. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs. Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results-based rules of reimbursement may apply. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU Member States have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers.

 Our Mission & Our Employees
 We launched with a bold vision to change the course of genetically defined diseases by treating them at their root cause. Our approach to drug discovery generates significant insights into disease biology and allows us to think creatively about the best way to modulate and balance gene expression. Our patient-focused product engine, FulcrumSeek, is designed to systematically identify and validate cellular drug targets that can modulate gene expression to treat the known root cause of genetically defined diseases. We take great pride in being purposeful patient partners who do this work, not just for patients, but with patients.
We view our employees as one of our most valuable assets in serving our mission. We believe that our future success is dependent on attracting, motivating and retaining talented employees.
