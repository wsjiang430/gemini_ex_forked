Item 1. Business.
Company Overview

We operate in the following four segments: (i) construction; (ii) medical; (ii) real estate development; and (iv) environmental.  The construction segment designs and constructs modular structures built in our factories using raw materials that are Made-in-America.  In the medical segment we use our modular technology to offer turnkey solutions to medical testing and treatment and generating revenue from medical testing. Our real estate development segment builds innovative and green single or multifamily projects in underserved regions nationally using modules built in one of our vertically integrated factories. The environmental segment, the newest segment, is a sustainable medical and waste management solution that has a patented technology to collect waste and treat waste for safe disposal.
We are a provider of modular facilities (“Modules”). We currently provide Modules made out of both code-engineered cargo shipping containers and wood for use as both permanent or temporary structures for residential housing use and commercial use, including for health care facilities. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modules we supplied were primarily for retail, restaurant and military use and were manufactured by third party suppliers using our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise, which modifies code-engineered cargo shipping containers and purpose-built modules for use for safe and sustainable commercial, industrial and residential building. Since our acquisition in September 2020 of Echo DCL, LLC (“Echo”), one of our key supply chain providers, we now have more control over the manufacturing process and have increased our product offerings to add Modules made out of wood.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. In February 2023, we entered into an agreement with The Peoples Health Care, in Glendale, California, working in conjunction with Teamsters Local 848, to deliver four Modules to provide medical services to union members. During 2021, through our subsidiary, Safe and Green Development Corporation. (“SG DevCorp”) we also began to focus on acquiring property to build multi-family housing communities that allows us to utilize the manufacturing services of SG Echo. Our newest subsidiary, SG Environmental Solutions Corp. (“SG Environmental”), formed in Delaware is focused on biomedical waste removal and will utilize a patented technology that it licenses to shred and disinfect biomedical waste, rendering the waste disinfected, unrecognizable, and of no greater risk to the public health than residential household waste
Our ModulesPrior to October 2019, our business model was solely a project-based construction model pursuant to which we were responsible for the design and construction of finished products that incorporated our Modules primarily to customers in the retail, restaurant, military and education industries throughout the United States. In October 2019, we changed our business modelfor our residential building construction to a royalty fee model and entered into a five-year exclusive license with CPF GP 2019-1 LLC (“CPF”) under which CPF licensed on an exclusive basis our proprietary technology and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products in the United States (and its territories) for residential use, including, without limitation, single-family residences and multi-family residences, but excluding military housing. On June 15, 2021, we terminated the exclusive license by mutual agreement and ceased our royalty fee model.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our core customer base was comprised of architects, landowners, builders and developers who use our Modules in commercial and residential structures. Our cargo modified Modules allow for the redesign, repurpose and conversion of heavy-gauge steel cargo shipping containers into Safe & Green™, which are safe green building blocks for commercial, industrial, and residential building construction, rather than consuming new steel and lumber. Our technology and expertise is also used to purpose-build modules, or prefabricated steel modular units customized for use in modular construction (“SGPBMs” and, together with Safe & Green™, “Modules”), primarily to augment or complement an Safe & Green™ structure.
On June 15, 2021, we terminated that certain Exclusive License Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2019 (the “License Agreement”), with CPF, pursuant to which we had granted CPF an exclusive license solely within the United States and its legal territories to our technology, intellectual property, any improvements thereto, and any related permits, in order to develop and commercialize products within the field of design and project management platforms for residential use, including single-family residences and multi-family residences, but excluding military.  In connection with the termination of the License, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the "Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement") with CPF, and Capital Plus Financial, LLC (“Capital Plus”), a limited partner of CPF, pursuant to which the License Agreement was terminated, we released CPF and CPF MF 2019-1 LLC (“CPF MF”) for any claims in exchange for releases from CPF and Capital Plus and we received an assignment of CPF’s right under certain circumstances to a $1.25 million redemption distribution from CPF MF under its Operating Agreement. We and Paul Galvin previously made loans to CPF in the principal amount of $650,000 and $100,000 evidenced by promissory notes pursuant to the terms of a certain Loan Agreement. The loans are unaffected by the Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement and remain in effect and outstanding in accordance with the terms of the notes evidencing such loans.
Under the License Agreement, during the initial term, CPF had agreed to pay us a royalty of (i) five percent (5%) on the first $20,000,000 of gross revenues derived from CPF’s commercialization of the license (net of customary discounts, sales taxes, delivery charges, and amounts for returns) (the “Gross Revenues”), (ii) four and one-half percent (4.5%) on the next $30,000,000 of Gross Revenues, and (iii) five percent (5%) on all Gross Revenues thereafter (collectively, the “Royalty”), subject to the following minimum royalty payments determined on a cumulative basis during the initial term: $500,000 in year 1, $750,000 in year 2, $1,500,000 in year 3, $2,000,000 in year 4, and $2,500,000 in year 5. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not receive any royalty payments under the License Agreement.  

On October 3, 2019, we had entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the “Loan Agreement”) with CPF, which was amended on October 15, 2019 and further amended on November 7, 2019, pursuant to which we agreed to loan CPF $750,000 at an annual interest rate of five percent (5%), with a maturity date of July 31, 2023. Under the Loan Agreement, as amended, we agreed to advance to CPF the first installment of the principal amount, equal to $500,000, no later than January 31, 2020 and the second installment of the principal amount, equal to $250,000, no later than April 15, 2020. As security for this loan, we received a security interest in all of CPF’s membership interests inCPF MF, a Texas limited liability company of which CPF GP is the general partner. If we failed to fund either principal installment, such failure would have constituted a default under the Loan Agreement and a cross default under the License Agreement. On January 21, 2020, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, CPF issued to us a promissory note in the principal amount of $400,000 (the “Company Note”) and issued to Paul Galvin, our Chairman and CEO, a promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 (the “Galvin Note”). The transaction closed on January 22, 2020, on which date we loaned CPF $400,000 and Mr. Galvin personally loaned CPF $100,000 on behalf of us. The Company Note and Galvin Note bear interest at five percent (5%) per annum, payable, together with the unpaid principal amount of the promissory notes, on the earlier of the July 31, 2023 maturity date or upon the liquidation, redemption sale or issuance of a dividend upon the LLC interests in CPF MF 2019-1 LLC; provided, that the terms of the Galvin Note provide that all interest payments due to Mr. Galvin under the Galvin Note shall be paid directly to, and for the benefit of, our Company.
Modular Construction

The sites we develop will primarily utilize modular construction. Weproduce purpose built pre-fabricated modular structures, for both residential and commercial use, using wood or steel as the base material. We believe that modular construction provides the following benefits:

STRONG | FAST | GREEN 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
●Factory produced modules provide greater quality of construction | ●Modules can be produced in parallel to the local site and civil work to enhance the date of completion | ●Modular construction allows for energy savings and more efficient waste management than traditional construction
●Modules are inspected by a third party engineering firm to meet or exceed all applicable building codes | ●Projects can save up to 50% on speed to market in comparison to traditional construction | ●Less site disturbance and impact on local traffic 
●Less weather related damage to construction materials | | 


In cases where modular construction is not advantageous, SG DevCorp. will utilize other construction methods. In the case of building manufacturing facilities, for example, SG DevCorp. expects to work with a team of third-party architects, engineers and construction management firms with deep experience in developing industrial sites to build out such facilities.
Products Produced with Our GreenSteel™ Modular Technology

The building products developed with our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise are generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. The use of the Safe & Green building structure typically provides between four to six points towards the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification levels, including reduced site disturbance, resource reuse, recycled content, innovation in design and use of local and regional materials. Due to our ability to satisfy such requirements, we believe the products produced utilizing our technology and expertise is a leader in environmentally sustainable construction.

There are three core product offerings that utilize our involves GreenSteel technology and engineering expertise. The first product offering involves GreenSteel Modules, which are the structural core and shell of a Safe & Green building. We procure the containers, engineer required openings with structural steel enforcements, paint the containers and then deliver them on-site, where the customer or a customer’s general contractor will complete the entire finish out and installation. The second product offering involves replicating the process to create the GreenSteel product and, in addition, installing selected materials, finishes and systems (including, but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing system) and delivering Safe & Green pre-fabricated containers to the site for a third party licensed general contractor to complete the final finish out and installation. Finally, the third product offering is the completely fabricated and finished Safe & Green building (including but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing systems), including erecting the final unit on site and completing any other final steps. The building is ready for occupancy and/or use as soon as installation is completed. Construction administration and/or project management services are typically included in our product offerings.

Other Modular Products

We also produce pre-fabricated modular containers, for both residential and commercial use, at SG Echo using wood as the base material instead of steel containers. We have found that many clients prefer a mix of wood and steel containers for their projects, wood for aesthetics and cost-savings, and steel for stability and durability.  Since our acquisition of Echo, approximately 75% of our Module sales have been for wood-based modules. 

ESR Approval
In April 2017, the ICC Evaluation Service, LLC (“ICC-ES”) granted us an Evaluation Service Report (“ESR”) for the Safe & Green structural building materials. We believe we are the first modular building company to receive such certification. Our ESR indicates that the ICC-ES recognizes the suitability and technical capabilities of the Safe & Green structural building materials for use in compliance with the International Building Code and Residential Code, the California Building Code and Residential Code, and the Florida Building Code—Building and Residential. We believe our ESR has expedited reviews and approvals by state and local building departments, helped the Safe & Green concept gain wider acceptance in the construction industry and opened up licensing opportunities internationally We also believe the ESR will make it more difficult for other companies in the industry to compete with us because the quality control and design acceptance criteria are specific to us and our associated facilities.

Our ESR is site-specific; therefore, only the inspected and approved facilities can place the ICC-ES mark on the containers. We currently source or fabricate our Safe & Green from 18 facilities located throughout the continental United States. The ICC-ES has currently approved six of these facilities to place the ICC-ES medallion and we will seek ICC-ES approval for additional facilities on an as needed basis. Each of these facilities undergo an annual inspection by ICC-ES. Currently, each of these facilities has been re-certified by ICC-ES and is current with their recertifications. All Safe & Green manufactured at these facilities have an ESR medallion that validates the quality control process. Because our ESR does not cover SGPBMs, this certification does not extend to buildings constructed using SGPBMs.

Safe & Green Medical
In March 2020, we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. In May 2020, we entered into a joint development agreement with Grimshaw Design to assist with the deployment of our D-Tec suite of prefabricated health facilities for on-site immediate COVID-19 testing.
On August 27, 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement (the “Clarity Mobile Venture”) with Clarity Labs Solutions, LLC, a CLIA-certified laboratory based in Miami, Florida (“Clarity Labs”). Under the Clarity Mobile Venture, we, along with Clarity Labs agreed to jointly market, sell, and distribute certain lab testing products and services On November 12, 2020, Clarity Mobile Venture entered into a contract with the City of Los Angeles for the operations of a COVID-19 PCR Test Laboratory at Los Angeles International Airport ("LAX") to provide a full-service modular COVID-19 laboratory and testing facility onsite at Los Angeles International Airport. This facility conducted PCR tests with results available within three hours for passengers and airline crew, and no later than 24 hours for LAX airport employees. In September 2022, we terminated the Clarity Mobile Venture by mutual agreement. For the year-ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized approximately $11,600,000 and $31,500,000, respectively, in revenue related to activities through these joint ventures, which is included in medical revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In February 2023, we entered into an agreement with The Peoples Health Care, a non-profit organization, based in Glendale, California, working in conjunction with Teamsters Local 848, to deliver on or before the end of the second quarter of 2023 four (4) full mobile medical modules to provide medical services consistent with industry standards. We are engaged in negotiations with third-party subcontractors to serve as the clinical operator and staffer of the medical modules providing union members with general wellness, point-of-care medicine, and primary care. Amenities are expected to include, but are not limited to, general wellness, vaccines and testing, specialist referrals, urgent care, imaging and pathological diagnostics, and pharmacy services.

SG Echo
In September 2020, we consummated the transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement that SG Echo entered into with Echo DCL, LLC pursuant to which Echo acquired substantially all the assets of Echo DCL, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, except for Echo DCL, LLC’s real estate holdings. SG Echo is a container/modular manufacturer based in Durant, Oklahoma specializing in the design and construction of permanent modular and temporary modular buildings and was one of our key supply chain partners. SG Echo catered to the military, education, administration facilities, healthcare, government, commercial and residential customers. This acquisition has allowed us to expand our reach for our Modules and has offered us an opportunity to vertically integrate a large portion of our cost of goods sold, as well as increase margins, productivity and efficiency in the areas of design, estimating, manufacturing and delivery. We intend to construct many of the planned developments using Modules built by SG Echo.
Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the transaction we paid to Echo DCL, LLC an aggregate of $1,059,600 in cash, subject to the escrow of certain of the purchase price funds, and SG Echo agreed to pay certain of Echo DCL, LLC’s indebtedness, including the obligation to (i) satisfy a Guidance Line of Credit loan (“GLOC Loan”) in the principal amount of approximately $616,000 ($316,432 of which payoff proceeds were delivered by SG Echo to Echo DCL, LLC at the closing), (ii) pay the debt service on certain of Echo DCL, LLC’s indebtedness in the approximate principal amount of $1.7 million for 12 months following the closing, (iii) pay the monthly principal and interest due under the BTH Credit Line in the principal amount of $500,000 for 12 months following the closing and if Echo DCL, LLC has not fully satisfied the outstanding principal and interest due under the BTH Credit Line and caused the BTH lender to release and terminate any encumbrances on the assets arising out of the BTH Credit Line, SG Echo has the right to pay the outstanding principal and interest due, and (iv) pay earn out payments equal to the net income received from the acquired business during the 3-month period beginning on the first day of the first full month that is 3 months after the closing date, the 3-month period following the first earn out period and the 3-month period following the second earn out period, payable in 50% in cash and 50% in shares of our common stock to be valued a $2.50 per share; provided, that up to approximately $300,000 of any amounts paid in respect of the GLOC Loan, and any amounts paid in respect of the debt service on Echo’s indebtedness and line of credit with BTH Bank, as described in subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, shall be offset against and reduce the earnout payments due to Echo DCL, LLC. In no event may the number of shares of common stock to be issued to Echo DCL, LLC exceed 19.99% of our outstanding shares on the date of the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, no earn out payments have been issued to Echo DCL, LLC.
In July 2022, SG Echo entered into a fabrication agreement with Moliving Inc., the world’s first luxury nomadic hospitality solution. The fabrication agreement is expected to generate approximately $15 million in revenue for an initial 60 units, all of which will be sent to Moliving’s Hurley House location, an eco- resort located in the Hudson Valley area.
In August 2022, SG Echo executed an agreement with People First Industries, an Oklahoma non-profit corporation to construct an approximately 4,550 square feet, 6-module office building and facility. People First Industries’ is an Oklahoma State Use Program and works to empower individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
SG Environmental
In March 2022, we entered into a ten-year exclusive distribution agreement with Sanitec Industries LLC (“Sanitec”), a sustainable waste management company that is the global patent holder for the Sanitec Microwave Healthcare Waste Disinfection System™ for the State of New York with a right to expand to other states. The Sanitec Microwave Disinfection Unit is designed to shred and disinfect biomedical waste, rendering the waste disinfected, unrecognizable, and of no greater risk to the public health than residential household waste. Sanitec Industries existing customers are primarily centered in healthcare facilities nationwide, ranging from large hospital systems to single practitioner doctors’ offices. In connection with our entry into the Sanitec distribution agreement we formed a new subsidiary, SG Environmental Solutions Corp.
SG Development
During February 2021, we formed SG DevCorp. for the purpose of real property development utilizing our technologies and our manufacturing facility. SG DevCorp.’s current business focus is primarily on the direct acquisition and indirect investment in properties nationally that will be further developed in the future into green single or multi-family projects. To date, SG DevCorp. has not generated any revenue and its activities have consisted solely of the acquisition of three properties and an investment in two entities that have acquired two properties to be further developed; however it has not yet commenced any development activities. SG DevCorp. intends to construct many of its planned developments using Modules built by SG Echo. In addition to these development projects, it intends, subject to its ability to raise sufficient capital, to build additional, strategically placed manufacturing facilities that will be sold or leased to third parties as well as leased to SG Echo. SG DevCorp. intends to build manufacturing sites for lease to SG Echo near its project sites in order to take advantage of cost savings for transportation of modules. SG DevCorp.’s business model is flexible and we anticipate developing properties on its own and also through joint ventures in which we partner with third-party equity investors or other developers.


SG DevCorp. has entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which it would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the property owned directly by such joint ventures. The decision to either develop a property on its own or through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by the seller of land; (ii) SG DevCorp.’s desire to diversify its portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) its desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) its projections, in some circumstances, that it will achieve higher returns on its invested capital or reduce its risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and SG DevCorp.’s ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in its sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.

SG DevCorp. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and Information Statement on Form 10 for the separation of SG DevCorp. from SG Holdings into two separate publicly traded companies. To implement the separation, we plan to distribute 30% of the outstanding shares of common stock of SG DevCorp. to our stockholders on a pro rata basis as a distribution (the “Separation and Distribution”). The Separation and Distribution is intended, among other things, to enable the management of the two companies to pursue opportunities for long-term growth and profitability unique to each company’s business and to allow each business to more effectively implement its own distinct capital structure and capital allocation strategies.

Our Board believes that, following the Separation and Distribution, the combined value of our common stock and SG DevCorp.’s common stock could, over time and assuming similar market conditions, be greater than the value of our common stock had the Separation and Distribution not occurred. As a combined company, we have no exact peers, which our Board believes causes the market to undervalue the combined company. With two separate public companies having distinct business models and investment characteristics, investors will have the opportunity to value each against distinct sets of peers and investment metrics. This has the potential to increase the overall valuation of the companies, thus unlocking stockholder value. The increased market value of the common stock of each company should provide additional flexibility for each company to pursue its business strategy.
Current Projects/Development Sites
Lago Vista-On May 10, 2021, SG DevCorp. acquired a 50+ acre site in Lago Vista, Texas for $3,500,000, paid in cash, pursuant to the Unimproved Property Contract, dated February 25, 2021, with Northport Harbor LLC. The acquired parcel sits on Lake Travis on the Colorado River in central Texas. The property is listed for sale. SG DevCorp. acquired the property and were able to successfully get a PDD approved for 174 condominium units, which was further amended to include the option of building rental units on the property. As a result of obtaining the site approval and market conditions, the property’s value increased significantly from the time of purchase. Accordingly, SG DevCorp. determined to list the undeveloped property for sale.
On July 14, 2021, SG DevCorp. issued a Real Estate Lien Note, dated July 14, 2021, in the principal amount of $2.0 million (the “Note”), secured by a Deed of Trust, dated July 14, 2021, on the Lake Travis project site in Lago Vista, Texas and a related Assignment of Leases and Rents, dated July 8, 2021, for net loan proceeds of $1,958,233 after fees. The Note had a term of one (1) year, provided for payments of interest only at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and could be prepaid without penalty commencing nine (9) months after its issuance date. If the Note was prepaid prior to nine (9) months after its issuance date, a 0.5% prepayment penalty would be due. This Note was initially extended until January 14, 2023 and was further extended until February 1, 2024 with an interest rate of twelve and a half (12.5%) per annum. In addition, on September 8, 2022, we issued a Second Lien Note in the principal amount of $500,000 (the “Second Note,” and collectively with the Note, the “Notes”) also secured by a Deed of Trust on the Lake Travis project site in Lago Vista, Texas. This Second Lien provides for payments of interest only at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and originally matured on January 14, 2023, which maturity date was extended until February 1, 2024 with an interest rate of twelve and a half (12.5%) per annum. SG DevCorp. intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the property for its other development projects. On March 30, 2023, an affiliate of SG DevCorp. entered into an agreement to secure financing to pay off the Notes by issuing a new $5,000,000 note to be secured by the Lago Vista property and SG DevCorp.’s McLean site in Durant, Oklahoma. As of the date of this report, the financing to pay off the Notes had not closed.

Norman Berry Village - On May 31, 2021, SG DevCorp. acquired a 50% membership interest for $600,000 in a limited liability company , Norman Berry II Owners, LLC (“NB Owners”), that is building affordable housing in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area to be known as “Norman Berry Village”. SG DevCorp. has partnered with CMC Development Group, a New York City-based real estate development firm (“CMC”) with national expertise providing design build services. CMC owns the other 50% membership interest in NB Owners. The NB Owners’ operating agreement provides that NB Owners will initially have two managers, one designated by CMC (the “CMC Manager”) and one designated by us. Pursuant to the operating agreement, the CMC Manager will manage the day-to-day business and affairs of NB Owners and all non-routine decisions requires the approval of members owning a majority of the outstanding membership interests. The operating agreement also provides that any fee earned by CMC in connection with the acquisition and development of the Norman Berry Village and related real property will be split 75% to CMC and 25% to us. SG DevCorp. has no obligation under the operating agreement to make any additional capital contributions to NB Owners. In addition, neither SG DevCorp. nor CMC may voluntarily make any additional capital contributions to NB Owners. In accordance with the operating agreement, we are entitled to a preferred return equal to 10% per annum on our unreturned capital contributions which return will (i) accrue from the date on which our capital contributions were actually contributed to NB Owners until the date such capital contributions are returned to SG DevCorp. , and (ii) compound annually. expect the project to develop 125,000 square feet of space and build approximately 132 multi-family rental apartments in two buildings. SG DevCorp. expects the project to commence in the first quarter of 2024, subject to available funding, and to be completed within three years of commencement for estimated development costs for this project is approximately $35 million dollars.

Cumberland Inlet-On June 24, 2021, SG DevCorp., as member, entered into an Operating Agreement, with Jacoby Development, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“JDI”), as manager, dated June 24, 2021 (the “Operating Agreement”), for JDI-Cumberland Inlet, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (“JDI-Cumberland”), pursuant to which SG DevCorp. acquired a 10% non-dilutable equity interest (“LLC Interest”) in JDI-Cumberland and agreed to contribute $3,000,000 in capital to it for the development of a 1,400 acre waterfront parcel in downtown historic St. Marys, Georgia (the “Project”). SG DevCorp. in conjunction with Jacoby Development of Atlanta, Georgia expects to develop a mixed-use destination community. JDI-Cumberland has purchased a 1,298 acre waterfront parcel in downtown historic St. Marys, Georgia and expects to develop approximately 352 acres thereof (the “Cumberland Project”). SG DevCorp., in conjunction with JDI, expect to develop a mixed-use destination community. The location will serve as home to 3,500 units made up of single family, multi-family, vacation and hospitality use, as well as a full-service marina, village, and upscale Eco-Tourism park inclusive of camping, yurts, cabins and cottages.

SG DevCorp. has no obligation under the Operating Agreement to make any additional capital contributions to JDI-Cumberland. The Operating Agreement provides JDI with the right, at its option, to purchase the LLC Interest from SG DevCorp. on or before June 24, 2023 for $3.0 million, plus an amount equal to an annual internal rate of return (IRR) on such funds of forty (40%) percent (i.e., $1.2 million annualized). After June 24, 2023, the Operating Agreement provides JDI with the right, at its option, to purchase the LLC Interest from us for $3.0 million, plus an amount equal to an IRR of thirty-two and one-half (32.5%) percent (i.e., $975,000 annualized). The Operating Agreement also provides that if JDI receives a good faith, bona fide written offer from an unaffiliated third party to purchase all or any portion of the Project, JDI shall first offer the Project to us at the same price and upon substantially the same terms as are contained in the offer. The Operating Agreement contains certain protective provisions that prevent JDI, as manager, from determining to, or taking, certain significant actions without our consent. SG Echo, a subsidiary of SG Holdings, entered into a Fabrication and Building Services Agreement (“Building Services Agreement”) with JDI-Cumberland to design, fabricate and install various improvements for the Project using modular structures, pursuant to budgets prepared by SG Echo submitted for approval to JDI-Cumberland, including a marina, town center, apartments and single family units, townhomes, commercial, retail and lodging buildings/structures, eco-tourism park, camping yurts, cabins and cottages. The Building Services Agreement has an initial term of three years, with two-year automatic renewal provisions. During the term of the Building Services Agreement, SG Echo will have a right of first refusal with respect to each phase of the construction of the project buildings. If SG Echo’s quote for a given phase is no more than five percent more than the average of all bona fide, arm’s length bids that JDI-Cumberland obtains from reputable, unaffiliated builders, the phase will be awarded to SG Echo. In the event that SG Echo’s quote for a given phase is more than five percent more than the average of all bona fide arm’s length bids JDI-Cumberland obtains from reputable, unaffiliated builders, SG Echo will have the right to match such best bona fide, arm’s length offers and secure the work.

SG DevCorp. anticipates that the first phase of development activities at this site will be the construction of 165 multifamily units over the course of 12-18 months, which activities are anticipated to commence during the third quarter of 2023, with an estimated cost of $38 million. SG DevCorp. also anticipates that the units will be built with modules supplied by SG Echo. Current plans are to sell this development three (3) years after development.

McLean Mixed Use Site-On November 10, 2021 SG DevCorp. entered into a Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement) with the Durant Industrial Authority to acquire 100% ownership of approximately 114 mixed-use acres in Durant, Oklahoma for $865,000. In February 2022, SG DevCorp. closed on and acquired the 114 acre site. SG DevCorp. anticipates building approximately 800 residential units and up to 1,100,000 square feet of industrial manufacturing space on the mixed-use property. SG DevCorp. plans to build and SG Echo will occupy a 120,000 square foot state of the art manufacturing facility. The property is zoned for an additional 1.0 million square feet of industrial space. SG DevCorp. is currently marketing the additional space to potential tenants. On December 2, 2022, SG DevCorp. entered into a Fabrication Agreement (the “Fabrication Agreement”) with SG Echo for the fabrication of approximately 800 multifamily market rate rental units, equal to approximately 800,000 square feet of new modular buildings to be located at the McLean site (the “Project”). The Fabrication Agreement provides that SG Echo will be paid a fee equal to 15% of the cost of the Project. SG DevCorp.’s obligations under the Fabrication Agreement are subject to it securing third party financing for the Project.

SG DevCorp. anticipates that the first phase of development activities at this site will be the construction of 100 multifamily units over the course of 12-18 months, which activities are anticipated to commence during the third quarter of 2023, with an estimated cost of $17 million. It also anticipates that the units will be built with modules supplied by SG Echo. Current plans are to sell this development three (3) years after development.
St. Marys Industrial Site-On August 18, 2022, SG DevCorp. acquired for $296,870 approximately 33 acres of land adjacent to the Project described below from the Camden County Joint Development Authority (JDA). SG DevCorp. plans to build a 120,000 square foot state of the art manufacturing facility which will be occupied by SG Echo. This facility will service not only the Project, but also the Southeastern region. In connection with the purchase of the St. Marys Industrial Site, SG DevCorp. entered into a promissory note in the amount of $148,300. This note has a maturity date of September 1, 2023, subject to SG DevCorp.’s right to extend for 6 months upon payments of a fee equal to 1% of the principal balance of the note and provides for payments of interest only at a rate of nine and three quarters percent (9.75%) per annum. This note could be prepaid without penalty, provided, however, if the lender has not received six months of interest, SG DevCorp. must pay the lender an amount equivalent to the months of interest necessary to complete six months of interest. In addition, at the time of payment in full of the note, SG DevCorp. must pay the lender an amount equivalent to half of one percent (0.50%) of the original loan amount. To secure payment in full of the note, the note is secured by a security deed in the property with power of the lender to sell the property.

SG DevCorp. anticipates that of development activities at this site will commence during the second quarter of 2023 and continue for 12-18 months, with an estimated cost of $17 million. It also anticipates that the units will be built with modules supplied by SG Echo. We also anticipate that the units will be built with modules supplied by SG Echo. Current plans are to sell this development three (3) years after development.

In December 2022, we entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 25 acres in Denison, Texas. We intend to design and create an active senior living community with various amenities on the site at an expected total development cost of approximately $115 million. The profits from the project over 5 years are estimated at $40 million. The 496 homes will also create what we believe to be close to $80 million of construction for SG Echo, with anticipated $15 million in margin to our manufacturing campus. We expect to close on the purchase of the property in the second quarter of 2023.

Our Competitive Strengths

Although the construction industry is highly competitive, we are committed to educating the real estate community on the benefits of our technology and expertise and positioning the products that utilize our technology and expertise as complementary to the strategy of developers, rather than as competition. We may compete for building opportunities with regional, national and international builders that possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and competition within the general construction industry may increase if there is future consolidation in the land development and construction industry or from new building technologies that could arise. Within the modular building space, we compete against a small number of companies providing modular-building services. The principal competitive factors in our construction business include, but are not limited to, the availability of building materials; technical product knowledge and expertise; previous experience in modular construction; consulting or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and the marketability of our ESR within the structural building space.

We believe we can distinguish ourselves from our competitors on the basis of our ESR, quality, cost and construction time savings when utilizing our technology and expertise. Our proprietary construction for our cargo based containers method is typically less expensive than traditional construction methods, particularly in urban locations and multi-story projects, and construction time is also generally reduced by using our construction method, reducing both construction and soft costs substantially. Safe & Green are designed to be hurricane-, tornado- and earthquake-resistant and able to withstand harsh climate conditions. The flexibility and the stack-ability of the Modules allows architects, developers and owners to design Modules to meet their specific needs. In addition, our management team has a breadth of knowledge in the modular building industry with a combined 130 years of experience. Our experience in a wide range of construction applications, including office, enclosures, residential, commercial, quick service restaurants, experiential and restaurant applications, gives us an advantage over our competition through the use of market-based prototypes. With the acquisition of Echo, we have been able to vertically integrate our manufacturing process and reduce some of our cost of goods sold, productivity and efficiency.

Our Customers

We market our construction products to a broad customer base, comprised primarily of contractors, home builders, building owners and other resellers across the continental United States and we also market our services and technology to customers in Canada.   In addition, as stated above, we have supplied and offer our Modules to the medical community. Safe & Green customers come from all walks in the economy and include government agencies, private developers, the U.S. Military, the Native American Community, the QSR operators, individuals and families requiring COVID-19 tests and a host of entrepreneurs looking to launch ideas and technology. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 80% and 78%, respectively, of the Company’s gross accounts receivable were due from three and four customers. Revenue relating to three and one customers represented approximately 65% and 80% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Our Suppliers and Partners

Although the primary use of shipping containers is for transportation, when constructing Safe & Green, we use standard materials made in America to modify the container shell structure and finish out the modules. In addition, we use the same standard construction materials to construct and finish out the wood base modules produced at SG Echo. We utilize the same suppliers and materials used by conventional construction. Materials such as windows, doors, insulation mechanical systems, electrical systems and other such supplies are all off-the-shelf materials and equipment commonly available and used in the industry. We believe we have access to alternative suppliers, with limited disruption to the business, should circumstances change with our existing suppliers.
Intellectual Property

We operate under our United States registered trademarks "Safe & Green" and “GreenSteel” and our trademarked “SG” logo.  

Government Regulation and Approval

The design and construction of buildings is controlled at the project level, with local and state municipalities having jurisdiction in most cases. All buildings, conventionally built or modularly built, are subject to published building codes and criteria that must be achieved during the architectural and engineering phase in order to be approved for construction. There are no specific regulations that impact our design and construction technology. While much of the regulation in our industry occurs at the project level, we are subject to various federal, state and local government regulations applicable to the business in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. Also, to the extent we expand into medical waste removal and medical testing we will be subject to various federal, state and local government regulations. We strive to operate in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and, in addition, that our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices comply with related regulations. 
General Corporate Information

Our Emergence from Bankruptcy

On October 15, 2015, SGB and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption In re SG Blocks, Inc. et al., Case No. 15-12790. On February 29, 2016, the Debtors filed a Disclosure Statement (the “Disclosure Statement”), attaching a Plan of Reorganization (the “Reorganization Plan”), along with a motion seeking approval of the Disclosure Statement by the Bankruptcy Court. On June 30, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Reorganization Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.
Prior to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue: (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Common Stock”) of which 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016; and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Preferred Stock”), none of which were issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date.

On the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016, pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to Hillair Capital Investments L.P. (“HCI”) in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the “Exit Facility”). 

On the Effective Date, all previously issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 8,195 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split) of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “New Common Stock”), to the holders of Former Common Stock. Further, under the Reorganization Plan, upon the Effective Date, certain members of SGB’s management were entitled to receive options (the “Management Options”) to acquire approximately 10,919 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split), of SGB’s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis.


On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and SGB’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SGB filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 1,801,670 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split) of preferred stock, par value $1.00, all of which were issued upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Prior to our public offering that we consummated in June 2017, all outstanding shares of our preferred stock, were converted into 90,084 shares of common stock. No preferred stock currently remains outstanding.

Reverse Stock Split
On February 5, 2020, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share amounts set forth in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the split effected in February 2020 as if it had occurred as of the earliest period presented and unless otherwise stated, all other share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split effected in February 2020.
Human Capital
Employees
  We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. As of December 31, 2022, we directly employed fifteen full-time employees and engaged outside professional firms and subcontractors to deliver projects to customers, and SG Echo directly employed seventy full-time employees.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include: 
·         Adding work from home flexibility;
·         Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
·         Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations;
·         Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;

Item1A. Risk Factors.
  Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this Annual Report, including the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements,” and Part II, Item 7.“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.
Risks Relating to our Financial Position and Capital Requirements.

If we are not successful in our efforts to increase sales or raise capital, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months, and our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all, may be limited.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of $582,776 and $13,024,381, respectively. However, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported a net loss of $7,089,242 and $5,908,372, respectively, and used $5,630,614 and $662,759 of cash for operations, respectively. If we are not successful with our efforts to increase revenue, we could experience a shortfall in cash over the next twelve months. If there is a shortfall, we may be forced to reduce operating expenses, among other steps, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our operations going forward.

We may also seek to obtain debt or additional equity financing to meet any cash shortfalls both in the public company or our subsidiaries. The type, timing and terms of any financing we may select will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funds if needed and that, if such funds are available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us, especially in light of the fact that our ability to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is $75 million or more. If we are unable to secure additional financing, further reduction in operating expenses might need to be substantial in order for us to ensure enough liquidity to sustain our operations. Any equity financing would be dilutive to our stockholders. If we incur debt, we will likely be subject to restrictive covenants that significantly limit our operating flexibility and require us to encumber our assets. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures will be significantly limited. Any of the above limitations could force us to significantly curtail or cease our operations, and you could lose all of your investment in our common stock. These circumstances have raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and continued cash losses may risk our status as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.


Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains a note stating that the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents and a short-term investment, collectively, of $582,776 and $13,024,381, respectively. However, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported a net loss of $7,089,242 and $5,908,372, respectively, and used $5,630,614 and $662,759 of cash for operations, respectively.
Until we begin generating sufficient revenue, there is a doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through December 31, 2023.
We have incurred net losses in prior periods, and there can be no assurance that we will generate income in the future, or that we will be able to successfully achieve or maintain our growth strategy.
Our ability to achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to generate and sustain substantially increased revenues. We may continue to incur operating losses in the future as we execute our growth strategy. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered in light of the difficulties facing the construction and real estate development industry as a whole, economic conditions and the competitive environment in which we operate. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties, and we may not achieve sufficient revenues to sustain or increase profitability. In addition, we may be unable to successfully achieve or maintain our growth strategy, including our ability to expand into new geographic markets.
To date we have not generated revenue from SG DevCorp or SG Environmental and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.
In 2021, we formed SG DevCorp. to develop real estate properties and in 2022 we formed SG Environmental to manage waste removal. To date neither subsidiary has generated any revenue from its operations and there can be no assurance that either will do so in the future. Each business is subject to all of the risks associated with a new business.
An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

  As December 31, 2022, we had $1,309,330 of goodwill. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable, include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry. Our annual impairment tests resulted in no impairment of goodwill during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. Deterioration in estimated future cash flows in our reporting unit could result in further future goodwill impairment. Changes to our business strategy, changes in industry or market conditions, changes in operating performance or other indicators of impairment could cause us to record a significant impairment charge during the period in which the impairment is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position.
We will need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be compelled to delay, reduce or eliminate our development or commercialization efforts.

We expect to incur significant development expenses related to SG DevCorp. operations as well as our other operations. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. However, we have estimated our current additional funding needs based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Additionally, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. Additional capital may not be available to us at such times or in the amounts we need. Even if capital is available, it might be available only on unfavorable terms. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, governmental funding, collaborations, strategic partnerships and alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. If access to sufficient capital is not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail one or more product development or commercialization programs, significantly reduce expenses, sell assets, seek a merger, or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors or liquidate all our assets.

Our failure to timely register the shares of our common stock issuable under the Debenture and the Warrant we issued to Peak One Opportunity Fund, L.P. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

On February 7, 2023, we closed a private placement offering of $1,100,000 in principal amount of an 8% convertible debenture (the “Debenture”) and a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase up to Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of the Company’s common stock, with Peak One Opportunity Fund, L.P. (“Peak One”) for gross proceeds of $1,000,000. In connection with the Peak One financing, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Peak One where we agreed to file a registration statement within 60 days to register the shares of common stock issuable under the Debenture and the Warrant with the SEC and to use our reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within 90 calendar days from the closing of the financing. In the event we were to default on our obligation to register the shares of common stock issuable under the Debenture and the Warrant as agreed, Peak One may, among other things, increase the interest rate applicable to the Debenture to the lesser of eighteen percent (18%) per annum and the maximum interest rate allowable under applicable law and accelerate the immediate payment of the full indebtedness due under the Debenture, in an amount equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the then outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest. The acceleration of the Debenture issued to Peak One could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may not have an adequate number of shares of common stock authorized to enable us to complete future equity financing transactions or strategic transactions, which may adversely affect our ability to grow and develop.
We are authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of common stock, of which approximately 12,613,978 shares of common stock are issued and outstanding and there are outstanding options and warrants to purchase 36,436 and 2,025,520 shares of common stock, respectively, in addition to 3,212,504 vested and unvested restricted stock units. If all of these securities were exercised it would leave 7,111,562 authorized but unissued shares of common stock.
As a result of our limited number of our authorized and unissued shares of common stock, we may have insufficient shares of common stock available to issue in connection with any future equity financing transactions or strategic transactions we may seek to undertake. Accordingly, we will likely take steps in the near future to increase our number of available shares, which may include seeking stockholder approval of an increase in our authorized number of shares of common stock or a reverse stock split.


Risks Relating to our Company
Our residential construction business is difficult to evaluate because we changed our business model in June 2021 and have a limited operating history and limited information.
In 2021 we terminated our  licensing business model for our residential construction business in the United States and are currently developing and constructing our own residential developments. In 2019 we had entered into one license agreement for use of our technology for construction of residences in the United States. We terminated this license agreement in June 2021. There is a risk that we will be unable to successfully generate income from our new business model. Although we believe that we will experience increased revenue, there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased costs and generate less income with this new business model than we anticipate. We are subject to many risks associated with currently developing and constructing our own residential developments, such as our dependence upon third parties to provide services and supply required materials. Even if we generate increased revenue as anticipated, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.

Our ability to meet our workforce needs is crucial to our results of operations and future sales and profitability.

  We rely on the existence of an available hourly workforce to manufacture our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified employees to meet current or future manufacturing needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. For instance, the demand for skilled employees has increased recently with the low unemployment rates in Oklahoma where we have manufacturing facilities. Also, although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we cannot assure you that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. Significant increases in manufacturing workforce costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We have a fixed cost base that will affect our profitability if our sales decrease.

  The fixed cost levels of operating SG Echo can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. Our profitability depends, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over a sufficiently large number of products sold and shipped, and if we make a decision to reduce our rate of production, gross or net margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce production can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.

A material disruption at one of our suppliers’ facilities or Echo’s facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively affect our overall financial results.

  Any of the following events could cease or limit operations unexpectedly: fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, on-site or off-site environmental incidents or other catastrophes; global pandemic; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; or war, acts of terrorism or other unexpected events. Any downtime or damage at our suppliers’ facilities or SG Echo’s facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make more expensive purchases from a competing supplier. If our suppliers were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in customers seeking products from other distributors, as well as decreased customer satisfaction and lower sales and operating income.

A natural disaster, the effects of climate change, or other disruptions at our Echo facility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We rely on the continuous operation of our SG Echo facility in Durant, Oklahoma for the production of our Modules. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption to our facility due to fire, flood, earthquake, or any other unforeseen circumstance would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and/or severity of storms, or floods could impair our ability to operate by damaging our facilities and equipment or restricting product delivery to customers. The occurrence of any disruption at our manufacturing facility, even for a short period of time, may have an adverse effect on our productivity and profitability, during and after the period of the disruption. These disruptions may also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage. Although we maintain property, casualty, and business interruption insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary for the industry, we are not fully insured against all potential natural disasters or other disruptions to our manufacturing facility.

The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.

  We are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to continue to maintain our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.

  In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition are more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We are dependent on the services of key personnel, and the unexpected loss of their services may adversely affect our operations.

Our success depends highly upon the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management team, specifically the efforts of Paul M. Galvin, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer and William Rogers, our Chief Operations Officer. The Company has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Galvin and Rogers. The employment agreements with Messrs. Galvin and Rogers each provide for two-year terms, with automatic renewal after the end of such term. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to achieve profitability and generate increased revenue will depend upon our ability to retain, and, if necessary, attract experienced management personnel.
The loss of one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on us.

A few customers have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. At  December 31, 2022 and 2021, 80% and 78%, respectively, of the our gross accounts receivable were due from one and three customers. Revenue relating to two and three customers represented approximately 65% and 80% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although we have contractual relationships with many of our significant customers, our customers may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We rely on certain vendors to supply us with materials and products that, if we were unable to obtain, could adversely affect our business.

We have relationships with key materials vendors, and we rely on suppliers for our purchases of products from them.  Any inability to obtain materials or services in the volumes required and at competitive prices from our major trading partners, the loss of any major trading partner or the discontinuation of vendor financing (if any) may seriously harm our business because we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers on a timely basis in sufficient quantities or at all.  Other factors, including reduced access to credit by our vendors resulting from economic conditions, may impair our vendors’ ability to provide products in a timely manner or at competitive prices.  We also rely on other vendors for critical services such as transportation, supply chain and professional services.  Any negative impacts to our business or liquidity could adversely impact our ability to establish or maintain these relationships. 

We currently are, and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings or investigations, the resolution of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flows in a particular period.
The nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims, including disputes relating to our operations and commercial and contractual arrangements. Often the litigation matters are not totally within our control. We will contest these matters vigorously and will make insurance claims where appropriate, but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. The costs associated with litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability. In addition, our profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation currently pending in the courts or by litigation that may be filed against us in the future. We are also subject to government regulation, which could result in administrative proceedings in the future. For additional information, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

We may have difficulty protecting our proprietary manufacturing processes, which could adversely affect our ability to compete.
We use a proprietary manufacturing process that allows us to be code-compliant in our Safe & Green™ product. Such manufacturing process is unique to the construction industry and is important to ensure our continued success, and we cannot assure you that our efforts to protect our proprietary rights will be sufficient or effective. If other companies replicate our methodology, we could lose our competitive advantage. Any future patent or trademark applications may not lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances. We also cannot be assured that the scope of any patents issued in the future will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. Others may develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, and our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our business and revenue could be materially and adversely affected.

Risks Relating to our Business and Industry
Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, domestic and foreign trade policies, monetary policies and other factors beyond our control may adversely impact our business and operating results.
Our operations and performance depend on global, regional and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. General worldwide economic conditions have experienced significant instability in recent years including the recent global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions. Russia’s invasion and military attacks on Ukraine have triggered significant sanctions from U.S. and European leaders and financial markets around the world experienced volatility following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022. Resulting changes in U.S. trade policy and European policies could trigger retaliatory actions by Russia, its allies and other affected countries, including China, resulting in a “trade war.” Furthermore, if other countries, including the U.S., become further involved in the conflict, we could face significant adverse effects to our business and financial condition.

The uncertain financial markets, disruptions in supply chains, mobility restraints, and changing priorities as well as volatile asset values could impact our business in the future. The COVID-19 outbreak and government measures taken in response to the pandemic have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, have spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, have fallen. The future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain. In addition, the outbreak of a pandemic could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill members of management or other employees, or absenteeism by members of management and other employees who elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or laboratory facilities, or due to quarantines. Pandemics could also impact members of our Board of Directors resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors,and making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.
Further, due to increasing inflation, operating costs for many businesses including ours have increased and, in the future, could impact demand or pricing of our services or services providers, foreign exchange rates or employee wages. Inflation rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to levels not seen in years, and increased inflation may result in increases in our operating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity and limits on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise capital. In addition, the Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks.
Actual events involving reduced or limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver. Although we did not have any cash or cash equivalent balances on deposit with Silicon Valley Bank, uncertainty and liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry remain and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and its potential near- and long-term effects on the biotechnology industry and its participants such as our vendors, suppliers, and investors, may also adversely affect our operations and stock price.
We are actively monitoring the effects these disruptions and increasing inflation could have on our operations.
These conditions make it extremely difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.

We depend on third parties for transportation services, and limited availability or increases in costs of transportation could adversely affect our business and operations.
Our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, via railroad or truck. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture or distribute and for the delivery of our raw materials. We are also subject to seasonal capacity constraints and weather-related delays for both rail and truck transportation. If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us or our Modules to our customers in a timely manner, we may be unable to complete projects in a timely manner and may, among other things, incur penalties for late delivery or be unable to use the Modules as intended. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials to us or finished Modules to our customers in a timely manner could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships, and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could adversely affect our sales, profitability, and cash flows. 
 Expansion of our operations may strain resources, and our failure to manage growth effectively could adversely impact our operating results and  harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel.

Increased orders for our Modules have placed, and may continue to place, a strain on our operational, financial, and managerial resources and personnel. In addition, execution of our growth strategy will require further substantial capital and effective planning. Significant rapid growth on top of our current operations could greatly strain our internal resources, leading to a lower quality of customer service, reporting problems, and delays, resulting in a loss of market share and other problems that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our efforts to grow could place an additional strain on our personnel, management systems, liquidity, and other resources. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our operations could be adversely affected, resulting in slower, no or negative growth, critical shortages of cash and a failure to achieve or sustain profitability.
 
Our clients may adjust, cancel or suspend the contracts in our backlog; as such, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. In addition, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.

Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts we have been awarded. Backlog may fluctuate significantly due to the timing of orders or awards for large projects and is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which backlog will be recognized as revenue.  We include in backlog only those contracts for which we have reasonable assurance that the customer can obtain the permits for construction and can fund the construction. As of December 31, 2021, our backlog totaled approximately $3.2 million and as of December 31, 2022, our backlog totaled approximately $6.8 million. The increase in backlog at December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to one contract in the amount of $5.7 million entered into during 2022. Our backlog is described more in detail in “Note13 —Construction Backlog” of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We cannot provide assurance that our backlog will be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination or suspension at our customer’s discretion. In the event of a project cancellation, we generally would not have a contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. In addition, the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices. 

The contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided and adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. Additionally, our performance of our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and, therefore, our future profitability. We can provide no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce revenues in the amounts currently estimated, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past.

Our liability for estimated warranties may be inadequate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims are common in the construction industry and can be costly. At this time, our third-party providers offer guarantees and warranties in accordance with industry standards that flow through to our clients. A large number of warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We can be adversely affected by failures of persons who act on our behalf to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines.

Although we expect all of our associates (i.e., employees), officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there are instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business may engage in practices that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines.  It is possible that our associates may become aware of these practices but do not take steps to prevent them.  If we learn of practices relating to buildings constructed on our behalf that do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we will move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible, and we will take disciplinary action with regard to our associates who were aware of the practices, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take, we may be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation may be negatively affected.

The cyclical and seasonal nature of the construction industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future.
The construction industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many international, national and regional economic factors, including the availability of consumer and wholesale financing, seasonality of demand, consumer confidence, interest rates, income levels and general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions. As a result of the foregoing factors, the revenues and operating results we derive from customers will fluctuate and we currently expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, operating losses during cyclical downturns in the construction market. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and our financial condition and operating results.

Our business depends on the construction industry and general business, financial market and economic conditions.
The construction industry is cyclical and significantly affected by changes in general and local economic and real estate conditions, such as employment levels, consumer confidence, demographic trends, housing demand, inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. Changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy could negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of our indirect customers and suppliers, and, therefore, our royalty income and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in these economic conditions may affect some of our regions or markets more than others. If adverse conditions affect our larger markets, they could have a proportionately greater impact on us than on some other companies. In addition, any uncertainty regarding global economic conditions such as raising gas prices may have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of us or our customers, distributors and suppliers, such as negative effects of currency exchange fluctuations. A shortage of labor in the construction industry could also have an impact on our financial results.
Ourbusiness relies on private investment and a slower than expected economy may adversely affect our results.
A significant portion of our sales are for projects with non-public owners, such as non-residential builders and home builders who make investments with private funds into their projects. Construction spending is affected by their customers’ ability to finance projects, which may be severely reduced due to rising interest rates. Residential and nonresidential construction could decline if companies and consumers are unable to finance construction projects or if the economy slows or is stalled, which could result in delays or cancellations of capital projects. If the economy slows, or if housing starts and nonresidential projects do not increase, sales of our products directly by us to consumers and related services may decline, and our financial position, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.
A material disruption at one of our suppliers’ facilities or Echo's facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and negatively affect our overall financial results.
Any of the following events could cease or limit operations unexpectedly: fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, on-site or off-site environmental incidents or other catastrophes; global pandemic; utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions; labor difficulties; other operational problems; or war, acts of terrorism or other unexpected events. Any downtime or damage at our suppliers’ facilities or SG Echo's facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products or require us to make more expensive purchases from a competing supplier. If our suppliers were to incur significant downtime, our ability to satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in customers seeking products from other distributors, as well as decreased customer satisfaction and lower sales and operating income.
 
Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things: the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, generation, treatment, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials; and the protection of public and employee health and safety and the environment. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions, even if such actions complied with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for claims of personal injury or property or natural resource damage related to alleged exposure to, or releases of, regulated or hazardous materials. The existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could also result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for purposes of construction materials distribution. In addition, because our properties are generally situated adjacent to or near industrial companies, our properties may be at an increased risk of having environmental contaminants from other properties spill or migrate onto or otherwise affect our properties.

Despite our compliance efforts, there is an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business, especially from an environmental standpoint, and, from time to time, we may be in noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These potential liabilities or non-compliances could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. In some instances, we must have government approvals, certificates, permits or licenses in order to conduct our business, which may require us to make significant capital, operating and maintenance expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to obtain and maintain required approvals, certificates, permits or licenses or to comply with applicable governmental requirements could result in sanctions, including substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some or all of our operations. The cost of complying with such laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Our business may be subject to economic and political risks of operating and obtaining supplies from foreign countries, including adverse impact of changes in international trade and tariff policies.
We operate in and source some of our products from outside of the United States, and our suppliers may also rely upon non-domestic products. As such, any significant changes to, among other things, the general political and social conditions in foreign counties in which we maintain operations or sourcing relationships, unfavorable changes in U.S. trade legislation and regulation, the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or other trade barriers, threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, labor disruptions, currency controls, fluctuating exchange rates with respect to contracts not denominated in U.S. dollars and unanticipated or unfavorable changes in government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflation measures and method of taxation. If we are unable to navigate foreign regulatory environments, or if we are unable to enforce our contract rights in foreign countries, our business could be adversely impacted. Any of these events could interrupt our business and cause operational disruptions, increase our costs of operations, reduce our sales or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.

The U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to trade policy, including, in some instances, to revise, renegotiate or terminate certain multilateral trade agreements. It has also imposed new tariffs on certain foreign goods and raised the possibility of imposing additional increases or new tariffs on other goods. Such actions have, in some cases, led to retaliatory trade measures by certain foreign governments. Such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to do business in or procure products from those countries. In turn, we may need to raise prices or make changes to our operations, which could negatively impact our revenue or operating results. At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the U.S. government or foreign governments with respect to tariff and international trade agreements and policies, and we cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any revised trade agreements or any impact on our business.
Our operating results will be subject to fluctuations and are inherently unpredictable.
In order to achieve profitability, we will need to generate and sustain higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels. In our most recent quarter, we experienced a loss. We do not know if our revenue will grow, or if it will grow sufficiently to outpace our expenses, which we expect to increase as we expand our operational capacity. We may not be able to become profitable on a quarterly or an annual basis. Our quarterly revenue and operating results will be difficult to predict and have in the past fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The amount, timing and mix of project sales, often for a single medium or large-scale project, may cause large fluctuations in our revenue and other financial results. Further, our revenue mix of high margin materials sales versus lower margin projects can fluctuate dramatically quarter to quarter, which may adversely affect our revenue and financial results in any given period. Finally, our ability to meet project completion schedules for an individual project and the corresponding revenue impact under the percentage-of-completion method of recognizing revenue, may similarly cause large fluctuations in our revenue and other financial results. This may cause us to miss any future guidance announced by us.

We base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue, and a significant portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term. If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results for that quarter. This may cause us to miss any guidance announced by us. 
 Cybersecurity risks related to the technology used in our operations and other business processes, as well as security breaches of company, customer, employee and vendor information, could adversely affect our business.
We rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store and report data and interact with customers, vendors and employees. Despite careful security and controls design, as the prevalence of cyber-attacks continues to increase, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to increased security threats, such as phishing and malware incidents. Our security measures may be unable to prevent certain security breaches, and any such network, system, data or other breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data, transactional errors, theft of funds, business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property, loss of customers and business opportunities, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential or personal information (which could cause a breach of applicable data protection legislation), regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs and additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, information technologies systems change frequently, and may not be recognized until after they have been launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any breach in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the development and maintenance of preventative or detective measures is costly, and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to circumvent security measures become more sophisticated. As well as incurring additional costs, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the systems, or we may be unable to successfully integrate and launch new systems as planned without disruptions to our operations. Misuse of internal applications, theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, funds or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. 
Despite our efforts, we remain potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks and security breaches, and any such attack or breach could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if we are unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.

At December 31, 2022, we had tax net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately $30.2 million. The net operating loss expires beginning 2030 through 2037 for those losses generated in 2017 and prior years. Approximately $18 million of such net operating losses will carry forward indefinitely and be available to offset up to 80% of future taxable income each year. During 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was passed, which temporarily removes such 80% limitation for years 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $9.7 million, primarily related to net operating loss carry forwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized due to an inability to carry back these losses in most states and short carry forward periods that exist in certain states. If we are unable to use our net operating losses, we may be required to record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Risks Relating to the Construction Sector

We are dependent upon third-party financing, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if additional third-party financing for our customers does not become available

  Our business and earnings depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing for the development of their construction projects, which may be adversely impacted by rising interest rates. The availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry, the departure of financial institutions from the industry, the financial institutions’ lending practices, the strength of the domestic and international credit markets generally, governmental policies and other conditions, all of which are beyond our control. In light of the current economic climate, some of our projects may not be successful in obtaining additional funds in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all. The availability of borrowed funds, especially for construction financing, has been greatly reduced, and lenders may require project developers to invest increased amounts of equity in a project in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans. Unfavorable changes in the availability and terms of financing in the industry will have a material adverse effect on certain privately financed projects.
  Our results of operations also depend on the ability of any potential privately financed licensees to obtain loans for the purchase of new buildings. Over the past few years, lenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards, which have reduced lending volumes. If this trend continues, it would negatively impact our sales, which depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing. In addition, where our potential customers must sell their existing buildings or real estate in order to develop new buildings, increases in mortgage costs and/or lack of availability of mortgages could prevent buyers of potential customers’ existing buildings from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete their purchases, which would result in our potential customers’ inability to make purchases from us. If our potential customers cannot obtain suitable financing, our sales and results of operations would be adversely affected.
The construction industry is highly competitive, and such competition may increase the adverse effects of industry conditions, including the consolidation of the industry.

We operate in a very competitive environment characterized by competition from numerous local, regional and national builders. We may compete for financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. A decline in construction starts could adversely affect demand for our buildings and our results of operations. Increased competition could require us to further increase our selling incentives and/or reduce our prices, which could negatively affect our profits. We may be unable to successfully expand into or compete in the markets in new geographic areas. In addition, while we believe our ESR may improve our competitive position by potentially expediting reviews and approvals by state and local building departments and certifying our specific quality control and design acceptance criteria, there is no assurance that it will have the desired impact.

There can be no assurance that Modules or modular construction techniques that utilize our technology and expertise will achieve market acceptance and grow; thus, the future of our business and the modular construction industry as a whole is uncertain.

There can be no assurance that we will achieve market acceptance for our technology and expertise or that the modular construction market will grow. Our business may be disrupted by the introduction of new products and services and is subject to changing consumer preferences and industry trends, which may adversely affect our ability to plan for the future development and marketing of our products. Although Modules have particular applications in a wide variety of market segments, there is no assurance that we will be able to expand our relationship within such market segments or, even if we do, that general market acceptance for our technology and expertise or Modules will continue to increase.
Government regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our projects, increase our expenses or limit our building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.

Various domestic and international rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the construction industry. Governmental regulation affects construction activities, as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers.  These industries also have experienced an increase in state and local legislation in the United States and regulations that limit the availability or use of land. Municipalities may also restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. In addition, we may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. If governments in locations in which we operate take actions like the ones described, they could adversely affect our business by causing delays, increasing our costs or limiting our ability to operate in those areas. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed projects, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties. Failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to or affecting us, or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws affecting us, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 The dangers inherent in our operations, such as disruptions to our facilities and project sites, and the limits on insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability costs and materially interfere with the performance of our operations.

While we believe our insurance coverage is adequate and in line with our industry’s standards, all construction, including modular construction, involves operating hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and suspension of operations, including, but not limited to, natural or man-made disruptions to our facilities and project sites. The failure of such structures during and after installation can result in similar injuries and damages. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability. In addition, changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we and our competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.
Risks Relating to SG DevCorp. 

The long-term sustainability of SG DevCorp.’s operations as well as future growth depends in part upon SG DevCorp.’s ability to acquire land parcels suitable for residential projects at reasonable prices.

The long-term sustainability of SG DevCorp.’s operations, as well as future growth, depends in large part on the price at which it is able to obtain suitable land parcels for development or homebuilding operations. SG DevCorp.’s ability to acquire land parcels for various residential projects may be adversely affected by changes in the general availability of land parcels, the willingness of land sellers to sell land parcels at reasonable prices, competition for available land parcels, availability of financing to acquire land parcels, zoning, regulations that limit housing density, the ability to obtain building permits, environmental requirements and other market conditions and regulatory requirements. If suitable lots or land at reasonable prices become less available, the number of units SG DevCorp. may be able to build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased substantially, which could adversely impact it. As competition for suitable land increases, the cost of undeveloped lots and the cost of developing owned land could also rise and the availability of suitable land at acceptable prices may decline, which could adversely impact it. The availability of suitable land assets could also affect the success of SG DevCorp.’s land acquisition strategy, which may impact SG DevCorp.’s ability to maintain or increase the number of active communities, as well as to sustain and grow its revenues and margins, and achieve or maintain profitability. Additionally, developing undeveloped land is capital intensive and time consuming and SG DevCorp. may develop land based upon forecasts and assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, resulting in projects that are not economically viable.  

SG DevCorp. operates in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and SG DevCorp. may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of real property assets.

The housing industry is highly competitive, and SG DevCorp. faces competition from many sources, including from other housing communities both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where SG DevCorp.’s properties are and will be located. Furthermore, housing communities SG DevCorp. invests in compete, or will compete, with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents, including owner occupied single and multifamily homes available to rent or purchase. Increased competition may prevent SG DevCorp. from acquiring attractive land parcels or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder SG DevCorp.’s market share expansion, or lead to pricing pressures that may adversely impact its margins and revenues. Competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to SG DevCorp.’s products and because they are or may be significantly larger, have a longer operating history, and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than it, may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which SG DevCorp. operates or plans to operate.
SG DevCorp. will also compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and public and private REITs to make certain of the investments that it plans to make. Many of such competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than it. In addition, some of SG DevCorp.’s competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, allowing them to pay higher consideration, consider a wider variety of investments and establish more effective relationships than it.
These competitive conditions could adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s ability to make investments. Moreover, SG DevCorp.’s ability to close transactions will be subject to its ability to access financing within stipulated contractual time frames, and there is no assurance that it will have access to such financing on terms that are favorable to it, if at all.

SG DevCorp.’s property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in certain states. 

To date, SG DevCorp.’s properties are located in Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma. Certain of SG DevCorp.’s properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including hurricanes or other severe weather, flooding fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms or earthquakes. These adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to SG DevCorp.’s properties which could exceed its insurance coverage. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, SG DevCorp. could lose its capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. SG DevCorp. could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s business and its financial condition and results of operations.
To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur, SG DevCorp. may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature and rising sea levels, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of SG DevCorp.’s properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, SG DevCorp.’s financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of SG DevCorp.’s existing properties or to protect them from the consequence of climate change.
There can be no assurance that the properties in SG DevCorp.’s development pipeline will be completed in accordance with the anticipated timing or cost.
The development of the projects in SG DevCorp.’s pipeline is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of SG DevCorp.’s control, including:

● | inability to obtain entitlements;

● | inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms; 
● | default by any of the contractors it engages to construct SG DevCorp.’s projects; 
● | site accidents; and 
● | failure to secure tenants or residents in the anticipated time frame, on acceptable terms, or at all.


SG DevCorp. can provide no assurances that it will complete any of the projects in SG DevCorp.’s development pipeline on the anticipated schedule or within the budget, or that, once completed, these properties will achieve the results that it expects. If the development of these projects is not completed in accordance with SG DevCorp.’s anticipated timing or cost, or the properties fail to achieve the financial results it expects, it could have a material adverse effect on SG DevCorp.’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and ability to repay SG DevCorp.’s debt, including project-related debt.

SG DevCorp.’s insurance coverage on its properties may be inadequate to cover any losses it may incur and its insurance costs may increase.

SG DevCorp. maintains insurance on its properties. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economical to insure. Further, insurance companies often increase premiums, require higher deductibles, reduce limits, restrict coverage, and refuse to insure certain types of risks, which may result in increased costs or adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s business. SG DevCorp. uses its discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles, for insurance, based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of SG DevCorp.’s lost investment. In addition, SG DevCorp. may become liable for injuries and accidents at SG DevCorp.’s properties that are underinsured. A significant uninsured loss or increase in insurance costs could materially and adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 

SG DevCorp. may not be able to secure sufficient modular units to complete its developments using modules built by SG Echo

SG DevCorp. intend to construct many of its planned developments using modules built by SG Holdings subsidiary, SG Echo, and to rely on SG Holdings and SG Echo as the sole source of the modular units used in its projects. SG Holdings has a $6,810,762 backlog of signed construction and engineering contracts in existence at December 31, 2022 on which work has not yet begun. SG DevCorp.’s ability to complete its modular developments will be limited to the available capacity of the SG Echo facility. If SG DevCorp. is unable to secure sufficient modular units to complete its developments using modules built by SG Echo, its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.

SG DevCorp.’s operating results may be negatively affected by potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks.

SG DevCorp. has acquired properties upon which it will construct improvements. In connection with SG DevCorp.’s development activities, it is subject to uncertainties associated with re-zoning for development, environmental concerns of governmental entities or community groups and SG DevCorp.’s contractor’s or partner’s ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs, and timetables. Performance also may be affected or delayed by conditions beyond its control. SG DevCorp. may incur additional risks when it makes periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction. If a builder or development partner fails to perform, SG DevCorp. may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance, but there can be no assurance any legal action would be successful. These and other factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of SG DevCorp.’s investment. In addition, SG DevCorp. will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects. SG DevCorp. also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a price at the time it acquires the property. If SG DevCorp.’s projections are inaccurate, SG DevCorp. may pay too much for a property, and its return on its investment could suffer.

SG DevCorp. relies on third-party suppliers and long supply chains, and if it fails to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if there is a significant interruption in its supply chains, SG DevCorp.’s ability to timely and efficiently access raw materials that meet its standards for quality could be adversely affected.
SG DevCorp.’s ability to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy its standards for quality and its need to access products and supplies in a timely and efficient manner will be a significant challenge. SG DevCorp. may be required to replace a supplier if their products do not meet its quality or safety standards. In addition, SG DevCorp.’s suppliers could discontinue selling products at any time for reasons that may or may not be in its control or the suppliers’ control. SG DevCorp.’s operating results and inventory levels could suffer if it is unable to promptly replace a supplier who is unwilling or unable to satisfy its requirements with a supplier providing similar products. SG DevCorp.’s suppliers’ ability to deliver products may also be affected by financing constraints caused by credit market conditions, which could negatively impact its revenue and costs, at least until alternate sources of supply are arranged.


The construction of manufacturing facilities involves significant risks.

SG DevCorp. has limited experience constructing manufacturing facilities and doing so is a complex and lengthy undertaking that requires sophisticated, multi-disciplinary planning and precise execution. The construction of manufacturing facilities is subject to a number of risks. In particular, the construction costs may materially exceed budgeted amounts, which could adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s results of operations and financial condition. For example, SG DevCorp. may suffer construction delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors, such as labor and material shortages, defects in materials and workmanship, adverse weather conditions, transportation constraints, construction change orders, site changes, labor issues and other unforeseen difficulties, any of which could delay or prevent the completion of SG DevCorp.’s planned facilities. While SG DevCorp.’s goal is to negotiate contracts with engineering, procurement and construction firms that minimize risk, any delays or cost overruns it encounters may result in the renegotiation of SG DevCorp.’s construction contracts, which could increase its costs.

In addition, the construction of manufacturing facilities may be subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Such agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on a production facility that could potentially prevent construction from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. If construction costs are higher than it anticipates, SG DevCorp. may be unable to achieve its expected investment return, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations.

Discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s operating results.

SG DevCorp. is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that (a) regulate certain activities and operations that may have environmental or health and safety effects, such as the management, generation, release or disposal of regulated materials, substances or wastes, (b) impose liability for the costs of cleaning up, and damages to natural resources from, past spills, waste disposals on and off-site, or other releases of hazardous materials or regulated substances, and (c) regulate workplace safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations could increase SG DevCorp.’s operational costs. Violation of these laws may subject SG DevCorp. to significant fines, penalties or disposal costs, which could negatively impact its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of currently or formerly owned, leased or operated real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. The costs of removal or remediation could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Accordingly, SG DevCorp. may incur significant costs to defend against claims of liability, to comply with environmental regulatory requirements, to remediate any contaminated property, or to pay personal injury claims. 
Moreover, environmental laws also may impose liens on property or other restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent SG DevCorp. or its lessees from operating such properties. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require SG DevCorp. to incur material expenditures. Future laws, ordinances or regulations or the discovery of currently unknown conditions or non-compliances may impose material liability under environmental laws.

Legislative, regulatory, accounting or tax rules, and any changes to them or actions brought to enforce them, could adversely affect SG DevCorp. 

SG DevCorp. is subject to a wide range of legislative, regulatory, accounting and tax rules. The costs and efforts of compliance with these laws, or of defending against actions brought to enforce them, could adversely affect SG DevCorp. In addition, if there are changes to the laws, regulations or administrative decisions and actions that affect SG DevCorp., SG DevCorp. may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply, or SG DevCorp. may have to restrict or change its operations.


 SG DevCorp. has invested, and expect to continue to invest, in real property assets which are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, noise levels, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liabilities on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate and remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal. This liability could be substantial. In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, could adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s ability to sell, rent or pledge an affected property as collateral for future borrowings. SG DevCorp. intends to take commercially reasonable steps when it can to protect itself from the risks of environmental law liability; however, SG DevCorp. may not obtain independent third-party environmental assessments for every property it acquires. In addition, any such assessments that it does obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities, or whether a prior owner of a property created a material environmental condition not known to it. In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, safety and similar regulations with which SG DevCorp. may be required to comply, and that may subject it to liability in the form of fines or damages. In all events, the existing condition of land when SG DevCorp. buys it, operations in the vicinity of its properties or activities of unrelated third parties could all affect its properties in ways that lead to costs being imposed on it.
Any material expenditures, fines, damages or forced changes to SG DevCorp.’s business or strategy resulting from any of the above could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

SG DevCorp.’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry. 

The U.S. real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by global, national and local economic conditions, general employment and income levels, availability of financing, interest rates, and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors impacting real estate businesses include over-building, changes in traffic patterns, changes in demographic conditions, changes in tenant and buyer preferences and changes in government requirements, including tax law changes. These factors are outside of SG DevCorp.’s control and may have a material adverse effect on its business, profits and the timing and amounts of its cash flows. 

SG DevCorp.’s industry is cyclical and adverse changes in general and local economic conditions could reduce the demand for housing and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on us. 

SG DevCorp.’s business can be substantially affected by adverse changes in general economic or business conditions that are outside of its control, including changes in short-term and long-term interest rates; employment levels and job and personal income growth; housing demand from population growth, household formation and other demographic changes, among other factors; availability and pricing of mortgage financing for homebuyers; consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular; consumer spending; financial system and credit market stability; private party and government mortgage loan programs (including changes in FHA, USDA, VA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conforming mortgage loan limits, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees, down payment requirements and underwriting standards), and federal and state regulation, oversight and legal action regarding lending, appraisal, foreclosure and short sale practices; federal and state personal income tax rates and provisions, including provisions for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other expenses; supply of and prices for available new or resale multifamily units; interest of financial institutions or other businesses in purchases; and real estate taxes. Adverse changes in these conditions may affect SG DevCorp.’s business nationally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular submarkets in which it operates. Inclement weather, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, prolonged periods of precipitation, droughts, and fires), other calamities and other environmental conditions can delay the delivery of its units and/or increase its costs. Civil unrest or acts of terrorism can also have a negative effect on its business. If the housing industry experiences a significant or sustained downturn, it would materially adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s business and results of operations in future years. The potential difficulties described above can cause demand and prices for SG DevCorp.’s units to fall or cause it to take longer and incur more costs to develop the land and build its units. SG DevCorp. may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because of market conditions.

Fluctuations in real estate values may require SG DevCorp. to write-down the book value of its real estate assets.

The housing and land development industries are subject to significant variability and fluctuations in real estate values. As a result, SG DevCorp. may be required to write-down the book value of SG DevCorp.’s real estate assets in accordance with GAAP, and some of those write-downs could be material. Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on SG DevCorp.’s business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, valuations of real estate properties do not necessarily represent the price at which a willing buyer would purchase such property; therefore, there can be no assurance that SG DevCorp. would realize the values underlying estimated valuations of SG DevCorp.’s properties if it were to sell such properties. 


Inflation could adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s business and financial results. 

Inflation could adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s business and financial results by increasing the costs of land, raw materials and labor needed to operate SG DevCorp.’s business. If SG DevCorp.’s markets have an oversupply of housing, relative to demand, SG DevCorp. may be unable to offset any such increases in costs with corresponding higher sales prices for its units or buildings. Inflation may also accompany higher interest rates, which could adversely impact potential customers’ ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby further decreasing demand. If SG DevCorp. is unable to raise the prices of its units or buildings to offset the increasing costs of its operations, its margins could decrease. Furthermore, if SG DevCorp. needs to lower the price of its units to meet demand, the value of its land inventory may decrease. Inflation may also raise SG DevCorp.’s costs of capital and decrease its purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate its business.

SG DevCorp. could be impacted by its investments through joint ventures, which involve risks not present in investments in which SG DevCorp. is the sole owner. 

SG DevCorp. has and may continue to fund development projects through the use of joint ventures. Joint ventures involve risks including, but not limited to, the possibility that the other joint venture partners may possess the ability to take or force action contrary to its interests or withhold consent contrary to its requests, have business goals which are or become inconsistent with SG DevCorp.’s or default on their financial obligations to the joint venture, which may require it to fulfill the joint venture’s financial obligations as a legal or practical matter. SG DevCorp. and its joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause it to sell its interest, or acquire a joint venture partner’s interest, at a time when it otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. In addition, a sale or transfer by it to a third party of its interests in the joint venture may be subject to consent rights or rights of first refusal in favor of its partners which would restrict SG DevCorp.’s ability to dispose of its interest in the joint venture. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and its ability to operate, finance, or dispose of a joint venture project in its sole discretion is limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement.

Risks associated with SG DevCorp.’s land and lot inventories could adversely affect its business or financial results.

Risks inherent in controlling, purchasing, holding, and developing land are substantial. The risks inherent in purchasing and developing land parcels increase as consumer demand for housing decreases and the holding period increases. As a result, SG DevCorp. may buy and develop land parcels on which housing units cannot be profitably built and sold. In certain circumstances, a grant of entitlements or development agreement with respect to a particular parcel of land may include restrictions on the transfer of such entitlements to a buyer of such land, which could negatively impact the price of such entitled land by restricting its ability to sell it for its full entitled value. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in reduced margins or losses in a poorly performing community or market. The time and investment required for development may adversely impact its business. In the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions, SG DevCorp. may have to sell units or buildings at significantly lower margins or at a loss, if SG DevCorp. is able to sell them at all. Additionally, deteriorating market conditions could cause SG DevCorp. to record significant inventory impairment charges. The recording of a significant inventory impairment could negatively affect its reported earnings per share and negatively impact the market perception of its business.

SG DevCorp. may not be able to sell its real property assets when it desires.

Investments in real property are relatively illiquid compared to other investments. Accordingly, SG DevCorp. may not be able to sell real property assets when it desires or at prices acceptable to it. This could substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying its obligations, including any debt obligations. 


Access to financing sources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect SG DevCorp.’s ability to maximize its returns.

SG DevCorp.’s access to third-party sources of financing will depend, in part, on: 

● | general market conditions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the market’s perception of its growth potential; 
● | with respect to acquisition and/or development financing, the market’s perception of the value of the land parcels to be acquired and/or developed;
● | its current debt levels; 
● | its current and expected future earnings; 
● | its cash flow; and 
● | if applicable, the market price per share of its common stock. 

The global credit and equity markets and the overall economy can be extremely volatile, which could have a number of adverse effects on SG DevCorp.’s operations and capital requirements. For the past decade, the domestic financial markets have experienced a high degree of volatility, uncertainty and, during certain periods, tightening of liquidity in both the high yield debt and equity capital markets, resulting in certain periods where new capital has been both more difficult and more expensive to access. If SG DevCorp. is unable to access the credit markets, it could be required to defer or eliminate important business strategies and growth opportunities in the future. In addition, if there is volatility and weakness in the capital and credit markets, potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide SG DevCorp. with financing that is attractive to it or may increase collateral requirements or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing. Consequently, SG DevCorp.’s ability to access the credit market in order to attract financing on reasonable terms may be adversely affected. Investment returns on SG DevCorp.’s assets and its ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by its inability to secure additional financing on reasonable terms, if at all. Depending on market conditions at the relevant time, SG DevCorp. may have to rely more heavily on additional equity financings or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of its cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for SG DevCorp.’s operations, future business opportunities and other purposes. SG DevCorp. may not have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all.

We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation and Distribution, and the Separation and Distribution may materially adversely affect our business.

We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation and Distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation and Distribution is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (1) enabling SG DevCorp.’s management to more effectively pursue its own distinct operating priorities and strategies; (2) permitting SG DevCorp. to allocate its financial resources to meet the unique needs of its business, which will allow SG DevCorp. to intensify our focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to more effectively pursue its own distinct capital structure and capital allocation strategies; (3) allowing SG DevCorp. to more effectively articulate a clear investment thesis to attract a long-term investor base suited to its respective business and providing investors with a distinct and targeted investment opportunity; (4) creating an independent equity security tracking SG DevCorp.’s underlying business, which should afford direct access to the capital markets and facilitate SG DevCorp.’s ability to consummate future acquisitions or other transactions using its common stock; and (5) permitting SG DevCorp. to more effectively recruit, retain and motivate employees through the use of stock-based compensation that more closely aligns management and employee incentives with specific business goals and objectives related to its business.

We may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (1) the Separation and Distribution will demand management’s time and effort, which may divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business; (2) following the Separation and Distribution, SG DevCorp. may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of the Company because its business will be less diversified than the Company’s business prior to the completion of the Separation; (3) the Separation may require us to pay costs that could be substantial and material to our financial resources, including accounting, tax, legal and other professional services costs, recruiting costs, and tax costs; and (4) after the Separation and Distribution, we cannot predict the trading prices of SG DevCorp.’s common stock or know whether the combined trading prices of the Company’s common stock and SG DevCorp.’s common stock will be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of the Company’s common stock prior to the Separation and Distribution. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The Company’s plan to separate into two publicly traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.

In December 2022, the Company announced its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies. The Separation and Distribution is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions (or waiver by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion), including final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors of the final terms of the Separation and Distribution. Furthermore, unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in the law, the macroeconomic environment, competitive conditions of the Company’s markets could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed Separation and Distribution, or cause the Separation and Distribution to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected. 
The process of completing the proposed Separation and Distribution has been and is expected to continue to be time-consuming and involves significant costs and expenses. The costs may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a discernible benefit if the Separation and Distribution is not completed or is not well executed, or the expected benefits of the Separation and Distribution are not realized.

Risks Relating to the Medical Sector

We are dependent on the availability and skill of subcontractors, their willingness to work with us as the clinical operators of our medical modules, and their expertise in the medical industry. 
We have relied and expect to continue to rely on subcontractors to perform medical services as the clinical operators and staffers of our medical modules. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable costs and on a timely basis could erode our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Relating to our Common Stock
Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq” or the “Nasdaq Capital Market”), which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum bid requirement.Although we are currently in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market in the past we have experiences periods of time when we were not compliant with the minimum bid price requirements and, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance in the future. 

The delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms in the future, or at all. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. Further, if our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq, our common stock would cease to be recognized as a covered security, and we would be subject to additional regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Moreover, there is no assurance that any actions that we take to restore our compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid requirement would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from falling below the Nasdaq minimum bid price required for continued listing again or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements. 
There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or any other requirement in the future. If we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement, or other applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, including maintaining minimum levels of stockholders’ equity or market values of our common stock, our common stock could be delisted. Delisting from Nasdaq would cause us to pursue eligibility for trading of our common stock on other markets or exchanges, or on an over-the-counter market. In such case, our stockholders’ ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices of these securities. There can be no assurance that our common stock, if delisted from the Nasdaq, would be listed on a national securities exchange, a national quotation service or the over-the-counter markets. Delisting from the Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity, make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital, adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, decrease securities analysts’ coverage of us or diminish investor, supplier and employee confidence. In addition, our stock could become a “penny stock,” which would make trading of our common stock more difficult.

Our stock price has been subject to fluctuations in the past, has recently been volatile, and will likely continue to be subject to fluctuations and decline, due to factors beyond our control, and investors in our common stock may lose all or part of their investment in our company.
  The trading price of our common stock has been and is expected to continue to be volatile and has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. On March 15, 2023, the reported low sale price of our common stock was $0.86, the reported high sale price was $0.95 and closing price of our common stock was $0.87 while on June 30, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $1.66. We may incur rapid and substantial decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that are unrelated to our operating performance for prospects. In addition to the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, these factors include:


● | economic and market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the construction industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | additions or departures of key personnel;
--+------------------------------------------


● | operating results that fall below expectations;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | industry developments;
--+-----------------------


● | new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | material litigation or government disputes;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the size of our market float and potential dilution due to the exercise of outstanding options and warrants;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders, including sales pursuant to a registration statement filed to permit a significant stockholder to sell shares of our common stock, pursuant to certain registration rights granted to such stockholder;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other events or factors, including those resulting from such events, or the prospect of such events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus, and natural disasters such as fire, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or elsewhere, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of our suppliers or result in political or economic instability; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


In addition, the securities markets have, from time to time, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Since the stock price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past, has recently been volatile and will likely be volatile in the future, investors in our common stock may lose all or part of their investment in our company.  In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.

The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.

  We are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to continue to maintain our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.
 
  In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed. As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition are more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline.

The price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.
In addition, shares subject to outstanding options under our Incentive Plan are and will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. Substantial sales of such shares, at that time, could depress the sale price of our common stock.

Significant sales of our common stock, or the possibility that these sales may occur, might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions in the future. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of common stock.
The issuance of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options, warrants and restricted stock units may dilute the percentage ownership of the then-existing stockholders and may make it more difficult to raise additional equity capital.

As of March 29, 2023, there are outstanding options and warrants to purchase 36,436 and 2,025,520 shares of common stock, respectively, in addition to 3,212,504 vested and unvested restricted stock units. The exercise of such options and warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units would dilute the then-existing stockholders’ percentage ownership of our stock, and any sales in the public market of common stock underlying such securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock. Moreover, the terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could be adversely affected because the holders of our options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided by such securities. 


The issuance of additional securities by our Board of Directors (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) will dilute the ownership interests of our current stockholders and could discourage the acquisition of us.

Our Board, without any action by our stockholders, is authorized to designate and issue additional classes or series of capital stock (including classes or series of preferred stock) as it deems appropriate and to establish the rights, preferences and privileges of such classes or series, and we currently have an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, providing for the potential issuance of shares of our common stock and other securities. The issuance of any new class or series of capital stock would not only dilute the ownership interest of our current stockholders but may also adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock. The rights of holders of preferred stock and other classes of common stock that may be issued may be superior to the rights of the holders of the existing class of common stock in terms of the payment of ordinary and liquidating dividends and voting rights.

In addition, the ability of the Board to designate and issue such shares could impede or deter an unsolicited tender offer or takeover proposal regarding us and the issuance of additional shares having preferential rights could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of holders of common stock and render more difficult the removal of current management, even if such removal may be in the stockholders’ best interests.

We do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.

For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deem relevant. Accordingly, if you purchase shares of our common stock, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or our industry, or publish negative reports about our business or our industry, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our industry or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, change their opinion of the prospects for our company in a negative manner or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
Certain provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.
Certain provisions of Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Such provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of the Company, including a transaction in which the acquirer may offer a premium price for our stock.
If our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.
The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and if the price of our shares of common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock (meaning that our shares may be considered highly speculative and may trade infrequently, which can make them difficult to accurately price or sell). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive: (i) the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. 
As a “smaller reporting company,” we may avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors.
  We are a “smaller reporting company” under applicable SEC rules and regulations, and, as a result of the SEC’s recent amendment to the definition of “smaller reporting company,” we will continue to be a “smaller reporting company” for so long as either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of the end of our most recently completed second quarter (“public float”) is less than $250 million or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and (A) no public float or (B) a public float of less than $700 million. As a “smaller reporting company,” we have relied on exemptions from certain SEC disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These exemptions include reduced financial disclosure and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Until such time as we cease to be a “smaller reporting company,” such reduced disclosure in our SEC filings may make it harder for investors to analyze our operating results and financial prospects. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reduced disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
Our shares of common stock are from time to time thinly traded, so stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares.
  Our common stock has from time to time been “thinly-traded,” meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give stockholders any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.
