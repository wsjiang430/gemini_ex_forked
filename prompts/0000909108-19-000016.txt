The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “project,” “estimate,” “should,” “hope,” “seek,” “plan,” “intend,” variations of such words and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. While we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and, accordingly, our actual results and experiences could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such actual results or experiences to differ from results discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the adverse effect from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance of our products; changes in interest rates; changes in national and local economic and political conditions; the continuing economic uncertainty in various parts of the world; changes in government policy and regulation, including monetary policy; changes in our ability to attract or retain key employees; unforeseen costs and other effects related to legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory organizations; and other risks identified from time-to-time in other public documents on file with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including those discussed below in Item 1A. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when we use the terms the “Company,” “management,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Diamond Hill and its subsidiaries.
Overview
Diamond Hill, an Ohio corporation organized in April 1990, derives its consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory and fund administration services provided by its wholly owned subsidiary, Diamond Hill Capital Management, Inc. (“DHCM”). DHCM is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. DHCM sponsors, distributes, and provides investment advisory and related services to clients through Diamond Hill Funds (the “Funds”), institutional accounts, an exchange traded fund, and private investment funds. In July of 2016, the Company sold two former wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Beacon Hill Fund Services, Inc. (“BHFS”) and BHIL Distributors, Inc. (“BHIL” and collectively “Beacon Hill”). Until its sale, Beacon Hill provided fund administration and statutory underwriting services. 
The Company’s primary objective is to fulfill our fiduciary duty to our clients. Our secondary objective is to grow the intrinsic value of the Company in order to achieve an adequate long-term return for our shareholders.
Investment Advisory Activities
Clients
The Company provides investment advisory services to a broad range of clients, including corporations, mutual funds, retirement plans, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, financial institutions and high net worth individuals. We strive to expand our client base by attracting new clients and earning additional business from existing clients.
Investment Philosophy
We believe intrinsic value is independent of market price and that competitive long-term returns can be achieved by identifying meaningful differences between the two. We believe we can identify those market opportunities with a bottom-up, intrinsic value-focused approach to active investment management. As a result, our investment strategy is driven by individual security decisions rather than by a macro-economic focus. 
Investment Process
DHCM’s equity investment process begins with fundamental research focusing on estimating a company’s intrinsic value independent of its current stock price. Bottom-up analysis, described in further detail below, is of primary importance in estimating the intrinsic value of an individual company. Our research analysts also evaluate each company within the context of sector and industry secular trends. A five-year discounted cash flow analysis is the primary methodology we use to determine whether there is a discrepancy between the current market price and DHCM’s estimate of intrinsic value. The key factors in determining the intrinsic value through are normalized earnings and earnings growth rate, payout ratio and dividends, terminal earnings multiple, and required rate of return. We will invest when we believe that we can make informed judgments about, and 
3

estimates of, those cash flows and when our estimate of intrinsic value provides a margin of safety relative to the current market price. We assign the highest portfolio weights where we have the highest conviction. Within stated diversification constraints, we are willing to take outsized positions in our highest conviction ideas. Benchmark weights are not a consideration.
DHCM also applies an intrinsic value philosophy and process to the analysis of fixed income securities. For our Short Duration Total Return and Core Bond strategies, our investment process is driven by security selection, sector allocation, yield curve positioning, and duration management in concert with overall portfolio management. We seek to generate excess return through the selection of undervalued securities and spread sectors that offer incremental yield and total return in comparison to the index. The hallmark of our process is the selection of individual issues with an emphasis on identifying undervalued securities. Individual securities are selected following a risk/reward evaluation of interest rate and credit risk, and an examination of the complex and technical structure of the security. We only purchase those securities that we identify as undervalued and offer a strong total return profile relative to similar securities. 
For our Corporate Credit and High Yield strategies, we leverage the industry analysis conducted by our research team to identify attractive corporate bonds. We seek to invest in bonds of companies with improving return on invested capital and stable or improving competitive positions. We work closely with our research team to understand the fundamental economic drivers of the business and to assess whether there is adequate financial strength and flexibility to meet ongoing commitments. Our research analysts consider debt instruments as part of their analysis. After the credit research is complete, our portfolio managers determine whether a security is attractive on a yield basis relative to asset and interest coverage and relative to other securities with comparable risk. We will only own the bonds of a company that we can analyze and value.
DHCM believes that many investors’ short-term focus hinders their long-term results, which creates market inefficiencies and therefore opportunities. In addition, the size and complexity of the fixed income markets also creates inefficiencies. We believe that we can exploit these market anomalies/inefficiencies by possessing a long-term investment temperament and practicing a consistent and repeatable intrinsic value-focused approach to investing.
Investment Advisory Fees
The Company’s principal source of revenue is investment advisory fee income earned from managing client accounts under investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements. The fees earned depend on the type of investment strategy, account size and servicing requirements. Revenues depend on the total value and composition of assets under management (“AUM”). Accordingly, net cash flows from clients, market fluctuations in client portfolios, and the composition of AUM impact our revenues and results of operations. We also have certain agreements which allow us to earn variable rate fees in the event that investment returns exceed targeted amounts during a measurement period.
Investment Strategies
The Company offers several traditional and alternative investment strategies, which are all based on the same intrinsic value philosophy. As of December 31, 2018, we offered the following representative investment strategies to our clients:

1. | Small Cap - Pursues long-term capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of primarily small capitalization U.S. equity securities.

Investment Results
The Company believes that one of the most important characteristics exhibited by the best investment firms is excellent investment returns for their clients over a long period of time. We are pleased that during our history as an investment advisory firm, we have delivered what we believe are strong long-term investment returns for our clients. Investment returns have been a key driver in the long-term success we have achieved in growing AUM.
As of December 31, 2018, the since-inception returns for most of our strategies exceeded their respective benchmark returns. Our Mid Cap strategy reached its five-year track record at the end of 2018 and we launched the Diamond Hill Global Fund in January 2018. As always, we remain focused on five-year periods to evaluate our results.

Capacity
The Company’s primary goal is to fulfill our fiduciary duty to clients. We understand that our ability to retain and grow assets as a firm has been, and will be, driven primarily by delivering attractive long-term investment results to our clients. When we have determined that the size of any of our strategies hinders our ability to add value over a passive alternative, we have closed those strategies to new clients and we will continue to do so, which will impact our ability to grow AUM. We have prioritized, and will continue to prioritize, investment results over asset accumulation. Currently, the Long-Short, Small Cap, and Small-Mid Cap strategies are closed to new investors. 
We estimate capacity of $25 - 35 billion for our existing equity strategies ($17.6 billion as of December 31, 2018) and capacity of at least $40 billion for our existing fixed income strategies ($1.5 billion as of December 31, 2018).  Determining our AUM capacity requires evaluating each of our investment strategies and estimating individual strategy capacity, given market capitalization and concentration constraints as well as investment objectives.  Total firm capacity is not simply a sum of the individual strategies and is affected by overlap between strategies.  With the development of new products or strategies, our firm level capacity could increase.
Distribution Channels
The Company’s investment advisory services are distributed through multiple channels. Our institutional sales efforts include building relationships with institutional consultants and also establishing direct relationships with institutional clients. Our sales efforts for the Funds include wholesaling to third-party financial intermediaries, including independent registered investment 
7

advisers, brokers, financial planners, and wealth advisers, who utilize the Funds in investment programs they construct for their clients.
AUM by Channel
Below is a summary of our AUM by distribution channel for the five years ended December 31, 2018:

Growth Strategy
The Company’s growth strategy will remain focused on achieving excellent investment results in all our strategies and providing the highest level of client service. We will continue to focus on the development of distribution channels to enable us to offer our various investment strategies to a broad array of clients. We seek to continue to grow our AUM through our proprietary funds, institutional accounts, and sub-advised funds. We have a targeted strategic business plan to further penetrate our existing distribution channels. Our business development efforts are focused on expanding the institutional consultant channel and plan sponsor network on the institutional side, as well as our intermediary network on the fund side.
Fund Administration Activities
The Company provides fund administration services to the Funds. Fund administration services are broadly defined in our administration agreements with the Funds as portfolio and regulatory compliance, treasury and financial oversight, oversight of back-office service providers such as the custodian, fund accountant, and transfer agent, and general business management and governance of the mutual fund complex. Prior to the sale of Beacon Hill, the Company also provided fund administration services to other third party mutual fund companies and investment advisers. 
Competition
Competition in the area of investment management is intense, and our competitors include investment management firms, broker-dealers, banks and insurance companies, some of whom offer various investment alternatives, including passive index strategies. Many competitors are better known than the Company, offer a broader range of investment products and have more offices, employees and business development representatives. We compete primarily on the basis of philosophy, performance and client service.

Regulation
The Company and our business are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of participants in those markets, including investment advisory clients and shareholders of investment funds. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event the adviser fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser, broker/dealer, and other registrations, censures and fines.
DHCM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) and operates in a highly regulated environment. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. All of the Funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are required to make notice filings with all states where the Funds are offered for sale. Virtually all aspects of our investment advisory and fund administration business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. 
DHCM is a “fiduciary” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) with respect to benefit plan clients and, therefore, is subject to ERISA regulations. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients, and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The U.S. Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, has been increasingly active in proposing and adopting regulations affecting the asset management industry. 
The Company’s trading activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of trading requirements (e.g., volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States.
The preceding descriptions of the regulatory and statutory provisions applicable to us are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to their respective statutory or regulatory provisions. Failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Contractual Relationships with the Funds
The Company is highly dependent on our contractual relationships with the Funds. In the event any of our advisory or administration agreements with the Funds was terminated, not renewed, or amended to reduce fees, we would be materially and adversely affected. We generated approximately 79%, 80% and 74% of our 2018, 2017 and 2016 revenues, respectively, from our advisory and administrative contracts with the Funds. We consider our relationship with the Funds and their board of trustees to be good, and have no reason to believe that these advisory or administration contracts will not be renewed in the future; however, there is no assurance that the Funds will choose to continue their relationships with the Company. Please see Item 1A for risk factors regarding this relationship.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 125 full-time equivalent employees. As of December 31, 2017, the number of full-time equivalent employees was 118. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Our employee count has grown year-over-year and we expect that general trend to continue.
SEC Filings
The Company maintains an Internet website at www.diamond-hill.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports that we file or furnish pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge, on or through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These filings are also available on the Commission’s web-site at http://www.sec.gov free of charge.
