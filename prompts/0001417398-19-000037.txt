GENERAL

Hillenbrand (www.Hillenbrand.com) is a global diversified industrial company with multiple leading brands that serve a wide variety of industries around the world. Hillenbrand’s portfolio is composed of two business segments: the Process Equipment Group and Batesville®. The Process Equipment Group businesses design, develop, manufacture, and service highly engineered industrial equipment around the world. Batesville is a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America. Hillenbrand 
was incorporated on November 1, 2007, in the state of Indiana and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HI” on April 1, 2008.  “Hillenbrand,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar words refer to Hillenbrand, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless context otherwise requires. 
Although Hillenbrand has been a publicly traded company since 2008, the businesses owned by Hillenbrand have been in operation for many decades.
Between 2010 and 2014, Hillenbrand completed three major acquisitions of companies that formed the foundation of our Process Equipment Group:  K-Tron International, Inc. (“K-Tron”) in April 2010, Rotex Global, LLC (“Rotex”) in August 2011, and Coperion Capital GmbH (“Coperion”) in December 2012.  
TerraSource Global, also part of our Process Equipment Group, was organized in July 2012 from three brands, Gundlach Equipment Corporation, Jeffrey Rader Corporation, and Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation, each acquired as part of the K-Tron acquisition. The remaining K-Tron brands merged with Coperion during 2013.
In October 2015, Hillenbrand acquired Abel Pumps LP, Abel GmbH & Co. KG, and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Abel”). Additionally, in February 2016, Hillenbrand acquired Red Valve Company, Inc. (“Red Valve”). Both Abel and Red Valve are now included in our Process Equipment Group segment.
We completed the acquisition of Burnaby Machine and Mill Equipment Ltd. (“BM&M”) in November 2018. BM&M is also included in our Process Equipment Group segment. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the BM&M acquisition. 
As discussed in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K, on July 12, 2019, Hillenbrand entered into a definitive agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to acquire Milacron in a cash and stock merger transaction valued at approximately $2 billion, including debt, net of cash on hand. The proposed transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of stockholders of Milacron, which is scheduled to be sought at a special meeting on November 20, 2019. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon closing Milacron stockholders will receive $11.80 in cash and a fixed exchange ratio of 0.1612 shares of Hillenbrand common stock for each share of Milacron common stock they own.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Process Equipment Group

The Process Equipment Group designs, engineers, manufactures, markets, and services differentiated process and material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals and mining, energy, wastewater treatment, forest products, and other general industrials.  The Process Equipment Group uses its strong applications and process engineering expertise to solve problems for customers.  Its highly engineered capital equipment and systems offerings require after-market service and/or parts replacement, providing an opportunity for ongoing revenue at attractive margins.
Process Equipment Group:  Products and Services

The Process Equipment Group product portfolio has grown through a series of acquisitions over the past nine years and now includes products and services for compounding, extrusion, and material handling; screening and separating; flow control; and size reduction.  The Process Equipment Group businesses are supported by replacement parts and services that represent approximately 32% of the group’s total revenue.  Products are offered under brand names that are recognized among the leaders in their respective categories. 

• | Compounding, Extrusion, and Material Handling Equipment, and Equipment System Design


• | Twin screw compounding and extrusion machines range from small laboratory compounding machines to high performance, high throughput extrusion systems. Small and mid-sized compounders are used by customers in engineering plastics, masterbatch, PVC, recycling, biodegradable products, and other applications for the plastics, chemical, and food and pharmaceutical industries. Extrusion systems are sold to customers in the polyolefin industry for base resin production. All of these extrusion products are sold under the Coperion® brand. 


• | Material handling equipment includes pneumatic and hydraulic conveying equipment for difficult-to-move materials; high-precision feeders that can operate at both very high and very low fill rates; blenders for pellets and powders; and rotary valves, diverter valves, and slide-gate valves used for feeding, dosing, discharge, and distribution during pneumatic conveying. The proprietary equipment is highly engineered and designed to solve the needs of customers for customized solutions. Material handling equipment is sold to a variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and minerals and mining. These products are sold under the Coperion® and Coperion K-Tron® brands. 


• | Compounding, extrusion, and material handling equipment can be sold as a complete system, where strong application and process engineering expertise is used to design and create a broad system solution for customers. Systems can range from a single manufacturing line to large scale manufacturing lines and turnkey systems. Larger system sales are generally fulfilled over 18 to 24 months. Some portion of revenue for large system sales typically comes from third-party-sourced products that carry only a small up-charge. As a result, margin percentages tend to be lower on these large system sales when compared to the rest of the business. 


• | Screening and Separating Equipment


• | Screening and separating equipment sorts dry, granular products based on the size of the particles being processed. This equipment is sold under the Rotex® and BM&M® brands to customers in a variety of industries including 

proppants, fertilizers, chemicals, agricultural goods, plastics, forest products, and food processing. A majority of the equipment uses a unique technology based on a specific gyratory-reciprocating motion that provides an optimal material distribution on the screens, gentle handling of particles, and accurate separations.

• | Flow Control Solutions


• | Pump solutions mainly consist of piston and piston diaphragm pump technologies that transfer abrasive or corrosive fluids and fluids with a high sludge or solids content for mission-critical applications. This equipment is sold under the ABEL® Pump Technology brand into the power generation, wastewater treatment, mining, general industry, and marine markets. This equipment lends itself to a superior total cost of ownership over time compared to other pumping technologies. 


• | Valve solutions mainly consist of pinch valves and duckbill check valves that manage fluids for mission-critical, severe service applications. These valves, among others, are sold under the Red Valve®, Tideflex Technologies® , and RKL Controls brands into the water and wastewater, drainage and storm water, mining, chemicals, and power markets. These engineered valves are designed for long life in the toughest municipal and industrial applications, lending themselves to superior total costs of ownership over time. 


• | Size Reduction Equipment


• | Size reduction equipment is used to reduce the size of friable materials. Pennsylvania Crusher® and Gundlach® products are used to crush materials in the power generation, mining, quarrying, glass making, salt processing, and fertilizer manufacturing industries. Jeffrey Rader® products are used in industries including forest products, pulp and paper, biomass power and energy generation, and plastics/base resin manufacturing. Jeffrey Rader also designs and provides complete material handling and pneumatic or mechanical conveying systems to meet product specifications, including boiler feed, resource recovery, rail and truck loading/unloading, and recycling systems. 


• | Replacement Parts and Service


• | Replacement parts and service are a major component of most of the Process Equipment Group business lines. Service engineers and technicians are located around the globe to better respond to customers’ machines and systems service needs. The parts and service division offers customers service consulting, training, maintenance and repairs, spare parts, and modernization solutions. 

Process Equipment Group:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations

The Process Equipment Group sells equipment and systems throughout the world using a combination of direct sales and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors.  A part of the Process Equipment Group’s sales, especially in North America, is made through independent sales representatives who are compensated by commission.  

Equipment and systems orders are often for unique, engineered-to-order items. Products are either assembled and tested at Process Equipment Group facilities and then shipped to a customer or are assembled at the customer’s desired location.

We expect that future revenue associated with the Process Equipment Group will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered-to-order equipment for customers. Backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that we expect to realize on contracts awarded to the Process Equipment Group. Though backlog can be an indicator of future revenue, it does not include projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter.  The timing of order placement, size of order, extent of customization, and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue.  Revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than United States (“U.S.”) dollars.
Process Equipment Group:  Customers

The Process Equipment Group has customers in a wide range of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals and mining, energy, wastewater treatment, and forest products.  These customers range from large, Fortune 500 global companies to regional and local businesses.  No one Process Equipment Group customer accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated revenue during 2019.  For large or customized orders, customers generally pay a deposit and make progress payments in accordance with the project progress.  Often, long-term relationships are established with these customers.

The Process Equipment Group’s sales are diversified by end markets, and further penetration of these end markets is an important element of its strategy.  Currently, projects in the plastics industry represent greater than half of the Process Equipment Group’s sales.  Geographically, approximately 39% of Process Equipment Group revenue in 2019 came from the Americas, 34% from Asia, and 27% from EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa).
We believe that long-term growth for this segment is driven by megatrends such as a rapidly growing middle class in China and India and a growing global population, resulting in rising demand for products sold in many of the end markets the Process Equipment Group serves, including durable plastic goods.  These trends include increased use of lightweight plastics in the automotive industry to improve fuel efficiency; more effective packaging in emerging markets to improve food shelf life, freshness, and safety; a variety of applications in the medical space designed to improve safety, drug and therapy delivery, and durability; and more engineered plastics in construction that are more durable, lightweight and require little maintenance. While overall demand for these products is expected to increase over the long run, we expect short-term periodic fluctuations in demand from time-to-time.

Process Equipment Group:  Competition

We believe the Process Equipment Group holds leading positions in key industries because of design and quality of products, extensive application and process engineering expertise, product support services, brand name recognition, and commitment to serving the needs of customers.

The Process Equipment Group brands face strong competition in the markets where they compete. Competitors range in size from small, privately-held companies serving narrow market segments or geographical areas to larger, well-known global companies serving national and international markets with multiple product lines.  We believe the Process Equipment Group’s diversification into multiple industries and markets, its base of replacement parts business, and its strong worldwide network of suppliers and dealers will allow it to maintain leadership positions even during economic downturns.

Process Equipment Group:  Raw and Component Materials

The manufacturing of the Process Equipment Group’s products involves the machining and welding of raw materials (primarily sheet metals and steel) and castings that are assembled with other component parts that generally require particular specifications or qualifications purchased from third-party suppliers.  Although most of these raw materials and components are generally available from several sources, some of these items are currently purchased from single sources.  Volatility in the prices the Process Equipment Group pays for raw materials used in its products, including sheet metals and steel, has a direct effect on profitability. The Process Equipment Group regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw and component material prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various pricing and sourcing actions.  In instances where third-party suppliers are depended upon for outsourced products or components, there is risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products sold due to supplier failure.  In addition, difficulties experienced by third-party suppliers can interrupt the ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately to supply products to customers.  Regardless, we believe the Process Equipment Group will generally be able to continue to obtain adequate supplies of key products or appropriate substitutes at reasonable costs.
Process Equipment Group:  Strategy

The Process Equipment Group seeks profitable growth through the following strategic initiatives: 

• | Strengthen leadership positions and build targeted platforms


• | Leverage core technologies and applications expertise to further penetrate current markets.


• | Grow platforms to critical mass in plastics and chemicals, food and pharmaceuticals, and separation to achieve benefits of leadership and scale.


• | Enter attractive new markets and near adjacencies with large addressable opportunities.


• | Leverage global footprint to expand customer base and win in new markets.


• | Drive innovation and new product development

• | Extend applications expertise to win in adjacent markets with high growth potential.


• | Develop new products driven by voice of customer input and changing needs.


• | Provide value-added end-to-end solutions from individual components to integrated systems.


• | Leverage HOM to drive margin expansion and profitable growth


• | Apply HOM tools, including voice of customer and segmentation, for profitable growth.


• | Drive best-in-class lead times to grow share in aftermarket parts and service business.


• | Implement strategic supplier relationships to improve cost and quality.


• | Enhance productivity through process standardization.

Batesville
Batesville® is a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America, where it has been designing, manufacturing, distributing, and selling funeral service products and solutions to licensed funeral directors operating licensed funeral homes for more than 100 years.  
Batesville:  Products and Services
As the needs of funeral professionals and consumers have evolved, Batesville has expanded its offerings with innovative products, value-added services, and digital tools to help funeral directors assist families in creating meaningful services.  Today, the company provides solutions under three primary platforms: (1) Burial Solutions, which accounts for the majority of Batesville’s revenue, (2) Cremation Options®, and (3) Technology Solutions. 

• | Burial Solutions


• | As a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America, Batesville has been on the forefront of product innovation for more than 70 years. The company has introduced new interior and exterior design elements, materials, finishes, and proprietary features that align with consumer trends and preferences, while adding value for funeral professionals and consumers. Batesville’s product portfolio covers the full spectrum in variety and value, with metal and wood caskets to appeal to different consumers. In addition to its product breadth, Batesville offers training, merchandising, and marketing materials to educate funeral directors and consumers on product and service options.


• | Cremation Options®


• | The Cremation Options® platform is focused on helping funeral professionals profitably serve the growing number of consumers choosing cremation. Batesville offers a broad line of cremation caskets, containers, urns, remembrance jewelry, and keepsakes. As with Burial Solutions, Batesville offers training, merchandising, and marketing resources to support funeral directors and consumers when selecting cremation. 


• | Technology Solutions


• | Batesville’s technology solutions enhance the consumer experience and create business efficiencies for over 6,000 funeral homes and cemeteries across North America. The company offers a suite of integrated, easy-to-use technology products and services, including funeral home websites, e-commerce solutions, digital selection and arrangement software, and business management systems for funeral homes and cemeteries.

Batesville also offers an expansive assortment of personalization and memorialization elements that can be incorporated into products and services to capture the individuality of the loved one and create a unique and meaningful experience for the family. Personalization is available on both burial and cremation products using Batesville’s proprietary LifeSymbols® designs, LifeStories® medallions and keepsakes, LifeView® panels, embroidered tribute panels, and MemorySafe® Drawer. Funeral directors can also create themed obituaries, personalize video tributes, and provide other tailored offerings for families using Batesville’s web technology.
Batesville:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations
Batesville-branded caskets are marketed by a direct sales force and through digital channels only to licensed funeral professionals operating licensed funeral establishments throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.  Batesville also markets its products to select independent distribution facilities as well as full-service funeral establishments offering funeral products in conformance with state law in states that do not have specific licensing requirements.
Batesville has sales contracts in place with certain national death care service providers and also serves more than 11,500 independent, privately owned funeral homes across North America.  None of Batesville’s customers accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated revenue during 2019.
Batesville:  Customer Preferences and Demographics
The death of a family member causes most people to seek the services of a state-licensed funeral director.  Although caskets and urns can be purchased from a variety of sources, including internet sellers and casket stores, the overwhelming majority of consumers who arrange a funeral purchase these products directly from a funeral home. Consumer spending on caskets and urns has not kept pace with inflation, negatively impacting product mix. We anticipate this trend in consumer spending will continue, which would result in mix decline in the foreseeable future.
Demand for Batesville products and services is partially impacted by a few key external factors: U.S. and Canadian population demographics, the number of deaths annually, and the rate at which consumers select cremation. The combination of these primary factors has negatively impacted the burial volume trend in recent years, although periodic fluctuations can impact demand and revenue in a given quarter and year. We anticipate the negative trend in burial demand will continue in the foreseeable future as the higher number of deaths among the aging post-World War II baby boomer generation is more than offset by the continued shift toward cremation. As a percentage of total deaths, the estimated cremation rate in 2019 was approximately 53% in the U.S. and 72% in Canada (Source: Cremation Association of North America).  
Batesville:  Competition
Batesville is a recognized leader in the death care industry, competing with several national and regional casket manufacturers, as well as more than 100 independent casket distributors, most of whom serve fairly narrow geographic segments.  Some non-traditional death care providers, such as large discount retail stores, casket stores, and internet casket retailers also sell caskets directly to consumers.  The industry has seen foreign manufacturers, mostly from China, import caskets into the U.S. and Canada.  Sales from these non-traditional and foreign providers collectively currently represent less than 10% of total casket sales in North America. We expect declining casket demand and existing domestic over-capacity to continue to put added economic pressures on casket manufacturers and distributors. 
Batesville:  Raw Materials and Working Capital
Batesville uses carbon and stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets, wood, fabrics, finishing materials, rubber gaskets, plastic, and zinc in the manufacture of its caskets.  Although most of these raw materials are generally available from several sources, some are currently procured from a single source.
Volatility in raw material prices due to inflation or tariffs, including steel, fuel, and petroleum-based products, has a direct effect on Batesville’s profitability.  The company generally does not engage in hedging transactions for these purchases but does enter into fixed-price supply contracts at times.  Batesville regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw material and fuel prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various sourcing actions.
Most of Batesville’s sales are made pursuant to supply agreements with its customers, and historically it has instituted annual price adjustments to help offset some, but not necessarily all, raw material cost increases.
Batesville maintains an adequate level of working capital to support the needs of its business. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements affecting working capital that are significant to understanding Batesville’s business.  
Batesville:  Strategy
While we believe there are opportunities to generate additional revenue within a wider range of death care products and services, sustaining volume in the burial casket space continues to be a top priority.  Batesville’s leadership team is focused on two strategic initiatives to sustain burial volume:

• | Grow leadership position in the death care industry


• | Focus on building and delivering value propositions that align with the needs of each customer segment to continue Batesville’s mission of helping families honor the lives of those they love®.


• | Use the HOM principles and tools to strengthen our leadership position and maintain an optimal cost structure to support profitability


• | Continually improve processes to be more consistent and efficient and to yield industry leading quality products and services that our customers value.

HILLENBRAND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We own a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes and maintain trade secrets related to manufacturing processes.  These patents and trade secrets are of importance, but we do not believe any single patent or trade secret or related group of patents or trade secrets is of material significance to our business as a whole.

However, we may not be sufficiently protected by our various patents, trademarks, and service marks, and they may be challenged, invalidated, cancelled, narrowed, or circumvented.  Beyond that, we may not receive the pending or contemplated patents, trademarks, or service marks for which we have applied or filed.

HILLENBRAND REGULATORY MATTERS

Both the Process Equipment Group and Batesville are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes.  We are committed to operating all our businesses in a manner that protects the environment and makes us good corporate citizens in the communities in which we operate.  While we believe that continued compliance with federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, future events or changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation may require us to make additional expenditures in the future.  The cost or need for any such additional expenditure is not known.
HILLENBRAND EMPLOYEES

At September 30, 2019, we had approximately 6,500 employees worldwide.  Approximately 3,000 employees were located within the U.S. and 3,500 employees were located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and China.  Approximately 2,800 employees in North America and Europe work under collective bargaining agreements.  Hillenbrand strives to maintain satisfactory relationships with all its employees, including the unions and workers’ councils representing those employees.  As a result, we have not experienced a significant work stoppage due to labor relations in more than 20 years.
