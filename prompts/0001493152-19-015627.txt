ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Corporation
 
Bunker Hill Mining Corp. (Formerly Liberty Silver Corp.) (the “Company” or the “Corporation”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada, U.S.A on February 20, 2007 under the name Lincoln Mining Corp. Pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment dated February 11, 2010, the Company changed its name to Liberty Silver Corp. On September 29, 2017, the Company changed its name to Bunker Hill Mining Corp. The Company’s registered office is located at 1802 N. Carson Street, Suite 212, Carson City Nevada 89701, and its head office is located at 401 Bay Street, Suite 2702, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 2Y4, and its telephone number is 416-477-7771.
Current Operations
 
Overview
 
The Company was incorporated for the purpose of engaging in mineral exploration and development activities. On August 28, 2017, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement (the “Agreement”) for the lease and option to purchase of the Bunker Hill Mine (the “Mine”) in Idaho. The “Bunker Hill Lease with Option to Purchase” is between the Company and Placer Mining Corporation (“Placer Mining”), the current owner of the Mine.
 
On October 2, 2018, the Company announced that it was in default of its Lease with Option to Purchase Agreement with Placer Mining. The default arose as a result of missed lease and operating cost payments, totaling $400,000, which were due at the end of September and on October 1, 2018. As per the Agreement, the Company had 15 days, from the date notice of default was provided (September 28, 2018), to remediate the default by making the outstanding payment. While Management worked with urgency to resolve this matter, Management was ultimately unsuccessful in remedying the default, resulting in the lease being terminated. On November 13, 2018, the Company announced that it was successful in renewing the lease.
 
The 24-month lease continues until October 31, 2019. The lease period can be extended by a further 12 months at the Company’s discretion. Under the revised terms of its agreement, during the term of the lease, the Company must make $60,000 monthly mining lease payments. A monthly amount of $140,000 is deferred and becomes payable if the Company exercises its purchase option, making the deferred amount payable. The Company is accruing for these payments and includes them in accounts payable.
 
The Company has an option to purchase the Bunker Hill Mine assets (“the Bunker Assets”) at any time before the end of the lease and any extension for a purchase price of $25 million with purchase payments to be made over a ten-year period. Under terms of the agreement, there is a 3% net smelter return royalty (“NSR”) on sales during the Lease and a 1.5% NSR on the sales after the purchase option is exercised, which post-acquisition NSR is capped at $60 million.
 
In addition to the payments to Placer Mining, pursuant to an agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) whereby for so long as Bunker leases, owns and/or occupies the Bunker Hill Mine, the Company will make payments to the EPA on behalf of the current owner in satisfaction of the EPA’s claim for cost recovery. These payments, if all are made, will total $20 million. The agreement calls for payments starting with $1 million 30 days after a fully ratified agreement was signed (which payment was made) followed by $2 million on November 1, 2018 and $3 million on each of the next 5 anniversaries with a final $2 million payment on November 1, 2024. In addition to these payments, the company is to make semi-annual payments of $480,000 on June 1 and December 1 of each year, to cover the EPA’s costs of maintaining the water treatment facility. The November 1 and December 1, 2018 payments were not made, and the Company is having discussions with the EPA to amend and defer payments.
 
Management believes this amended lease and option will provide the Company time to complete exploratory drilling, produce a mine plan and raise the money needed to move forward. Management continues to push forward and advance the time line to realizing shareholder value.
 
The Bunker Hill Mine was the largest producing mine in the Coeur d’Alene zinc, lead and silver mining district in northern Idaho. Historically, the mine produced over 35M tonnes of ore grading on average 8.76% lead, 3.67% zinc, and 155 g/t silver (Bunker Hill Mines Annual Report 1980).
 
The Company believes that there are numerous targets of opportunity left in the mine from top to bottom, and particularly on a strike to the west where more recent past drilling has resulted in major discoveries such as the Quill body of mineralized material.
 
The Bunker Hill Mine is the Company’s only focus, with a view to raising capital to rehabilitate the mine and put it back into production.

Products
 
The Bunker Hill Mine is a Zinc-Silver-Lead Mine. When back in production, the Company will mill mineralized material on-site or at a local third-party mill and plans to produce concentrates to be shipped to third party smelters for processing.
 
The Company will continue to explore the property with a view to proving resources.
 
Infrastructure
 
The acquisition of the Bunker Hill mine includes all mining rights and claims, surface rights, fee parcels, mineral interests, easements, existing infrastructure at Milo Gulch, and the majority of machinery and buildings at the Kellogg Tunnel portal level, as well as all equipment and infrastructure anywhere underground at the Bunker Hill Mine Complex. The acquisition also includes all current and historic data relating to the Bunker Hill Mine Complex, such as drill logs, reports, maps, and similar information located at the mine site or any other location.
Government Regulation and Approval
 
The current exploration activities and any future mining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, waste disposal, worker safety, mine construction, and protection of endangered and protected species. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
 
It is anticipated that it may be necessary to obtain the following environmental permits or approved plans prior to commencement of mine operations:
 

● | Reclamation and Closure Plan 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Water Discharge Permit 
● | Air Quality Operating Permit 
● | Industrial Artificial (tailings) pond permit 
● | Obtaining Water Rights for Operations 

Property Description
 
The Company’s agreement with Placer Mining Corporation includes mineral rights to 434 patented mining claims covering 5769.467 acres of those 35 include surface ownership over approximately 259.1 acres. The transaction also includes certain parcels of fee property which includes mineral and surface rights but are not patented mining claims. Mining claims and fee properties are located in Townships 47, 48 North, Range 2 East, Townships 47, 48 North, Range 3 East, Boise Meridian, Shoshone County, Idaho. The agreement specifically excludes the following: the Machine Shop Building and Parcel, including all fixed equipment located inside the building and personal property located upon the parcel; unmilled ore on deck and residual lead/zinc ore mined and broken, but not removed from the Bunker Hill Mine; the historic Caledonia Mine; the Crystal Vug; and the Silver Ridge exploration property.
 
Surface rights were originally owned by various previous owners of the claims until the acquisition of the properties by Bunker Limited Partners (“BLP”). BLP sold off surface rights to various parties over the years while maintaining access to conduct mining operations and exploration activities as well as easements to a cross over and access other of its properties containing mineral rights. Said rights were reserved to its assigns and successors in continuous perpetuity. Idaho Law also allows mineral right holders access to mine and explore for minerals on properties to which they hold minerals rights.
 
Title to all patented mining claims included in the transaction was transferred from Bunker Hill Mining Co. (U.S.) Inc. by Warranty Deed in 1992. The sale of the property was properly approved of by the U.S. Trustee and U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
 
Over 90% of surface ownership of patented mining claims not owned by Placer Mining Corp. is owned by different landowners. These include: Stimpson Lumber Co.; Riley Creek Lumber Co.; Powder LLC.; Golf LLC.; C & E Tree Farms; and Northern Lands LLC.
 
Patented mining claims in the State of Idaho do not require permits for underground mining activities to commence on private lands. Other permits associated with underground mining may be required, such as water discharge and site disturbance permits. The water discharge is being handled by the EPA at the existing water treatment plant. The Company expects to take on the water treatment responsibility in the future and obtain an appropriate discharge permit. If the Company is able to purchase the EPA’s water treatment plant the water discharge permit comes along with the water treatment plant.

Competition
 
The Company competes with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of mining claims and leases on zinc and other base and precious metals prospects as well as in connection with the recruitment and retention of qualified employees. Many of these companies are much larger than the Company, have greater financial resources and have been in the mining business for much longer than it has. As such, these competitors may be in a better position through size, finances and experience to acquire suitable exploration and development properties. The Company may not be able to compete against these companies in acquiring new properties and/or qualified people to work on its current project, or any other properties that may be acquired in the future.
 
Given the size of the world market for base precious metals such as silver, lead and zinc, relative to the number of individual producers and consumers, it is believed that no single company has sufficient market influence to significantly affect the price or supply of these metals in the world market.
 
Employees
 
The Company is currently managed by John Ryan, President and CEO and Wayne Parsons, Chief Financial Officer.
