 Description of Business
 The Company conducts its business activities in two distinct business segments, Material Handling and Distribution, consistent with the manner in which the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates performance and makes resource allocation decisions.
 In our Material Handling Segment, we design, manufacture, and market a variety of plastic and metal products. These range from plastic reusable material handling containers and small parts storage bins to plastic recreational vehicle (“RV”) tanks and parts, marine tanks and parts, portable plastic fuel tanks and water containers, portable marine fuel containers, ammunition containers, storage totes, bulk shipping containers and metal carts and cabinets. The Material Handling Segment conducts operations in the United States and Canada. Markets served include industrial manufacturing, food processing, retail/wholesale products distribution, agriculture, automotive, recreational vehicles, marine vehicles, healthcare, appliance, bakery, electronics, textiles, consumer, and others. Products are sold both directly to end-users and through distributors.

The Distribution Segment is engaged in the distribution of tools, equipment and supplies used for tire, wheel and undervehicle service on passenger, heavy truck and off-road vehicles and the manufacturing of tire repair materials and custom rubber products. The product line includes categories such as tire valves and accessories, lifts and alignment equipment, service equipment and tools, and tire repair/retread supplies. The Distribution Segment operates domestically through its sales offices and four regional distribution centers in the United States, and in certain foreign countries through export sales. In addition, the Distribution Segment operates directly in certain foreign markets, principally Central America, through foreign branch operations. Markets served include retail and truck tire dealers, commercial auto and truck fleets, auto dealers, general service and repair centers, tire retreaders, and government agencies.
 Information regarding the revenues of each segment classified as continuing operations is contained in the Industry Segments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report.
 In December 2017, the Company approved and completed the sale of its subsidiaries Myers do Brasil Embalagens Plasticas Ltda. and Plasticos Novel do Nordeste Ltda. (collectively, the “Brazil Business”) to allow the Company to focus resources on its core businesses and additional growth opportunities. The Brazil Business designed and manufactured reusable plastic shipping containers, plastic pallets, crates and totes used for closed loop-shipping and storage in Brazil’s automotive, distribution, food, beverage and agriculture industries. The operating results for the Brazil Business are classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under Items 6 and 8 of this report. The Brazil Business was part of the Material Handling Segment.
 During the second quarter of 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the commencement of the sale process to divest its Lawn and Garden business to allow it to focus resources on core growth platforms. The divestiture of the Lawn and Garden business was completed in February 2015 and was sold to an entity controlled by Wingate Partners V, L.P. (“L&G Buyer”) and is now named HC Companies, Inc. (“HC”). The Lawn and Garden business served the North American horticulture market with plastic products such as seedling trays, nursery products, hanging baskets, custom print containers as well as decorative resin planters. The operating results for the Lawn and Garden business are classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under Items 6 and 8 of this report.

Segments Overview
 Material Handling Segment
 The Material Handling Segment manufactures highly engineered polymer packaging containers, storage and safety products, and specialty molded parts. The brands within this segment include Buckhorn®, Akro-Mils™, Jamco Products, Ameri-Kart®, and Scepter.
 Buckhorn’s reusable containers and pallets are used in closed-loop supply chain systems to help customers improve product protection, increase handling efficiencies, reduce freight costs and eliminate solid waste and disposal costs.  Buckhorn offers products to replace costly single use cardboard boxes, wooden pallets, and steel containers. The product line is among the broadest in the industry and includes injection-molded and structural foam-molded constructions.  Buckhorn’s product lines include hand-held containers used for inventory control, order management and transportation of retail goods; collapsible and fixed-wall bulk transport containers for light and heavy-duty tasks; intermediate bulk containers for the storage and transport of food, liquid, powder, and granular products; plastic pallets; and specialty boxes designed for storage of items such as seed. Buckhorn also produces a wide variety of specialty products designed for niche applications and custom products designed according to exact customer specifications.
 Akro-Mils material handling products provide customers everything they need to store, organize and transport a wide range of goods while increasing overall productivity and profitability.  Serving industrial and commercial markets, Akro-Mils products range from AkroBins® — the industry’s leading small parts bins — to Super-Size AkroBins, metal panel and bin hanging systems, metal storage cabinet and bin systems, wire shelving systems, plastic and metal transport carts and a wide variety of custom storage and transport products. Akro-Mils products deliver storage and organization solutions in a wide variety of applications, from creating assembly line workstations to organizing medical supplies and retail displays. Emphasis is placed on product bundling and customizing systems to create specific storage and organization configurations for customers’ operations. 
 Jamco Products is well established in industrial and commercial markets with its wide selection of welded steel service carts, platform trucks, mobile work centers, racks and cabinets for plastic bins, safety cabinets, medical cylinder carts and more. Jamco Products’ strong product offering, relationships with industrial distributors and reputation for quality and service complements Myers Industries’ existing Material Handling businesses.
 Ameri-Kart is an industry leading manufacturer and thermoformer of rotational-molded water, fuel and waste handling tanks, plastic trim and interior parts used in the production of seat components, consoles, and other applications throughout the recreational vehicle, marine, and industrial markets.  In addition to standard marine parts, Ameri-Kart is well respected within the marine market for its patented Enviro-Fill® overfill prevention system (“OPS”) technology and is the industry’s only turnkey provider of an integrated, Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)-compliant marine fuel tank and patented Enviro-Fill diurnal system. 
 Scepter is a leading producer of portable plastic fuel containers, portable marine fuel tanks and water containers, ammunition containers and storage totes.  Scepter was the first provider of Jerry Cans to North America which offer safe, reliable transportation and storage of fuel for the consumer market.  Scepter also manufactures a variety of molded products for military applications from high quality containers to safely store and transport large caliber ammunition, to military specified portable fuel and water canisters. Scepter's in-house product engineering and state of the art mold capabilities complements Myers Industries’ Material Handling Segment through an increased product offering and global reach.
 Distribution Segment
 Our Distribution Segment includes the Myers Tire Supply®, Myers Tire Supply International™ and Patch Rubber Company® brands.  Within the Distribution Segment we source and manufacture top of the line products for the tire, wheel and undervehicle service industry.
 Myers Tire Supply is the largest U.S. distributor and single source for tire, wheel and undervehicle service tools, equipment and supplies. We buy and sell over 10,000 different items — everything that professionals need to service passenger, truck and off-road tires, wheels and related components. Independent tire dealers, mass merchandisers, commercial auto and truck fleets, auto dealerships, tire retreaders and general repair facilities rely on our broad product selection, rapid availability and personal service to be more productive and profitably grow their business. Myers Tire Supply International further distributes these product offerings in Central America, through its branch offices, and to other foreign countries, through its U.S. export business.
 While the needs and composition of our distribution markets constantly change, we adapt and deliver new products and services that are crucial to our customers’ success. The new product pipeline is driven by a thorough understanding of the market and its customers’ needs. Myers Tire Supply in turn works closely with its suppliers to develop innovative products and services to meet these needs.

Patch Rubber Company manufactures one of the most comprehensive lines of tire repair and retreading products in the United States. Service professionals rely on our extensive product selection and quality for safe, cost-effective repairs to passenger, truck and off-road tires. Products include the plug that fills a puncture, the cement that seals the plug, the tire innerliner patch and the final sealing compound. Patch brand repair products maintain a strong position in the tire service markets including sales through the Myers Tire Supply sales network.  Patch Rubber also employs its rubber calendering and compounding expertise to create a diverse portfolio of products outside of the tire repair market, such as reflective highway marking tapes. Our rubber-based tape and symbols provide the durability and brightness that construction professionals demand to replace paint for marking road repair, intersections and hazardous areas. Compared with traditional highway paint, the tape stock is easier to apply, more reflective and longer lasting.
 Raw Materials & Suppliers 
 The Company purchases substantially all of its raw materials from a wide range of third-party suppliers. These materials are primarily polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene plastic resins, all used within the Material Handling Segment, as well as synthetic and natural rubber. Most raw materials are commodity products and available from several domestic suppliers. We believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Our Distribution Segment purchases substantially all of its components from third-party suppliers and has multiple sources for its products.
 Competition
 Competition in our Material Handling Segment is substantial and varied in form and size from manufacturers of similar products and of other products which can be substituted for those produced by the Company. In general, most direct competitors with the Company’s brands are private entities. Myers Industries maintains strong brand presence and market positions in the niche sectors of the markets it serves. The Company does not command substantial, overall market presence in the broad market sectors.
 Competition in our Distribution Segment is generally comprised of small companies, regional players and national auto parts chains where product offerings may overlap. Within the overall tire, wheel and undervehicle service market, Myers Industries is the largest U.S. distributor of tools, equipment and supplies offered based on national coverage.
 Customer Dependence
 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no customers that accounted for more than ten percent of total net sales from continuing operations. Myers Industries serves thousands of customers who demand value through product selection, innovation, quality, delivery and responsive personal service. Our brands foster satisfied, loyal customers who have recognized our performance through numerous supplier quality awards.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, Myers Industries had a total of approximately 1,800 full-time and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 1,240 were employed in the Company’s Material Handling Segment and the Distribution Segment employed approximately 510. The Company’s corporate offices had approximately 50 employees.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 140 employees represented by a labor union. The collective bargaining agreement between us and the labor union expires June 2019. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory.
 Backlog
 The backlog of orders for our operations is estimated to have been approximately $47 million at December 31, 2018 and approximately $54 million at December 31, 2017. Generally, our lead time between customer order and product delivery is less than 90 days, and thus our estimated backlog is substantially expected to be delivered within the succeeding three months. During periods of shorter lead times, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future sales. Accordingly, we do not believe our backlog data and comparisons thereof, as of different dates, reliably indicate future sales or shipments.
