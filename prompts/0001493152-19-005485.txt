ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Transportation and Logistics Systems, Inc. (“TLSS”), formerly PetroTerra Corp., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, on July 25, 2008.
 
On March 30, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), TLSS and Save On Transport Inc., (“Save On”) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of the same date (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, on the Closing Date, Save On became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TLSS (the “Reverse Merger”). Save On was incorporated in the state of Florida and started business on July 12, 2016 (“Inception Date”). Save On is a provider of integrated transportation management solutions consisting of brokerage and logistic services such as transportation scheduling, routing and other value added services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight. As an early stage company, TLSS’s current operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise
 
The Share Exchange was treated as a reverse merger and recapitalization of Save On for financial reporting purposes since the Save On shareholders retained an approximate 80% controlling interest in the post-merger consolidated entity. Save On was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the Company’s historical financial statements before the Merger was replaced with the historical financial statements of Save On before the Merger. The balance sheets at their historical cost basis of both entities were combined at the merger date and the results of operations from the merger date forward include the historical results of Save On and results of TLSS from the merger date forward. The Merger was intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
On June 18, 2018 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Prime EFS, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“Prime”), from its members pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into among the Company and the Prime members on the Closing Date (the “SPA”). Prime is a New Jersey based transportation company with a focus on deliveries for on-line retailers in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
 
On July 24, 2018, the Company formed Shypdirect LLC (“Shypdirect”), a company organized under the laws of New Jersey. Shypdirect is a transportation company with a focus on tractor trailer and box truck deliveries of product on the east coast of the United States from one distributor’s warehouse to another warehouse or from a distributor’s warehouse to the post office.
 
TLSS and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Save On, Prime and Shypdirect are hereafter referred to as the “Company”. Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 2833 Exchange Court, West Palm Beach, Florida 33409, and our telephone number is [(561) 801-9188.
 
Company Overview
 
We generate our revenues through three subsidiaries, Prime, Shypdirect, and Save On.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, and for the period from January 1, 2018 to June 18, 2018, we operated in one reportable business segment consisting of brokerage and logistic services such as transportation scheduling, routing and other value added services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight. Since June 18, 2018, we operated in three reportable business segments - (1) the transportation of automobiles and other freight (the “Save On” segment), (2) a segment which concentrates on deliveries for on-line retailers in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (the “Prime” segment), and (3) a segment with a focus on tractor trailer and box truck deliveries of product on the east coast of the United States from one distributor’s warehouse to another warehouse or from a distributor’s warehouse to the post office (the “Shypdirect segment).
 
Prime and Shypdirect provide multiple services involving movement of goods through e-commerce. We focus primarily on the transportation of packages that are ultimately to be delivered to the business or retail consumer, with our transportation services going from the manufacturer or fulfillment center to the delivery station and from the delivery station to the end user (known as the “last mile” deliveries).
 
Save On is a Florida based non-asset provider of integrated transportation management solutions. Through Save On, we provide brokerage and logistics services such as transportation scheduling, routing and other value added services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight, which involve the use of independent contractor-owned trucks and equipment.
 
E-Commerce Fulfillment Solutions
 
The rapid growth of e-commerce and the online retailing segment of e-commerce is well documented. Our technology platform positions us to provide transportation services and grow at or faster than the rapidly growing and evolving e-commerce marketplace.
 
Online retail brands have logistics needs that differ from those of traditional businesses. Unlike traditional inventory management, e-commerce companies need to ship items directly to customers, who expect their orders to arrive on time and as described. We have built our delivery services to perform effectively in the “on demand” shipping environment that is part of the e-commerce fulfillment solutions system.

Our e-commerce fulfillment solutions are primarily the transportation of goods between destination points along the way from the manufacturer to the customer. We provide delivery services to the end user ( “Last Mile” delivery), principally retail consumers, including deliveries which require two persons to complete the delivery of heavy or bulky items, as well as “mid-mile” delivery services between distribution centers and fulfillment centers and line-haul delivery services from the manufacturer to the distribution center. Our revenues are generated from the fixed price charged for each specific route between a delivery station to a fulfillment center or from the fulfillment center to the final destination with a fixed price per route. We currently provide the majority of our services for a leading e-commerce retailer.
 
In most instances we are paid a fixed fee for transporting products from one designated site to a specified delivery point without regard to the number of packages being transported. With the ongoing growth of e-commerce the specific routes between designated sites is regularly changing (primarily increasing) as the volume of the online retailing segment of e-commerce activity expands. An integral part of our strategy is to regularly be in contact with our customers to assure that we are anticipating and planning for the expansion of current routes and the addition of new routes to our service base.
 
The transportation network for the e-commerce marketplace is also referred to as supply chain management. Our services within the supply chain management include transportation and logistics. The e-commerce marketplace has changed the shipping and logistics performance requirements, metrics and expectations. While we are an integral part of one of the world’s largest e-commerce retailers, we anticipate that our fulfillment services will expand to include outside third parties that are utilizing our customer’s infrastructure.
 
We have built a network operations center (“NOC”) in Jersey City, New Jersey that allows us to track the location of each of our vehicles and address any on road disruptions. Our NOC is designed to grow with our business as we add more vehicles for additional routes and expand geographically. Presently, we utilize our NOC solely for our own business. We anticipate that as our revenues grow and the reach and scope of our transportation activities expand (both geographically and within the tristate area in which we currently operate) that we will generate revenues from services provided via our NOC to other parties.
 
Our infrastructure is built to support the e-commerce unique fulfillment requirements of distributing products to millions of homes instead of hundreds of stores, managing millions of stock keeping units (SKUs) instead of thousands, shipping to homes in parcels instead of truckloads to stores and transporting between fulfillment centers in addition to distribution centers. Our infrastructure is aligned with the requirements of the online retailer: Online retailers differ from traditional brick and mortar where customers visit the premises and the retailer maintains goods on the premises. Online retailers have goods located in multiple locations (3rd party warehouse, etc.) and ships items directly to the customer; customers expect their order to arrive on time and be the correct quantity and product ordered.
 
With our focus on on-time performance, customer satisfaction and challenging growth management opportunities for our employees, we believe we are one of the fastest growing e-commerce fulfillment services providers in the country. As an early stage company, we have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience the challenges that come from rapid growth in revenues such as identifying and hiring employees that are aligned with our expectations, securing assets and expanding our administrative support services for our rapidly growing operations. We believe that our ability to manage our company through this high growth is a key part of our success, as evidenced by the high performance ratings we have regularly achieved in our customers’ scoring systems. We expect to expand our revenue base as the traditional brick and mortar retailers develop omni-channel strategies of generating revenues through a combination of physical and online sales.
 
Automobile Transportation
 
At Save On, we do not own the trucks or other equipment used to transport freight. Instead we utilize our relationships with subcontracted transportation providers – typically independent contract motor carriers. However, we utilize carrier services of an affiliate entity for transportation services within Florida. We make a profit on the difference between what we charge our customers for the services we provide and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport our customers’ freight. Our success depends in large part on our ability to hire and train talented salespeople and deploy them under exceptional leaders, develop sophisticated information technology, and build relationships with the carriers in our network so that we can purchase the optimal transportation solutions for our customers. Currently, all of our revenues are derived from domestic shipments.
Our Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
Our strategy is to provide on-time, high quality pick-up, transportation and delivery services. An important part of our strategy is the use of technology to plan, execute and monitor the performance of our services and transportation assets.
 
We have built and positioned our Company to grow at or faster than the rate e-commerce fulfillment solutions are growing. This will allow us to diversify our revenue base in conjunction with growing our revenue base. We plan on continuing our organic growth and growing through the acquisition of carriers that will provide us with geographic expansion.
 
While Prime has been in business for less than three years (Prime was founded in July 2016), we believe our youth as a business is a competitive advantage because we have been and continue to be focused on transportation services as part of the e-commerce fulfillment solutions. These solutions are in high demand and expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace. We believe we understand the various segments of the end-to-end solutions required to rapidly and accurately deliver goods between the various pick-up and delivery points in the e-commerce delivery chain. While we will focus on diversifying our revenue sources, we will continue to be principally focused on growing our transportation services that are part of the e-commerce fulfillment solutions required for the e-commerce marketplace.

Many of our management employees have e-commerce experience with e-commerce retailers and understand the dynamics of e-commerce growth, demands and logistics since all or the vast majority of their career has been in e-commerce businesses. In addition to the youthful, while experienced e-commerce management, we also have the competitive advantage of not having the legacy structure of the older, larger companies that existed before the e-commerce marketplace became popular.
 
Many of our transportation assets were initially utilized for a single route per day. As we expand, we have been able to increase utilization through use of assets on multiple routes or the addition of a second shift per day.
 
Our scheduled route system allows us to adjust to the regular changes in which packages are received, sorted, stored, picked, packed, shipped and housed in fulfillment centers and distribution centers. We are structured to meet the demands of “last-mile” deliveries and home grocery shopping deliveries. In addition to delivering goods in full truckloads from distribution centers to fulfillment centers, based on customer requests, we perform unscheduled pickups and deliveries of bulk products. When delivering packages to a home, we adhere to certain time slots and sometimes make “live deliveries” to ensure the customer is aware that their package has been delivered. This entails a constantly refreshed and technologically modern transportation management system (TMS).
 
In our automobile transportation services our growth strategy focuses on developing a full suite of automobile transportation brokerage and logistics solutions for our customers. Our service offerings consist of non-asset based transportation supply chain management, logistics and brokerage solutions. We facilitate cost-effective vehicle shipping for customers for a variety of reasons including:
 

● | Household moves; 
--+-----------------------------------------
● | Seasonal moves; 
● | Military moves; 
● | College moves; 
● | Company relocation; 
● | Internet automobile purchases; 
● | Classic car and collector shows; and 
● | Transportation for car dealerships. 

 
Save On differentiates itself from the competition and grows its business by sustaining a high level of customer service, offering expedited and time-definite services, while providing competitive pricing.
 
Technology
 
An integral part of our operating philosophy is the utilization of technology to support our transportation services and provide our employees with real time information on the status of our operations. We believe our focus on technology as a support to our operations allows our employees to focus on performing at high levels for the benefit of our customers.
 
Each of our vehicles contain mobile communications devices. By being “always-connected”, we are able to monitor the real time location, performance and effectiveness of our drivers as well as the operating condition of the vehicle. The advancements in what is referred to as the telematic space allow us to develop more detailed and actionable solutions in the performance of our pick-up, transport and deliver operations – all an integral part of our e-commerce fulfillment solutions.
 
We regularly collect data, generate automatic reporting and measure that information against key performance indicators such as routes taken, travel time, destination arrival and departure time. Just as the e-commerce retailer instantaneously and continuously tracks what has been sold, our vehicles are tracked in parallel with the packages being tracked by our customer. Our NOC is designed to be scalable and will be expanded in reach and performance capability as our revenues grow and our assets increase in number.
 
Customers and Markets
 
Our e-commerce retailer delivery services are principally for a leading e-commerce online retailer. We have a concentration risk which we shall address by expanding our organic growth through the addition of new customers and through the acquisition of businesses that provide transportation services for new customer bases. Our automobile transportation services are provided to businesses and individuals.
 
Our package delivery services are currently provided primarily in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania while our automobile transportation services are provided from and to destinations through the contiguous forty-eight states.
 
We anticipate our customer base will expand and diversify as the business-to-business segment of e-commerce expands, and the traditional retailers implement e-commerce strategies that expand their sales channels. We anticipate our fulfillment solutions will become available to other retailers that utilize our principal customers’ expanding transportation and delivery services in which our system is an integral part.

Competition
 
Transportation services is highly competitive and composed of fragmented marketplaces, with multiple companies competing in the geographic region in which we provide services. We compete on service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities and price. Our competitors include local, regional and national companies that offer the same services we provide — some with larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we have. Additionally, some of our customers have internal resources that can perform services we offer. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, we must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
 
The health of the transportation industry will continue to be a function of domestic economic growth, particularly in the e-commerce marketplace. We believe that we have positioned the Company to grow with and benefit from the e-commerce expansion. Together with our scale, technology and company-specific initiatives, we believe that our positioning should keep us growing faster than the macro environment.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our calendar year fourth quarter, which ends December 31st. Our gross revenue was 58% higher during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2018 results include revenue attributable to Shypdirect, which we founded on July 24, 2018.
Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies. These regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
 
Regulation Affecting Motor Carriers, Owner-Operators and Transportation Brokers. In the United States, our subsidiaries that operate as motor carriers have motor carrier licenses issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). In addition, our subsidiaries acting as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA. Our motor carrier subsidiaries and the third-party motor carriers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those related to drug-testing, alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to emissions, drivers’ hours-of-service, independent contractor eligibility requirements, onboard reporting of operations, air cargo security and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our equipment, operations and independent contractor drivers. Like our third-party support carriers, we are subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements in certain states and local jurisdictions where we operate. In foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our operations are regulated by the appropriate governmental authorities.
 
In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs.”
 
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, this development is likely to be temporary. As a result, our fleet could be ranked worse or better than our competitors, and the safety ratings of our motor carrier operations could be impacted. Our network of third-party transportation providers may experience a similar result. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
In addition, nearly all carriers and drivers that are required to maintain records of duty status have been required to install and use electronic logging devices (“ELDs”). ELD installation and use may increase costs for independent contractors and other third-party support carriers who provide services to XPO and may impact driver recruitment.
 
Classification of Independent Contractors. Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as private litigants, continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements and heighten the penalties for companies who misclassify workers and are found to have violated overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers that meet certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a longstanding, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if said non-employees are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an employee or a non-employee; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirement and/or for misclassifications. Some states have launched initiatives to increase revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and the reclassification of independent contractors as employees could help states with those initiatives. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determinations of independent contractor status. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, and labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.

Environmental Regulations. Our facilities and operations and our independent contractors are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, emissions from vehicles, engine-idling, fuel tanks and related fuel spillage and seepage, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters that involve inherent environmental risks. Similar laws and regulations may apply in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We may be responsible for the cleanup of any spill or other incident involving hazardous materials caused by our operations or business. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of cleanup of diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events, and none of these incidents materially affected our business or operations. We generally transport only hazardous materials rated as low-to-medium-risk, and a small percentage of our total shipments contains hazardous materials. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. Future changes in environmental regulations or liabilities from newly discovered environmental conditions or violations (and any associated fines and penalties) could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, potentially limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in higher costs for new tractors and trailers, reduced productivity and efficiency, and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, we have one full time employee, our chief executive officer, whose salary is paid by Save On. Save On has six (6) additional full-time employees, Prime EFS has 500 employees, most of which are full-time and Shypdirect has 35 employees, most of which are full time.
Marketing and Significant Customers
 
A vast majority of our Prime EFS and Shypdirect revenue comes from one large ecommerce retailer. Save On customers are primarily different and distinct individuals and dealerships introduced through referral sources. Our business serves the North American market, with a total concentration in the United States.
 
To best serve our Save On customers, we will need to hire and maintain a significant staff of sales representatives and related support personnel. Our sales strategy is twofold: we seek to establish long-term relationships with new accounts and to increase the amount of business generated from our existing customer base. We believe that these attributes are competitive advantages in the transportation and logistics industry.
 
Information Systems
 
We utilize two main cloud based information systems for our Save On Business: jTracker for taking customer orders and Central Dispatch for posting orders for carrier communications. Prime and Shypdirect use a suite of non-proprietary software programs and other technologies to manage dispatching of vehicles, employees, Department of Transportation compliance, vehicle maintenance, and scheduling.
Competition
 
The transportation and logistics industry is highly competitive, with thousands of companies competing in the domestic and international markets. Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies with the same services that our business provides. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, our business units must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
 
We compete on service, reliability and price. Some competitors have larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we do. The health of the transportation and logistics industry will continue to be a function of domestic and global economic growth.
 
Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 2833 Exchange Court, Suite A, West Palm Beach, Florida 33409, comprised of 400 square feet of office space. The company executed a sublease agreement with an affiliate for office space for a one-year term. The sublease commenced on August 1, 2016 at a rate of $300 a month. The sublease was extended on August 1, 2017 and terminated on December 14, 2017, at which point the Company signed a new one-year term lease with the third-party landlord directly for the entire space previously occupied by the affiliate. The monthly rent under the renewed lease is $1,600 plus maintenance charges and taxes. The Company also has office space in Northern New Jersey that it rents on a month to month basis.
 
On November 30, 2018, we entered into a commercial lease agreement for the lease of sixty parking spaces under an operating lease through November 2023 for a monthly rental fee of $6,000. Either party can cancel this lease on the annual anniversary date of the lease provided that the party who wishes to terminate provides the other party with at least 30-day prior written notice of such termination.
 
In December 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for the lease of office and warehouse space and parking spaces under a non-cancelable operating lease through December 2023. From the lease commencement date until the last day of the second lease year, monthly rent shall be $14,000. At the beginning of the 30th month following the commencement date and through the end of the term, minimum rent shall be $14,420 per month. The Company shall have one option to renew the term of this lease for an additional five years.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
 
How to Obtain our SEC Filings
 
We file annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Reports, proxy statements and other information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
