--------+----------

Overview
 
HF Foods Group Inc. acting through its subsidiaries (“HF Foods,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a foodservice distributor operated by Chinese Americans, providing Chinese restaurants, primarily Chinese takeout restaurants located in the southeastern United States, with good quality food and supplies at competitive prices. Since our inception in 1997, fueled by increasing demand in the Chinese foods market segment, which our management believes is highly fragmented with unsophisticated competitors and has natural cultural barriers, we have grown our business and currently serve approximately 3,200 restaurant customers in ten states with our deep understanding of Chinese Culture and our business know-how in the Chinese community.
 
Chinese takeout restaurants are located in most, if not all, urban and suburban areas in the United States. They focus on serving Chinese cuisine mainly to non-Chinese Americans. Our management believes that, for the most part, these takeout restaurants are operated by individual families with very few workers, and over 80% of the restaurants we service are owned by Chinese Americans from Fuzhou (“Fuzhouese”), the province capital of Fujian, China. The industry has been able to grow rapidly because it provides good food at low cost and in a convenient way. We offer an array of specialty Chinese foods and supplies that are not widely available elsewhere. By becoming a one-stop-shopping location for our customers, we have made it more difficult for small competitors to enter this market. As a way to focus our efforts, we concentrate on serving primarily the fast growing Chinese restaurants in the southeastern region of the United States. With natural cultural barriers, we are able to maintain market position with our core customers and compete effectively against large competitors serving mainstream restaurants, like Sysco and US Food Services, who have not effectively penetrated this market segment.
 
In the past 20 years of operation, we have developed distribution channels throughout the southeastern United States. We have three distribution centers located in Greensboro, North Carolina, Ocala, Florida, and Atlanta Georgia. We have developed a proprietary information system for management of customer relationships and inventory management and are able to sustain our growth partly because of this information system. We also use a call-center located in China, which allows us to serve our customers on a 24-hour basis in their native language, while lowering the administrative cost in the United States. Supported by technology, we have been able to support our growing customer base and, at the same time, keep operating costs low. By utilizing private networks, we have linked our Greensboro headquarters with both our other distribution centers and our outsourced call center in China. This communication system allows us to communicate seamlessly both internally and externally with our customers.
 
Development of Business
 
We were founded by Zhou Min Ni and his wife, Chan Sin Wong in 1997. They came to the United States from Fuzhou, the provincial capital of Fujian, China. Like many other Fuzhouese, they started by working in Chinese takeout restaurants. After gaining experience, they established their own takeout restaurants in North Carolina. From the experience of operating Chinese takeout restaurants, they realized there was a great potential in the business of providing supplies to takeout restaurants.
 
The Company was founded in Kernersville, North Carolina in a 3,000-square-foot warehouse. In 2001, we opened a warehouse in Florida to further expand our reach to the southeastern United States. In 2003, we purchased a warehouse in Greensboro, North Carolina to support growing customer demand. In June 2005, we started to outsource our sales and customer services to a call center in China, which allows us to operate on a 24-hour basis and provides a solid platform for expansion. In late 2005, we opened a warehouse in Atlanta, Georgia. We acquired HD Food Service, a wholesaler operated in Winston Salem, North Carolina, in late 2008. This successful acquisition resulted in business expansion and sales growth.

Business Model and Competitive Advantage
 
We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of products at competitive prices. Since inception, we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors with our distinctive product portfolio, supplier relationships, locations, and technology. Our wide range of product offerings sets us apart from other mainstream competitors such as Sysco and US Foods, as many of the items we offer are specific to the Chinese restaurant industry. More importantly, our relationships with our suppliers allow us to procure a large variety of products in volume at a low cost. We also import specialized items that would be difficult to procure domestically. With three warehouses and over one hundred trucks executing daily routes within 200 miles of our distribution centers, we offer our customers prompt delivery of high quality products.
 
We believe that the following elements of our business model provide us with a competitive advantage and has resulted in our success:
 

● | We offer a wide array of specialty products that are not widely provided by large distributors serving the mainstream market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have a deep understanding of Chinese Culture and most of our employees can speak the native language of our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We outsource our sales and customer service to a call center located in China serving our customers in Chinese, which incurs lower administrative expenses and operates efficiently.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We capitalize on economies of scale, giving us strong negotiating power with suppliers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have developed a sophisticated infrastructure with three distribution centers and a fleet of well-maintained trucks for prompt delivery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | With the self-developed proprietary information system, we are able to manage our customer relationships and inventory efficiently and reduce operating expenses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have over 20 years of successful operational experience and a record of successful acquisitions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to strategically consolidate our market segment by acquiring competitors, including other distributors and wholesalers, to expand our business into untapped regions around the United States and to eventually grow into a nationwide foodservice distributor. We will continue to invest in the management technology system to further improve our operational efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. We will also explore value-added products such as semi-prepared products to help our customers upgrade their service.
 
Industry and Market Analysis
 
We distribute food and supplies to Chinese/Asian restaurants, primarily Chinese takeout restaurants that mainly serve non-Chinese Americans, which is a niche market segment of the foodservice distribution industry. The foodservice industry in the U.S. is generally large and has a long history, with several large players such as Sysco Corporation, US Foods Holding Corp. and Performance Food Group Company, each serving a significant market share of the industry by offering a broad line of products and services, or carrying specific products for large chains. However, they do not generally serve Chinese restaurants.
Chinese/Asian Takeout Restaurants
 
Set forth below are the principal characteristics of the Chinese/Asian take-out restaurants we serve.
 
Primarily Serving Non-Chinese Americans. There are tens of thousands of Chinese takeout restaurants spread across the U.S., which primarily serve non-Chinese American customers. Although the products they serve cater to the preferences of a wide American mainstream of customers and are more simply prepared when compared with traditional well-served Chinese restaurant cuisine, they still maintain typical Chinese ingredients and cooking styles.

Operated by Fuzhouese Individual Families. Over 80% of the Chinese takeout restaurants we service are operated and owned by individual families with very few (two or three) workers. The owners usually are the first or second generation of Fuzhouese, Chinese American from Fuzhou, the province capital of Fujian, China. These takeout restaurants have very limited resources and appreciate value-added service to help them improve their operational efficiency. The owners and workers in the Chinese takeout restaurants usually speak Mandarin or the Fuzhou dialect, their regional dialect. Understanding the Chinese Culture and language is important for efficient communication with these customers.
Close-held Chinese American Community. Second or third generation Chinese Americans living in the U.S. inherit their traditional cultural, and ethnic languages, and we believe that people in these communities prefer to do business with Chinese Americans as opposed to other ethnic groups if they have a choice.
Unique Cooking Style and Ingredients for Chinese Cuisines. Chinese cuisine requires unique cooking styles such as steaming and wokking, and requires specialty ingredients and vegetables such as bitter melons, Chinese yams, vine spinach, Chinese cabbage and winter melon. They also use Chinese and Asian seasonings and spices including peanut oil, cooking wine, vinegar, dark soy source, black bean sauce, pepper oil and chili oil. Most of the unique ingredients for Chinese cuisine are not widely available from mainstream U.S. suppliers.
Growth Potential
 
Growing Consumption Trend for Food Away from Home. According to the National Restaurant Association, the percentage of Americans who prefer to have food away from home increased from 41.2% in 2014 to 43.8% in 2016. Our management believes the trend of consuming food away from home also represents a potential increase of demand for Chinese takeout restaurants.
More Recognition by Americans of Chinese Cuisines. With the growing influence of China’s economy and culture, more and more Americans are consuming Chinese cuisines. The management of the Company has seen increasing demand for Chinese cuisine and believe it will bring expansion opportunities for Chinese restaurants, and thus the food distribution industry.
Current Industry Landscape and Opportunities
 
Natural Culture Barriers to Entry. Understanding Chinese cooking culture is important to run a Chinese restaurant and, therefore, most Chinese takeout restaurants are operated by Chinese Americans, especially Fuzhouese. It is very difficult for mainstream food distributors to serve these restaurants because of cultural and language barriers.
Highly Fragmented Market Segment. The market is currently highly fragmented with many unsophisticated competitors and there is no recognized industry leader nationwide. Most participants are small players such as wholesalers, specialty import brokers, farmers markets, and local produce retailers without the support of sophisticated logistics infrastructure. We believe we are the only Chinese food distributor operating in the southeastern United States with a well-developed logistics infrastructure and experienced management team and that the fragmented market gives us the opportunity to consolidate the market and develop a dominant market position.
Infrastructure Barriers for New Entrants. The food distribution industry requires large capital investment and resources to build a logistics infrastructure with warehouses and a fleet of trucks to cover its distribution network. In addition, larger suppliers have greater negotiating power with vendors and price advantages for customers.
 
Demand for Value-Added Services. Our customers are Chinese/Asian restaurants, primarily takeout restaurants. Usually, these restaurants are relatively small with only approximately 1,000 square feet and are operated by family members with very few workers. Most of them are open seven days a week, twelve hours a day. These customers are price and quality sensitive and prefer large suppliers with scale economies providing competitive prices for products. Given the limited labor forces and resources of these restaurants, most desire to have more value-added services from the suppliers to help them to operate more efficiently.
 
 5



In sum, we see a great opportunity for market consolidation. We believe we have advantages to address the current market imperfections and become a national leader in the niche market. With economies of scale, we can provide high quality products at competitive prices in an efficient way.
 
Business Model
 
Our business model features an integrated structure with three distribution centers with 400,000 square feet of total storage space, a fleet of 105 refrigerated vehicles for short-distance delivery, 12 tractors and 17 trailers for long-haul operations, and centralized inventory management and procurement, supported by an outsourced call center located in China for customer relationship management. We offer a variety of high quality products at competitive prices to our customers. Customers can benefit from our efficient supply chain to support such customer’s growth.
 
We offer one-stop service to Chinese restaurants with over 1,000 types of products, including fresh and frozen meats, Chinese specialty vegetables, sauces, and packaging materials for takeout restaurants. Chinese restaurants, especially small or takeout restaurants, can find almost all the products they need in our product lists, which can help them to save their workload to manage their purchase of inventory. We use an outsourced call center in Fuzhou, China, with 24 hour availability for sales and marketing, order placement and post-sales service, which reduces our operating costs, and offers service in Mandarin and Fuzhou dialect, in addition to English.
 
With 20 years of operations, we have established a large supplier network and we maintain long-term relationships with many major suppliers. The procurement team is led by Zhou Min Ni, CEO of the Company, who has a deep insight in the industry. The centralized procurement management system gives us negotiating power given the large procurement quantities, improves our turnover of inventory and account payables, and reduces our operating costs.

Products
 
We offer a wide range of products with over 1,000 products for the Chinese/Asian restaurants, primarily Chinese takeout restaurants. Products range from perishable produce to takeout food packaging materials. To meet our customers’ demands, we have a large variety and a complete line of products in our inventory. Eighty percent of sales volume currently consists of domestic goods such as frozen meat and vegetables, which are procured through large suppliers or directly from the producer.

Customer Service
 
We use an outsourced call center located in China to manage our sales order, customer development, sales promotion and post-sales services. The outsourced call center is located in Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province of China, with local employees speaking Mandarin, Fuzhounese and English. By offering the customer service in their native language, the sales persons can communicate smoothly and efficiently with our customers and understand what the customers need. With cultural understanding and a common language, sales people can design a product portfolio for our customers and use a precision marketing strategy to promote our products. The location of the outsourced call center controls costs by employing skilled sales persons at lower wages in China as compared with the U.S.
 
Currently, we maintain our sales department, including decision making for sales strategies and supervision of sales performance by its key sales managers, in our headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina. The sales managers work closely with the sales persons in China to ensure our sales strategies are exactly implemented. Our plan is to further integrate our operating model with the outsourced call center to expand our business and operate more efficiently.
 
A proprietary information system is used to maintain the customers’ record, including location, size, contact information, purchasing history, preference, order and payment record. Customers can directly call the outsourced call center in China to inquire about products and place orders. Once orders are confirmed, electronic sales orders are generated by the information system and sent to the distribution center closest to the customer. Upon receipt of the sales orders, products are pulled from the shelves and moved to staging area at the loading docks. Daily as early as 2:00 AM, products are loaded into delivery vehicles from the staging area in preparation for delivery. Products are delivered to customers within 2 days of the order. Customer analysis can be generated through the information system and guides the sales person to follow up with customers for product promotion and post-sales services.

We offer a refund policy for non-satisfaction without penalty, which many of our small competitors in the market segment are unable to provide. We provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee to our customer. When a shipment is made and the products are not to the standards of the customer, we allow our customers to reject the order in whole or in part with no penalty within 24 hours. The non-penalty refund policy is designed to help us earn the trust and loyalty of our customers.
 
Inventory Procurement
 
We implemented a centralized inventory procurement under the lead of Zhou Min Ni, our CEO, and other experienced managers. All the inventory procurement of all the distribution centers are summarized and sent to the procurement team in in Greensboro, North Carolina. Centralized procurement allows us to have negotiating power with its suppliers and to control procurement costs.
 
We maintain a large supplier network through a vendor pool with a carefully selection of suppliers to ensure the product quality, availability and competitive pricing. Eighty percent of sales volume currently consists of domestic goods such as frozen meat and vegetables, which are procured through large suppliers or directly from the producer. The remaining twenty percent are imported specialty products. The procurement team directly manages our major vendors for large and frequent purchases and engages brokers for our smaller suppliers of specialty goods. Utilizing brokers allows us to maintain lower costs due to the brokers’ volume.
 
The key procurement team members closely monitor the supply market for seasonal products such as vegetables and make procurement adjustments according to market conditions. In addition, they use dual-sourcing method for their suppliers and can negotiate lower prices for comparable products. For high volume sale products such as certain vegetables and meats, we usually negotiates long term agreements with its suppliers to ensure stabile pricing and minimize risk due to market fluctuation.
 
Each distribution center reviews the inventory level in the information system on daily basis and submits purchase requests as needed to the procurement team at the headquarters. The procurement team in the headquarters also can make decisions based on an analysis of the inventory data in the system. Upon completion of the procurement of the products, the delivery schedule is based on the needs of each location. The lead-time for products is dependent on the product category and need. For perishable goods, products are usually delivered by suppliers within 72 hours of placing the order. Products that are ordered through import brokers have lead times of up to 7 days.
 
We employ a large supplier network to ensure product availability and low pricing. These suppliers range from small importers of specialty goods to large produce and meat suppliers. JBS USA LLC accounted for approximately 13.2% of our aggregate purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017. None of our suppliers accounted for more than 10% of our aggregate purchases during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
Warehousing
 
We use our information system for warehouse management with daily inventory monitoring. The system allows us to manage our inventory in an efficient way. It optimizes the inventory level and turnover, reducing waste, and helps to reduce labor costs to track and record the inventory.
 
Inventory levels are maintained based on the category of products. Perishable goods are kept at seven days levels. This includes produce and frozen goods. Non-perishable goods are held in greater quantities of inventory based on the pricing of the market. Non-perishable items are carefully monitored for pricing changes. As they have extended shelf life, there is an advantage to ordering larger quantities of stock. The inventory will, generally, turnover in just over three weeks, which we believe is average for distributors of similar size. Maintaining this level of inventory allows us to manage surges in demand.

Products are stored throughout warehouses in our distribution centers. A routine inventory count is taken weekly to ensure stock quantity and replenishment needs. Forty percent of the inventory consists of fresh meats and produce; this inventory is counted daily and turns over on average in about ten days. The other sixty percent consists of frozen and dry goods which are physically inventoried annually with top 50 items in volume with interim cycle counts every two weeks and average turnover of about 30 days. Perishable items are stored in freezers for a period of 7 to 15 days, depending on the shelf life. Non-perishable items are stored on racks until shelf life is reached or product is sold, whichever comes first. Products are broken down from their pallets and sold in their original packaging. Items stored in the warehouse are not removed from their original packaging. Each package is sold as one unit and priced accordingly.
 
Locations 
 
We currently have three distribution centers located in Greensboro, North Carolina, Ocala, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, with a total of 400,000 square feet of storage, including refrigerated storage of 95,000 square feet. The distribution centers are located on the route of many of our suppliers; delivery of each truckload can be made to each location with one large order. Each warehouse is equipped with multiple loading docks, allowing parallel methods of loading goods to the trucks during the start of each shift. Warehouse locations are also located in industrial regions, allowing large delivery trucks to enter without the need of acquiring permits.
 
It is important for us to strategically place our warehouses within certain markets to maximize our market capture. We currently strategically place our warehouses within markets that are not saturated and have limited competitors. This allows us to quickly penetrate the market and develop customer relationships that will assist in promotion of products and services. Upon penetrating the market, we will establish our warehouse into the regions to streamline our distribution network. This strategy is designed to improve the delivery routes and maximize the utilization of our delivery vehicles.
 
The table below summarizes the details of the three distribution centers:
 

Location | Total Size (Square Feet) | | Size of Refrigerated Storage (Square Feet) | | Year Established | Number of Truck 
---------------+--------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------------------------+---------+---------------------+-------------------
Greensboro, NC | | 170,000 | | 45,000 | | 2002 | 50 
Ocala, FL | | 130,000 | | 30,000 | | 2008 | 35 
Atlanta, GA | | 100,000 | | 25,000 | | 2006 | 20 
Total: | | 400,000 | | 100,000 | | | 105

Fleet Management
 
We currently own a fleet of 105 refrigerated vehicles. Each vehicle is 24 feet long and has a 12,000 pound capacity. All vehicles are identical in make and model. This is essential, as the fleet can be maintained by a single set of mechanics and suppliers for commonality. These vehicles are maintained by an in-house mechanic and follow a strict maintenance schedule. Each vehicle has a 7-year life cycle of approximately 250,000 miles. Each vehicle is refueled daily upon return from their delivery route. As delivery vehicles reach their usable life, they will be retired and replaced with larger vehicles that are 30 feet long and have a capacity of 36,000 pounds. This change in vehicle is dictated by our expected growth. We also operate a fleet of 12 tractors and 17 trailers for long-haul operations.
Promotion and Marketing 
 
We don’t advertise in the media or magazines. We have found that it is more efficient to telemarket and have drivers promote our business while executing deliveries. Our drivers visit the Chinese/Asian restaurants along their delivery route and are trained to market our products to non-customers along their route. Telemarketing is conducted by sales persons from the outsourced call center in China.

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths that differentiate us from competitors in the niche industry sector of food service distribution to Chinese restaurants:
 
A Large Array of Products to Meet the Demands of Customers. We offer over 1,000 products ranging from meats, vegetables and specialty products to packaging materials. Compared with the mainstream foodservice distributors in the United States, our products are selected to meet the demand of Chinese restaurants. A large array of products allows Chinese restaurants to purchase from us almost all of the products they need for operation, and receive one-stop service, which can help them run their business more efficiently with limited operation resources.
Cultural Understanding and Language Advantages. The majority of Chinese restaurants are owned and operated by Fuzhounese. By offering customers service in their native language, the sales persons can communicate smoothly and efficiently with our customers and understand what the customers need. With cultural understanding and a common language, sales people can design a product portfolio for our customers and use a precision marketing strategy to promote the Group’s products. The location of the outsourced call center controls costs by employing skilled salespersons at lower wages in China as compared with the U.S.
Outsourced Customer Call Center with Low Costs. We use an outsourced call center in China to manage our sales order, customer development, sales promotion, and post-sales services. The outsourced call center is located in Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province of China, with local employees speaking Mandarin, Fuzhou dialect and English. In addition to the advantage provided by interacting with customers in their native language, the location of the outsourced call center also helps us control costs by employing skilled sales persons at lower wages in China as compared with the U.S.
Cost Efficiency with Economies of Scale. We have developed our business around our three distribution centers serving over 3,200 Chinese restaurants in ten states in the southeastern United States. We believe we are the only Asian/Chinese food service distributor with a well-developed logistic infrastructure and experienced management team in the regions covered by our distribution network. Compared with small and local distributors, we operate in a more cost-efficient manner and have generated economies of scale, which allows us to offer products with competitive prices to our customers.
Strong Negotiation Power with Vendors. With a large purchase volume and a centralized procurement management, we have strong negotiating power with our vendors and are able to source high quality products at lower prices than many competitors. Our inventory procurement team is led by Mr. Zhou Min Ni, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, who has 20 years of operational experience in the industry. With a developed inventory procurement system supported by strong negotiating power and an experienced management team, we can offer our customers high quality products at competitive prices.
Developed Logistics Infrastructure. We have developed a sophisticated infrastructure with three distribution centers with a total storage capacity of 400,000 square feet and a fleet of 105 refrigerated vehicles, 12 tractors and 17 trailers. Our distribution network covers ten states in the southeastern United States, including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi. In conjunction with the development of our logistics infrastructure and business expansion, we have also developed our proprietary information system to manage our customer relationships and inventory. The logistics infrastructure provides efficiency and economies of scale resulting in significant advantages for us and creates a high entry barrier for potential competitors.
Proprietary Information System. We have developed a proprietary electronic information system for our customer relationship and inventory management. All customer information including preferences, purchase and payment history is recorded in the system and can be used to provide post-sales services and promotion. We use our system to daily monitor our inventory, which provides prompt management of inventory and important information to make operating decisions. The use of the electronic information system improves our management efficiency and reduces operating costs and makes us more competitive in the industry.
Experienced Management and Proven Growth. Key management personnel include Mr. Zhou Min Ni, Chief Executive Officer and his wife Chan Sin Wong, President, who founded the business and have grown it into a regional leader serving over 3,200 Chinese restaurants in ten states in the southeastern United States over the past 20 years. We have also built a team with operational experience, financial expertise and IT knowledge to grow the business. We believe that we are well-positioned to expand our business into other underserved regions through consolidation of small competitors.

Competition
 
The foodservice distribution industry is large and highly competitive. There are a few very large distributors serving the mainstream market. However, with natural cultural barriers, the mainstream foodservice distributors haven’t yet earned a significant market share for Chinese restaurants. Management believes that the market participants in the niche market segment that we are serving is highly fragmented and immature. With the continuing growth of demand for Chinese cuisine, we believe that this industry sector has significant opportunity for consolidation.
 
The competitors serving the industry sector for Chinese restaurants include a large number of small wholesalers, some medium-sized distributors, as well as large mainstream market players. However, we believe there is no dominating market player in this segment. Our customers also make purchase from local farms, retailers and grocery stores. Small wholesalers usually supply specialized items such as spices, specialized sauces, and specialty foods, which may also be carried in our product lists, but are not able offer the broadline products that we do. Compared with the medium-sized distributors and large mainstream market players, we have advantages of offering a relatively broad line of products, efficient operation infrastructure, and cultural understanding to maintain our market position and continue to grow our business.
 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We own three Trademarks: US Trademark 4,422,688, Han Feng, Inc., US Trademark 4,381,017, Han Feng, Inc., and common law trademark used for Han Feng.
 
Insurance
 
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide coverage for potential liability for worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability, product liability, director and officer’s liability, employee health care benefits and other casualty and property risks. Changes in legal trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency or insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all affect ultimate settlements of claims. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure it maintains adequate levels of coverage.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a workforce of approximately 400 persons, including both our employees and workers engaged through agency placements, 350 of whom are full-time associates and the remaining 50 of whom work part-time. We have 80 employees who have worked for us for 10 years or more. Our workforce is not unionized nor, to our knowledge, are there any plans for them to unionize. We have never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage. We regard our employee relations to be good.
Government Regulation
 
Legal compliance is important to our operations. We are required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the numerous jurisdictions in which we do business.
 
As a marketer and distributor of food products in the United States, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption.
 
 11



The recently published and pending rules under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) will significantly expand food safety requirements, including those of the Company. Among other things, FDA regulations implementing the FSMA require us to establish and maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated. The FSMA further imposes new requirements for food products imported into the U.S. and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority.
