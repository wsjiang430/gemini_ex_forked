Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a dedicated contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) that provides a comprehensive range of services from process development to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMP”) commercial manufacturing focused on biopharmaceutical products derived from mammalian cell culture. With over 25 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins in batch, fed-batch and perfusion modes, our services include CGMP clinical and commercial product manufacturing, purification, bulk packaging, stability testing and regulatory submissions and support. We also provide a variety of process development services, including cell line development and optimization, cell culture and feed optimization, analytical methods development and product characterization.
 
We have experience in performing process development and manufacturing of biologics since 1993 in our Franklin biomanufacturing facility (“Franklin Facility”) located at our headquarters in Tustin, California. In March 2016, we expanded our manufacturing capacity through the commissioning of one-half of our 84,000 square foot Myford biomanufacturing facility (“Myford Facility”), our second biomanufacturing facility, which includes multiple single-use bioreactors up to the 2,000-liter manufacturing scale. The Myford Facility was designed to accommodate a fully disposable biomanufacturing process for products in clinical development to commercial. The Myford Facility is located adjacent to our Franklin Facility.
 
Business Transition
 
During fiscal year 2018, we announced our intent to cease our research and development activities and to transition our business to a dedicated CDMO, which we completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. As part of our transition efforts during fiscal year 2018, we instituted a number of strategic actions designed to reduce costs and better position ourselves as a dedicated CDMO, including the following: (i) we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our corporate name to Avid Bioservices, Inc. and we adopted the new ticker symbol “CDMO” on The NASDAQ Capital Market to align with the new end-market focus and strategic positioning of our business; (ii) we classified our r84 technology as held for sale, which we subsequently sold in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to an Asset Assignment and Purchase Agreement (as described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and abandoned our remaining research and development assets; (iii) we sold our phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeting program pursuant to an Asset Assignment and Purchase Agreement (as described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements); and (iv) we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, pursuant to which we sold 10,294,445 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $2.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $23.2 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering related expenses of $1.7 million.
Business Strategy
 
Following the completion of our business transition to a dedicated CDMO, we established and began executing on the following near-term strategic objectives:



· | Expand existing customer relationships and diversify our customer base by securing additional customers to support our potential future revenue growth beyond fiscal year 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to invest in manufacturing facilities and infrastructure to maximize our facility utilization and support our customers’ development and clinical and commercial manufacturing requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Broaden our sales force by hiring sales representatives to execute our business development initiatives in key markets.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we are well positioned to address the market for outsourced development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals derived from mammalian cell culture due to the following factors:

· | Expertise in Mammalian Cell Culture Manufacturing: We believe that consolidation in the CDMO industry over the past several years has resulted in a limited number of nimble, independent CDMOs with mammalian cell culture-based biologics development and manufacturing capabilities. The mammalian cell culture production method is highly suitable for manufacturing complex molecules and we believe the benefits of the mammalian cell culture production method have played a significant role in accelerating the proliferation of biologics therapies. We believe we are well positioned in the industry given our expertise in mammalian cell culture for biologics manufacturing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Broad Spectrum of Services to Support Customers from Early Stage Development to Commercial: We provide fully integrated and customized biomanufacturing services that support our clients from the early preclinical stage to commercial launch and supply. We believe pharmaceutical companies generally prefer to engage with CDMOs that are able to work with a product throughout its lifecycle and have long-standing track records of regulatory compliance and quality control. Our Process Development, CGMP Biomanufacturing, Project Management, Quality Systems and Quality Control are all supported by modern facilities designed to meet customer needs from early stage development to commercial supply. We differentiate our capabilities through several key criteria: (i) we employ a customer-centric approach and collaborate with our clients to tailor customized development and manufacturing services; (ii) our agile manufacturing and development capabilities allow for rapid responses to shifting production requirements, leading to strong client satisfaction and retention; and (iii) our single-use bioreactors contributes to enhanced manufacturing efficiency for our customers and reduces our capital spending needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Regulatory Track Record: Historically, developing the expertise to comply with stringent regulatory audits and validation requirements has been a challenge for both pharmaceutical companies and CDMOs, and has been as a significant barrier to entry for many CDMOs, as facilities can take years to construct and properly validate. We believe pharmaceutical companies place a premium on working with CDMOs that can ensure a high degree of regulatory compliance, which decreases execution risk. We have a strong regulatory track record consisting of a 16-year inspection history with no significant impact on our business. In addition, between 2005 and 2017, we completed six successful pre-approval inspections. We also completed four U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) inspections between 2013 and the most recently completed inspection in early calendar year 2018, none of which resulted in any Form 483 observations by the FDA. Further, we have successfully complied with audits from large pharmaceutical companies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modern and Optimized Infrastructure: As a result of the development of our Myford Facility, we have positioned our business to capitalize on increasing demand in the biologics manufacturing industry for modular cleanroom space and single-use bioreactors. These developments have driven demand among pharmaceutical companies for facilities that can match bioreactor size to smaller volume production runs. With single-use bioreactors from 200 to 2,000 liters, our Myford Facility is designed to provide our customers with the desired efficiency and flexibility.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Significant Manufacturing Experience with a Proven Track Record: We have 26 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, over 14 years of CGMP commercial manufacturing experience and over 11 years of experience with single-use bioreactor technology. Our management team and board of directors have a deep understanding of the CDMO industry and have contributed their collective expertise to our recent transition to a dedicated CDMO.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we have a significant opportunity to drive organic growth by leveraging our strengths, broadening our capabilities, increasing our capacity and improving our market visibility. Further, our transition to a dedicated CDMO has allowed us to re-allocate resources previously utilized for our research and development activities and focus on the growth of our CDMO business.

· | Diversify Customer Base. We have taken and continue to take steps to diversify and expand our customer base and have developed marketing and sales strategies designed to drive new client acquisitions, while also continuing to leverage our existing relationships to pursue additional collaborations with our existing customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand Process Development Capabilities. We also continue to expand our process development capabilities in order to make our operations more attractive to emerging, mid-sized and large pharmaceutical companies. We are currently in the process of expanding and optimizing our process development capabilities and laboratory space, which includes expanding our total available process development laboratory space to more than 6,000 square feet, upgrading the infrastructure and equipment within our existing process development laboratories and implementing new state-of-the-art technologies and equipment designed to facilitate efficient, high-throughput development of innovative upstream and downstream manufacturing processes. We are strategically conducting this work in phases to avoid disruption to current customer programs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand Manufacturing Footprint and Enhance Efficiencies. We lease an additional 42,000 square feet of vacant warehouse space within the same building as our existing Myford Facility, which will allow us to utilize existing manufacturing and quality infrastructure that we believe should enhance our manufacturing efficiencies and reduce the overall cost and timeframe to construct a third biomanufacturing facility. This space could house a facility that can accommodate up to six additional 2,000-liter bioreactors. However, we currently do not expect to commence construction of the new facility until the manufacturing capacity at our existing facilities is close to full utilization or we determine that we require additional capacity to meet specific customer demand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase Operating Margins. We believe we have the opportunity to drive operating margin expansion by increasing manufacturing throughput, filling our available capacity, process efficiencies and continued process improvements. We believe increased facility capacity utilization resulting from the growth strategies described herein will permit us to generate more favorable operating margins. We expect to improve operating margins through investment in our facilities, people, process and technology. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reinvest in Equipment and Facilities. We believe that re-investing in our laboratory and manufacturing equipment and facilities is strategically important to meet future customer demand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
We manufacture CGMP pharmaceutical-grade products for our customers. The process for manufacturing generally uses commercially available raw materials from multiple suppliers, and in some instances, from a single source supplier. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We rely on third parties to supply most of the necessary raw materials and supplies for the products we manufacture on behalf of our customers and our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition” for additional discussion of raw materials supplied by third party vendors for the products we manufacture for our customers.
Regulatory Matters
 
We have a strong and proven regulatory track record, including 16 years of inspection history with no significant impact to our business. To date, we have been successfully audited and qualified by large and small and domestic and foreign biotechnology companies interested in the production of biologic material for clinical and commercial use. Additionally, we have been audited by several regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (“ANVISA”), the Canadian Health Authority (“Health Canada”), the California Department of Health and the Australian Department of Health.
 
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with CGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions, such as the EMA, ANVISA, Health Canada, and the Australian Department of Health. We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed in “Environmental and Safety Matters” below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers' products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization.
 
Our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with CGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. If new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations.

Environmental and Safety Matters
 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 
Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently own any patents and do not have any patent applications pending in the United States or any foreign countries. However, we have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise (“know-how”) and trade secrets in the provision of process development and manufacturing services. Our know-how and trade secrets may not be patentable, but they are valuable in that they enhance our ability to provide high-quality services to our customers. We typically place restrictions in our agreements with third-parties, which contractually restrict their right to use and disclose any of our proprietary technology with which they may be involved. In addition, we have internal non-disclosure safeguards, including confidentiality agreements, with our employees.
 
We also own trademarks to protect the names of our services. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.
 
Segment Information
 
Our business had historically been organized into two reportable operating segments: (i) our contract manufacturing services segment and (ii) our former research and development segment. However, as a result of the aforementioned strategic shift in our corporate direction to focus solely on our CDMO business, which resulted in the discontinuation of our research and development segment (as described in Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), management has determined that we operate in one operating segment with one reporting segment. Accordingly, the operating results of our former research and development segment and the related assets and liabilities have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. In addition, we had no foreign-based operations and no long-lived assets located in foreign countries as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Customers
 
Revenues have historically been derived from a small customer base. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we derived approximately 64%, 86% and 98% of our revenues from the top three customers, respectively. While we have been able to expand and diversify our customer base since we became a dedicated CDMO in January 2018, we continue to be dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenue. In addition, the duration of our fulfillment of customer contracts varies from a few months to more than 24 months due to the nature and size of each customer’s requirements. The loss of, or a significant reduction of business from, any of our primary customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding our customer concentration, including the name of significant customers, and geographic location of customers.

Backlog
 
Our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future contract manufacturing revenue from work not yet completed under signed contracts. As of April 30, 2019, our backlog was approximately $46 million as compared to approximately $48 million as of April 30, 2018. While we anticipate the majority of our backlog will be recognized during fiscal year 2020, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk that a customer timely cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of manufacturing services, in which case we may be required to refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; the risk that a customer may experience delays in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated manufacturing services; and the risk that we may not successfully execute on all customer projects, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenue.
Competition
 
Our competition in the CDMO market includes a number of full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Also, large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Employees
 
As of April 30, 2019, we employed 211 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
Company Information
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of California in June 1981 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware on September 25, 1996. Our principal executive offices are located at 2642 Michelle Drive, Suite 200, Tustin, California, 92780 and our telephone number is (714) 508-6100. Our principal website address is www.avidbio.com.
