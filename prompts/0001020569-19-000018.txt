Business Overview
We help organizations around the world protect their information, reduce storage rental costs, comply with regulations, facilitate corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information and IT infrastructure for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or life cycle stage. We do this by storing physical records and data backup media, offering information management solutions, and providing enterprise-class colocation and wholesale data center space. We offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, legal and regulatory compliance, and disaster recovery requirements.

Business Strategy
Overview
Our company has been a market leader in the physical ecosystem around information storage and retrieval, as most businesses have relied on paper documents or computer tapes to store their valuable information. Over time, customers are increasing their digital information, with the new information storage ecosystem being a hybrid of physical and digital mediums. We offer a suite of "mission-critical" storage and related services to help customers with this transformation, and utilize the strategy outlined below to grow our business. 

• | Driving Growth and Margins in Records and Information Management in Developed Markets - We are focused on increasing revenues in developed markets such as the United States, Canada, western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, primarily through more targeted sales and marketing efforts to support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs to us, as well as gaining incremental volumes from existing customers and successful revenue management. We expect to continue to pursue attractive acquisitions, designed to optimize the utilization of our existing assets, expand our presence and better serve our customers, as well as invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. In our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will continue to generate margin expansion opportunities.


• | Expansion of Records and Information Management in Emerging Markets - Part of our strategy is to establish and enhance leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia (excluding Australia and New Zealand, ("Emerging Markets")), primarily through acquisitions. In our existing Emerging Markets locations, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses achieve scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of the cash flows generated to support the growth of these businesses.


• | Investing in Faster-Growing Businesses - We continue to identify, acquire, incubate and scale complementary Adjacent Businesses ("ABs") to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. The opportunities complementary to our business include entertainment, fine art and consumer storage and related services.

• | Continued Expansion of Data Center Business - We have made significant progress through acquisitions and organic growth in scaling our data center business, which began as an AB but has now grown to such a size that we no longer consider it an AB. As of December 31, 2018, 91.4% of our capacity is leased, with total potential capacity of 324.9 megawatts.

Our strategy is underpinned by our persistent focus on customer experience, as we continue to seek innovative solutions to help our customers navigate the journey from physical storage to a digital ecosystem.
Business Segments 
The amount of revenues derived from our business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

• | North American Records and Information Management Business: Our North American Records and Information Management Business segment includes three distinct offerings. First, we provide records and information management storage and related services, including the storage of physical records, including media such as microfilm and microfiche, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for customers (“Records Management”) throughout the United States and Canada.

Second, this segment includes certain services related to Records Management, including secure shredding operations, which typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. Secure shredding, which involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us, is a natural extension of our hard copy records management operations and completes the lifecycle of a record. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the United States and Canada.
The third offering, Information Governance and Digital Solutions ("IGDS"), develops, implements and supports comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information, including the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage in the United States and Canada.

• | North American Data Management Business: Our North American Data Management Business segment provides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations (“Data Protection & Recovery”); server and computer backup services; and related services offerings, including our Iron Mountain Iron Cloud solution, (collectively, "Data Management").


• | Western European Business: Our Western European Business segment provides Records Management, Data Management and IGDS throughout Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.


• | Other International Business: Our Other International Business segment provides Records Management, Data Management and IGDS throughout the remaining European countries in which we operate, as well as the countries in which we operate in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.


• | Global Data Center Business: Our Global Data Center Business segment provides enterprise-class data center facilities to protect mission-critical assets and ensure the continued operation of our customers’ IT infrastructure, with secure and reliable colocation and wholesale options. As of December 31, 2018, we had data center operations in eight markets in the United States: Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Missouri; Boston, Massachusetts; Boyers, Pennsylvania; Manassas, Virginia; Edison, New Jersey; Columbus, Ohio; and Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona and three international markets: Amsterdam, London, and Singapore.

• | Corporate and Other Business: Our Corporate and Other Business segment primarily consists of the storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types and digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients (“Entertainment Services”), throughout the United States, Canada, France, China - Hong Kong S.A.R., the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and our fine art storage businesses and consumer storage businesses in the United States, Canada, Europe and China - Hong Kong S.A.R. These businesses represent the primary offerings of our Adjacent Businesses operating segment. Additionally, our Corporate and Other Business segment includes costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and IT, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. Our Corporate and Other Business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan.

Business Attributes
Our business has the following attributes:

• | Large, Diversified, Global Business - Our mission-critical storage offerings and related services generated more than $4.2 billion in annual revenue in 2018. Our business has a highly diverse customer base of approximately 225,000 customers - with no single customer accounting for more than 1% of revenue - and operates in approximately 50 countries globally.


• | Recurring, Durable Revenue Stream - We generate a majority of our revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly storage rental fees, via contracts that generally range from one-five years in length. Historically, we have seen strong customer retention (of approximately 98%) and solid physical records retention; more than 50% of physical records that entered our facilities 15 years ago, are still with us today.


• | Significant Owner and Operator of Real Estate - We operate approximately 90 million square feet of real estate in over 1,400 facilities worldwide. Our owned real estate footprint spans nearly 30 million square feet and is concentrated in major metropolitan statistical areas in North America, Western Europe and Latin America.


• | Limited Revenue Cyclicality - Historically, economic downturns have not significantly affected our storage rental business. Due to the stability in our total global physical records volumes, the success of our revenue management, and the growth of our data center business, we believe we can continue to grow storage rental revenue over time.


• | Shifting Revenue Mix - Our growth portfolio, which consists of our business in Emerging Markets, our data center business, and our Adjacent Businesses, comprised 19% of our total revenue in 2018, and grew 7% year over year, on an internal basis. We expect our growth portfolio to comprise an increasingly larger percentage of our overall business in the coming years.

Significant Acquisitions
With the rapid acceleration of growth in digital data and use of cloud storage, highly regulated companies and public sector organizations are selecting third-party providers such as us to host their data center infrastructure. We have been providing customers with colocation and wholesale data center space and solutions for more than 15 years, and have significantly expanded our data center business in the last few years with acquisitions, the most significant one being that of IO Data Centers, LLC (“IODC”).
On January 10, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the United States operations of IODC, a leading data center colocation space and solutions provider based in Phoenix, Arizona, for approximately $1.34 billion (the "IODC Transaction"). See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. The purchase included the land and buildings associated with four state-of-the-art data centers in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona, Edison, New Jersey, and Columbus, Ohio. This acquisition marked a transformative step toward addressing our customers’ data center needs by dramatically expanding our platform and capabilities. With the build-out of our existing footprint and the additional capacity from IODC and other recent acquisitions, our data center portfolio as of December 31, 2018 totals more than 100 megawatts of existing capacity, with an additional 11 megawatts of capacity currently under construction and planned and future expansion potential of another 211 megawatts.

We have completed many acquisitions over the years to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden our offerings. While most of these acquisitions have been smaller in size given the fragmented nature of the records management industry, our acquisition of Recall in 2016 was another significant transaction. On May 2, 2016 we purchased Recall, a multi-national records and information management company, for approximately $2.2 billion, comprised of $331.8 million in cash and approximately 50.2 million shares of our common stock.
Competition 
We compete with storage and information management services managed and operated internally by organizations and thousands of storage and information management services providers around the world. We believe that competition for records and information customers is based on price, reputation and reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in these areas.
We also compete with numerous data center developers, owners and operators, many of whom own properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our facilities are located. We believe that competition for data center customers is based on availability of power, security considerations, location, connectivity and rental rates, and we generally believe we compete effectively in each of these areas. Additionally, we believe our strong brand, global footprint and excellent commercial relationships enable us to compete successfully.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed more than 9,000 employees in the United States and more than 17,200 employees outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 500 employees in California, Georgia and New Jersey and three provinces in Canada were represented by unions in North America and approximately 1,400 employees were represented by unions in Latin America (in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico).
All union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Certain unionized employees in California receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. All union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement.
Insurance and Contractual Limitations on Liability
For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies.

Our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability for damages regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, and other information and valuable items stored with us. Our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot, and our liability for data center, IGDS, destruction services and other services unrelated to records stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or higher limits. We can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. In the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. Moreover, as a larger percentage of our growth is driven by acquisitions and customer contracts assumed in acquisitions make up a commensurately larger percentage of our customer contracts, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. Although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes.
Environmental Matters
Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental cost and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.
We transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.
