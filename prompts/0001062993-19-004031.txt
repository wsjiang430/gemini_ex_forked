ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
Overview
             We are a leading provider of financial technology, or fintech, products and services to the unbanked and underbanked in a number of emerging and developed economies. In emerging economies these customers are typically individuals, while in developed countries, they are primarily small businesses. We have developed and own most of our payment technologies, and where possible, utilize this technology to provide financial and value-added services to our customers by including them into the formal financial system. 
             Our core payment technology is called the Universal Electronic Payment System, or UEPS, and its EMV interoperable derivative, UEPS/EMV, utilizes a form of distributed ledger technology, providing decentralized and biometrically secure smart cards that operate in real-time but both off-line and on-line, unlike traditional payment systems offered by major banking institutions that require immediate access through a communications network to a centralized computer.
             Our off-line UEPS system also offers the highest level of availability and affordability by removing any components that are costly and prone to outages. Our UEPS/EMV solution enables our traditional proprietary UEPS system to interoperate with the global EMV standard and allows card holders to transact at any EMV-enabled point of sale terminal or automated teller machine, or ATM. The UEPS/EMV technology has been deployed on an extensive scale in South Africa through the issuance of MasterCard-branded UEPS/EMV cards to our under-banked customers, including social welfare grant recipients. In addition to effecting purchases, cash-backs and any form of payment, our system can be used for banking, healthcare management, money transfers, voting and identification. 
             Our transaction processing services include multiple forms of payment processing. We operate leading merchant processors in South Africa through EasyPay and in South Korea through KSNET, a fixed and mobile ATM infrastructure in South Africa, as well as end-to-end issuing, acquiring and processing services across Asia and Europe through our International Payments Group, or IPG. We managed more than 300,000 merchants worldwide and processed more than three billion transactions in Fiscal 2019. With two decades of experience in cryptography and secure transactions, through IPG, we have established a leadership position in partnership with Bank Frick & Co. AG, or Bank Frick, a Liechtenstein-based bank, in Europe focused on cryptocurrency processing and the development of a number of block-chain related products such as our new crypto-asset storage product. 
             Our financial inclusion products and services are delivered through our UEPS-based core banking system, providing a low-cost, biometrically secure transactional bank account to our customers, and distributing a number of financial, telecom and other value-added products through this platform in order to garner a greater share of wallet. In South Africa, this system is currently deployed under the brand EasyPay Everywhere, or EPE, and at June 30, 2019, we have approximately 1.1 million active customers on the platform.
             Our technology businesses include the development and deployment of our UEPS and Mobile Virtual Card, or MVC, solutions worldwide, cryptographic solutions including the STS-6 standard for utility vending solutions, hardware security modules or HSM, chip and subscriber identity module, or SIM, cards, and the reselling of point of sale equipment.

 Market Opportunity
             Services for the under-banked: Dozens of national governments have adopted policies to expand financial inclusion to their citizens. According to the most recent World Banks 2017 Global Findex Database, 69% of adults worldwide have access to an account at a financial institution or through a mobile money service. In developing economies, this percentage is 63%. As a result, 1.7 billion adults around the world remain entirely excluded from the financial system. Globally, 20% of the banked population have inactive accounts, i.e. no transactions for twelve months, taking the market opportunity to well over 2 billion adults. This situation arises when banking fees are either too high relative to an individuals income, a bank account provides little or no meaningful benefit or there is insufficient infrastructure to provide financial services economically in the individuals geographic location. We refer to these people as the unbanked and the under-banked. These individuals typically receive wages, welfare benefits, money transfers or loans in the form of cash, and conduct commercial transactions, including the purchase of food and clothing, also in cash. 
 
            Our target under-banked customer base in most emerging economies, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, has limited access to formal financial services and therefore relies heavily on the unregulated informal sector for such services. The power of financial technology to expand access to, and use of accounts is particularly relevant in sub-Saharan Africa, where 21% of adults have a mobile money account. Globally, the share of adults who borrow from formal sources, has remained flat between 2014 and 2017 at 23%, which implies that half of the borrowers globally rely on informal lenders resulting in exorbitant borrowing costs, questionable recovery practices and the inevitable downward debt spiral. By leveraging our smart card and mobile technologies, we are able to offer affordable, secure and reliable financial services such as transacting accounts, loans and insurance products to these consumers and alleviate some of the challenges they face in dealing with the informal sector, while also allowing them to build a credit history and gain access to the broader formal financial services industry.
             Over the past two decades we have issued millions of cards across more than ten developing countries, and therefore our track record and scale uniquely position us to continue further geographical penetration of our technology in additional emerging countries. 
             Similarly, in developed countries, Small and Micro Enterprises, or SMEs, frequently fall into the underbanked category due to cumbersome and costly efforts to secure banking relationships, payment processing and credit. According to a Deloitte report, titled Digital banking for small and medium-sized enterprises Improving access to finance for the underserved, on Digital Banking for Small Businesses, several factors drive low financial inclusion of SMEs, including 1) limited financial infrastructure such as poor coverage by credit bureaus limit availability and cost of securing credit; 2) inadequate distribution channels limit banks from reaching and servicing SMEs in either the physical or digital space; 3) lack of cash-flow visibility forces banks to adopt stringent collateral-based credit risk models which hinder lending to SMEs without collateral; and 4) regulations and compliance costs adversely impact banks from serving small customers and invariably drive up costs. 
 3

            These inefficiencies have created an opportunity for neo-or-challenger banks and fintech companies to improve reach and coverage for SMEs and accelerate access to, and reduce cost of banking and financial services. Our issuing, acquiring and platforms together with our e-money licenses and relationship with Bank Frick, a European bank in which we have a sizeable strategic investment, allows SMEs to open accounts and accept electronic payments almost instantly, letting them focus on running their core business. 
             Transaction processing services: The continued global growth of retail credit, debit and prepaid card transactions is reflected in the May 2019 Nilson Report, according to which worldwide annual general purpose card dollar volume increased 19.1% to $33.7 trillion in 2018, while transaction volume increased by 22.4% to 406.3 billion transactions and cards issued increased by 10.4% to 13.2 billion cards during the same period. General purpose cards include the major card network brands such as MasterCard, Visa, UnionPay and American Express. In South Africa, we operate the largest bank-independent transaction processing service through EasyPay, where we have developed a suite of value-added services such as bill payment, airtime top-up, gift card, money transfer and prepaid utility purchases that we offer as a complete solution to merchants and retailers. In South Korea, through KSNET, we are one of the largest Value-added network, or VAN, processors, and we provide card processing, banking value-added services and payment gateway functionality to more than 223,000 retailers. IPG operates as an established end-to-end provider of issuing, acquiring, and processing, particularly for small merchants or those with significant cross-border operations. Another key differentiator of IPG is its extensive catalog of licenses and regulated entities, including some within the fast-growing fields of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. IPG is ably supported by Bank Frick. 
             Mobile payments: The rapid growth of online commerce and the emergence of mobile devices as the preferred access channel for transacting online has created a global opportunity for the provision of secure payment services to online retailers and service providers. Our MVC technology focuses on card-not-present transactions and enables interoperability between closed or semi-closed networks, and has been deployed in South Africa, India and the United States. Additionally, through ZappGroup Africa, one of our strategic investments, we are able to provide QR technology to emerging countries in Africa, allowing them leapfrog the 50+ year old card technology and go straight to mobile, as many countries like China, India, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya have done. 
             Despite lacking access to formal financial services, large proportions of the under-banked customer segment own and utilize mobile phones. The World Banks research has confirmed the rising popularity of using mobile phones to transfer money and for banking that often does not require setting up an account at a brick-and-mortar bank. The World Bank has stated that mobile banking, which allows account holders to pay bills, make deposits or conduct other transactions via text messaging, has rapidly expanded in Sub-Saharan Africa, where traditional banking has been hampered by transportation and other infrastructure problems. The 2017 Global Findex Database: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution states that 21% of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile-money account  nearly twice the percentage compared to 2014. In developing economies, 19% of adults reported making at least one direct payment using a mobile money account, a mobile phone, or the internet.
             Mobile phones are therefore increasingly viewed as a channel through which this underserved population can gain access to formal financial and other services. Our UEPS, MVC and QR code solutions are enabled to run on the SIM cards in or as applications on mobile phones and provide our users with secure payment and banking functionality. 
 Our Strategy
             Our core purpose is to improve peoples lives by bringing financial inclusion to the worlds under-banked customers and helping small businesses access the financial services they need to prosper. We achieve this through our unique ability to efficiently digitize or tokenize the expensive and difficult to achieve last mile of financial inclusion.
             Our strategy varies by geography and service, and accordingly our approach is based on four pillars which are supplemented by our strategic investments:
             South Africawe own or control most of the components of the vertical chain in South Africa, from core banking to lending and insurance to payments, processing and value-added services as well as a significant last mile distribution network. Our focus remains squarely on the underbanked population who are low-wage earners or those receiving welfare grants, as well as any customers accessing our payment infrastructure, ATMs and bill payment platforms. 
             Our EPE banking product provides our target market with an affordable all-inclusive transactional bank account with access to financially inclusive services such as microloans, life insurance, remittances, value added services such as prepaid utilities and bill payments through their mobile phones and our national network of ATMs and POS devices. At June 30, 2019, we had approximately 1.1 million active EPE customers. Going forward, we will also work more closely with Finbond Group Limited, or Finbond, a South African bank in which we have a significant strategic investment, to issue new and expanded banking and financial services offerings. Additionally, our combined branch, point-of-sale and ATM network with Finbond, would make us the second largest bank in South Africa from a distribution and coverage perspective. 
 4

            We are also one of the leading independent transaction processors, and have deployed the most extensive distribution network comprising of mobile and fixed ATMs and POS devices to the countrys large unbanked and under-banked population, we are the largest third-party processor of retail merchant transactions, bill payments and third-party payroll payments. We believe that our large cardholder base, specialized technology and payment infrastructure, together with our strong business relationships, position us at the epicenter of commerce in the country. Through our national distribution platform and relationships with a number of leading companies across multiple industries, we believe that we can provide many of the services consumed by our cardholders who would normally not have access to these services or would otherwise have to rely on the informal sector. We have a network of mobile ATMs to provide services to our cardholders, and we have established a national fixed ATM and POS network.
             We aim to increase the adoption of our existing services by expanding our cardholder base and our transacting network, and increase our service offerings by developing new products and distribution networks and by forging partnerships with industry participants who share our vision and can accelerate the implementation of our business plan. 
             AfricaDepending on the country, only 10% to 30% of the adult populations have access to financial services and thus the deployment of cloud-based bank-in-a-box and mobile-based solutions, together with strong local partners, remains a substantial opportunity for us. Today we are operational in nine African countries through our Virtual Top Up, or VTU, offerings in partnership with MTN, UEPS is deployed as the national payment system in Ghana and extensively used in Namibia and Botswana, a rapidly growing digital consumer finance business in Nigeria through OneFi, and our relatively new QR-based payment initiatives through ZappGroup Africa. We also intend to increase cooperation across our operations in various African countries to build a substantial continent-wide fintech platform that is home to a billion people. 
             Our mobile-first approach is predicated on the belief that mobile payments, mobile wallets and the related applications should be a critical component of a payment processors future strategy and we have dedicated a significant portion of our research and development and business development resources to ensure that we remain at the forefront of this rapidly evolving technological space. 
             Europe and Asia (ex-Korea)This opportunity is driven by IPG and focuses primarily on the SME market as well as solutions utilizing blockchain and cryptocurrencies. IPG was created by combining a number of regional assets and licenses to form a comprehensive international payments business providing issuing, acquiring and processing, supported by Bank Frick in Europe. IPG has developed new, state-of-the-art issuing and acquiring platforms that have now been certified by Visa and MasterCard. 
             In India, we own an interest in MobiKwik, one of the largest digital financial services platforms in India with over 80 million users. MobiKwik helps us gain entry to a large and complex market and we have already deployed our MVC technology, allowing their wallet to become interoperable and offering an effective disbursement tool for their loan products.
             South KoreaKSNET in Korea is one of the largest VANs in the country with 223,000 merchants and over 359,000 POS deployed. It processed in excess of 1.7 billion transactions in fiscal 2019. KSNET is also the only one of the large VANs that provides Card VAN, Banking VAN and payment gateway, or PG, services. Banking VAN and payment gateway markets are faster growing and are an area of focus for KSNET. We are introducing new products such as working capital finance to leverage their high-fixed cost infrastructure. 
Our Businesses
             Our company is organized into the following business lines:
             South African Banking and Financial Services
             We have developed a suite of financial services that is offered to customers utilizing our payment solutions. We are able to provide our UEPS/EMV cardholders with competitive transacting accounts, microfinance, life insurance and money transfer products based on our understanding of their risk profiles, demographics and lifestyle requirements. Our financial services offerings are designed on the principles of simplicity and cost-efficiency as they bring financial inclusion to our millions of cardholders who were previously unable to access any formal financial services in a convenient or cost-effective manner. Our banking product, EPE, provides our target market with an affordable all-inclusive transactional bank account with unfettered access to financial services such as microloans, life insurance, remittances, value added services such as prepaid utilities and bill payments through their mobile phones and our national network of ATMs and POS devices. 
 5

            Our largest financial services offering is the provision of short-term microloans to our South African UEPS/EMV cardholders, where we provide the loans using our surplus cash reserves and earn revenue from the service fees charged on these loans. We believe our loans are the most affordable form of credit available to our target market as, unlike our competitors, we do not charge interest or credit life insurance premiums on our loans. We also offer our customer base affordable insurance products relevant to this market segment, focusing on group life and funeral insurance policies.
             This business unit has been allocated to our South African transaction processing and financial inclusion and applied technologies reporting segments. 
                      EasyPay
             Our EasyPay business unit operates the largest bank-independent financial switch in South Africa and is based in Cape Town, South Africa. EasyPay focuses on the provision of high-volume, secure and convenient payment, prepayment and value-added services to the South African market. EasyPays infrastructure connects into all major South African banks and switches both debit and credit card EFT transactions for some of South Africas leading retailers and petroleum companies. It is a South African Reserve Bank, or SARB, approved third-party payment processor. In addition to its core transaction processing and switching operations, EasyPay provides a complete end-to-end reconciliation and settlement service to its customers. 
             This business unit has been allocated to our South African transaction processing reporting segment. 
                      KSNET
             Our KSNET business unit is based in Seoul, South Korea, and is a national payment solutions provider. KSNET has one of the broadest product offerings in the South Korean payment solutions market, a base of approximately 223,000 merchants and an extensive direct and indirect sales network. The merchant base is predominantly serviced via a network of independent agents. KSNETs core operations comprise three primary product offerings, namely card VAN, PG, and Banking VAN. KSNET is able to realize significant synergies across these core operations because it is the only payment solutions provider that offers all three of these offerings in South Korea. Approximately 78% of KSNETs revenue comes from the provision of payment processing services to merchants and card issuers through its card VAN. KSNET has also started providing working capital financing to those merchants where we provide payment processing services.
            This business unit has been allocated to our International transaction processing reporting segment. 
                      International Payments Group
             IPG is based out of Hong Kong, China, and is an end-to-end payment service provider. IPG includes our processing business based in Munich, Germany, and holds e-money licenses in the United Kingdom and in Europe, and provides debit and credit card acquiring in Europe, the UK, and Asia including China. Additionally, IPG provides Automated Clearing House, or ACH, processing in the United States, and card acquiring services for cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitstamp and Bitpanda.
             In collaboration with Bank Frick, IPG provides a number of banking and processing services to small merchants. Through a joint, collaborative approach, IPG and Bank Frick have established a blockchain development division to create new, first-to market differentiated solutions to harness the capabilities of a bank and a processor. 
             This business unit has been allocated to our International transaction processing reporting segment. 
                      Applied Technology
             Our Applied Technology business unit is managed from Johannesburg, South Africa, and is responsible for various individual lines of business:
 
Payment InfrastructureThe deployment of our South African
 ATM and POS network and the sale of biometric and POS solutions to various
 South African banks, retailers and financial services providers. Our
 biometrically-enabled ATM network is fully EMV-compliant and integrated into
 the South African national payment system. We deploy our ATMs in areas where
 our UEPS/EMV cardholders have limited access to the national payment system,
 or where the cost of accessing the national payment system through other
 service providers is prohibitive for our cardholders.
 Chip & SIMThrough our partnerships with MNOs as well as card
 and semiconductor manufacturers, we provide a strong lineup of feature rich
 chip and SIM solutions. All of these offerings include our wide range of GSM
 Masks and custom software that enables mobile telephony, transactions and
 on-chip VAS. We support the above chip and SIM developments with dedicated
 chip-card based commerce frameworks. These incorporate POS, terminal and
 interbank transaction switching and clearance aimed at national government,
 petroleum and retail industries. 
 6


CryptographyOur Cryptography business line focuses on
 security-orientated products which include our range of PIN encryption
 devices, card acceptance modules and hardware security modules. These focus on
 financial, retail, cryptocurrency, telecommunications, utilities and petroleum
 sectors. In order to constantly enhance and improve our product offerings,
 special attention is placed on the development of security initiatives
 including Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, also known as TDES, EMV and
 Payment Card Industry, or PCI. We are a member of the STS Association,
 actively participating in developing new and improved standards that address
 the needs of the modern cryptographic market. 
             This business unit has been allocated to our financial inclusion and applied technologies reporting segments. 
                      Corporate
             The Corporate unit provides global support services to our business units, joint ventures and investments for the following activities:
 
Group executiveResponsible for the overall company management,
 defining our global strategy, investor relations and corporate finance
 activities.
 Finance and administrationProvides company-wide support in the
 areas of accounting, treasury, human resources, administration, legal,
 secretarial, taxation, compliance and internal audit.
 Group information technologyDefines our overall IT strategy and
 the overall systems architecture and is responsible for the identification and
 management of the groups research and development activities.
 Joint ventures and investments unitProvides governance support to
 our joint ventures and assists with the evaluation of new investment
 opportunities. 
Competition
             In addition to competition that our UEPS system faces from the use of cash, checks, credit and debit cards, existing payment systems and the providers of financial services, there are a number of other products that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system. While it is impossible for us to estimate the total number of competitors in the global payments marketplace, we believe that the most competitive product in this marketplace is EMV, a system that is promoted by most of the major card companies such as Visa, MasterCard, JCB and American Express. The competitive advantage of our UEPS offering is that our technology can operate real-time, but in an off-line environment, using biometric identification instead of the standard PIN methodology employed by our competitors. We have enhanced our competitive advantage through the development of our latest version of the UEPS technology that has been certified by EMV, which facilitates our traditionally proprietary UEPS system to interoperate with the global EMV standard and allows card holders to transact at any EMV-enabled point of sale terminal or ATM. The UEPS/EMV technology has been deployed on an extensive scale in South Africa through the issuance of MasterCard-branded UEPS/EMV cards to our unbanked and underbanked cardholders.
             We further intend to differentiate our value proposition for our end users by offering bundled lifestyle products to include affordable telephony solutions in addition to banking and finance, as well as the development of new payment technologies specifically for mobile phones. We estimate that we process less than 1% of all global payment transactions in the international marketplace.
             In South Africa, and specifically in the payment of salaries and wages and our affordable EPE transactional account and our financial services offering, our competitors include the local traditional and digital banks, insurance companies, micro-lenders and other transaction processors. The South African banks and South African Post Office, or SAPO, also offer low cost bank accounts that enable account holders to receive their salaries, wages or social grants through the formal banking payment networks. 
             EasyPays competitors include BankservAfrica, UCS, eCentric and Transaction Junction. BankservAfrica is the largest transaction processor in South Africa, which processes all transactions on behalf of the South African banks and processes more than 2.5 billion transactions per annum.
             In the South African ATM network market, we compete against the South African banks, ATM Solutions and Spark ATM Systems, who collectively have a market share in excess of 90%. 
             We have identified 13 major card VAN companies in South Korea, of which KSNET is one of the largest. The other two large VAN companies are NICE Information & Telecommunication Inc. and Korea Information & Communications Company, Inc. Entities operating in the VAN industry in South Korea compete on pricing and customer service. 
 7

            IPG competitors typically include local or regional issuers, acquirers and processors as well as a few large multinational companies such as Wirecard and WorldPay. A number of new fintech entrants and neo-banks, usually locally or occasionally regionally such as Stripe, Revolut, N26, Klarna, Transferwise, and Digibank are also rapidly establishing their market presence.
             In addition to our traditional competitors, we expect that we will increasingly compete with a number of emerging entities in the mobile payments industry. While the industry is still rapidly evolving, a number of entities are establishing their presence in this space. Specifically identified entities include traditional payment networks such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express; commercial banks such as Barclays and Citigroup; established technology companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Samsung and PayPal; local and global fintech companies; as well as companies specifically focused on mobile payments such as Ant Financial, WeChat, M-Pesa and Square. 
 Intellectual Property 
             Our success depends in part on our ability to develop, maintain and protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We seek to protect new intellectual property developed by us by filing new patents worldwide. We hold a number of trademarks in various countries.
