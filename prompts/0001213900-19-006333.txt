ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Background
 
Ficaar, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in July 2001 in the State of Georgia under the name OwnerTel, Inc. The name of the Company was changed to Ficaar, Inc. in December of 2007. The Company operates its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, STANDARD CANNA, INC. (“Standard”), a Florida corporation formed in 2014, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, STANDARD CULTIVATION SYSTEMS INC., a Colorado corporation formed in 2014, and STANDARD PROPERTY GROUP INC., a California corporation formed in 2014; and PRECIOUS HOLDINGS, INC. formed in April of 2011 in the state of Delaware.
 
The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. 
 
In August 2012, certain shareholders of the Ficaar (the “Shareholders”), representing a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of Ficaar, entered into an agreement and consummated such agreement with Sneaker Charmz, Inc., a Delaware corporation, whereby 72,020,000 shares of common stock of Ficaar was assigned by the Shareholders to Sneaker Charmz. Thereafter, Sneaker Charmz, Ficaar and David Cicalese consummated a transaction where the shares of common stock of Ficaar owned by Sneaker Charmz were transferred and assigned to Mr. Cicalese and Mr. Cicalese transferred his ownership of Sneaker Charmz to Ficaar. Thus Sneaker Charmz became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ficaar and Mr. Cicalese owned85% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of Ficaar.
 
In January 2014, Mr. David Cicalese, President, a member of the Board of Directors and majority shareholder of Ficaar, contributed 100 shares of Precious Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which consists of all of the issued and outstanding equity of Precious Holdings, Inc. Thus Precious Holdings Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On November 16, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of STANDARD CANNA, INC. (“Standard”), a Florida corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, STANDARD CULTIVATION SYSTEMS INC., a Colorado corporation; and STANDARD PROPERTY GROUP INC., a California corporation, in exchange for 110,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to a Transfer Agreement (the “Agreement”), by and among, the Company and Jonas Zetzel, sole shareholder of Standard.
 
In addition, on July 28, 2015, the Company transferred its ownership in Sneaker Charmz, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to David Cicalese, our sole officer and director and majority shareholder in exchange for 42,000,000 shares of our common stock. Thus reducing Mr. Cicalese’s share ownership of the Company from 72,020,000 to 30,020,000 shares of our common stock.
 
The business of the Company, operating through its wholly owned subsidiary, Standard, is the purchase, development and operation of growing space and related facilities and leasing the facilities to marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations in jurisdictions where such operations are consistent with state and local law.
 
In July 2015, the Board of Directors and shareholders representing a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company appointed Dawn Cames as President of the Company and a member of its Board of Directors. In connection with Ms. Cames appointment, she was issued 1,300,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
 
Our stock currently is quoted on OTC Markets under the symbol “FCAA”.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act. We will be deemed a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured on January 1st .
 
We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
 
A Company that elects to be treated as an emerging growth company shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration statement; (iii) the date on which it has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’ as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon it attaining a public float of at least $700 million.
 
However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

Competition
 
We believe that the current market for properties that meet our investment objectives is extremely competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We compete with numerous other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, banks and insurance company investment accounts, other REITs, real estate limited partnerships, and other entities, to acquire, manage and sell real estate properties and real estate related assets. Many of our expected competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase.
Intellectual Property
 
On July 9, 2018, the Company submitted a trademark application under Serial Number 88029748 with respect to “STANDARD CANNA” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). The trademark application is still under examination by the USPTO and as of the date of filing, the trademark is not yet registered. Any encroachment upon the company’s proprietary information, including the unauthorized use of its brand name or trademarks, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated either by our Company or against our Company for infringement upon proprietary information or improper use of a trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on its business due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to infringement.  Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.  Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations.
Government Regulations
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law.   Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.   The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.”  If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana in those states whit it is legal under state law, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of this filing, 33 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana.  Additionally, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for recreational use by adults.  The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Trump administration has indicated that it is not in favor of the legalization of marijuana, and on January 4, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Obama-era Department of Justice guidance (the “Cole Memo”) that essentially kept the DOJ’s hands-off state-legal marijuana operators. 
 
The effect of the Sessions Memo is yet unclear, though this is will likely make it much more difficult for businesses in this sector to secure traditional funding, since FinCEN’s 2014 guidance heavily relied on the Cole Memo and DOJ banking memo, both of which are now rescinded. FinCEN could still reinforce its own guidance, but that’s going to be hard to do without these other memos in place. Many financial institutions will likely stop providing banking services to the cannabis industry. Additionally, it is likely that some investors and landlords will pull out of the industry as well for fear of asset forfeitures and secondary criminal liability.
 
This change (and any change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws) could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.  While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.

Licensing and Local Regulations
 
Where applicable, we will apply for state licenses or similar approvals that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws.
 
Local laws at the county and municipal level add an additional layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a state’s adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis, counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail, distribution, manufacturing or consumption.
 
Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum and may otherwise be restricted by state laws. For example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, discretionary approvals may be required for certain uses, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this registration, the Company has no full-time employees. There are currently no employment agreements with our officers and directors, and although the Company does not believe this will occur, our officers and directors may choose to terminate their employment at any time. The Company’s activities are managed by the Company’s Directors and Officers.
 
The officers of the Company have the same powers and duties with respect to the management of the business affairs for the Company and the oversight of the day-to-day management operations for the Company as officers of a business would have. They perform such other reasonable duties (taking into consideration the person’s position in the Company) as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors of the Company from time to time. They are obligated to use best efforts to serve the Company faithfully and promote its best interests and shall devote all of his or her business time, attention and services to the faithful and competent discharge of such duties.
