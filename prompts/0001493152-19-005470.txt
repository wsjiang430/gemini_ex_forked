ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Throughout this document we use the following terms: Barocycler®, PULSE®, and BioSeq®, which are registered trademarks of the Company. We also use the terms ProteoSolveTM, ProteoSolveLRSTM, the Power of PCTTM, the PCT ShredderTM, HUB440TM, HUB880TM, micro-PestleTM, PCT-HDTM, BaroFoldTM, BarozymeTM and BaroFlexTM Strips, Ultra Shear Technology, and UST™ all of which are unregistered trademarks of the Company.
 
Overview
 
We are focused on solving the challenging problems inherent in biological sample preparation, a crucial laboratory step performed by scientists worldwide working in biological life sciences research. Sample preparation is a term that refers to a wide range of activities that precede most forms of scientific analysis. Sample preparation is often complex, time-consuming and, in our belief, one of the most error-prone steps of scientific research. It is a widely-used laboratory undertaking – the requirements of which drive what we believe is a large and growing worldwide market. We have developed and patented a novel, enabling technology platform that can control the sample preparation process. It is based on harnessing the unique properties of high hydrostatic pressure. This process, which we refer to as Pressure Cycling Technology, or PCT, uses alternating cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels i.e., 20,000 psi or greater to safely, conveniently and reproducibly control the actions of molecules in biological samples, such as cells and tissues from human, animal, plant and microbial sources.
 
PCT is an enabling platform technology based on a physical process that had not previously been used to control bio-molecular interactions. PCT uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra-high levels at controlled temperatures and specific time intervals, to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio-molecules, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules. Our laboratory instrument family, the Barocycler®, and our internally developed consumables product line, which include our unique MicroTubes, MicroCaps, MicroPestles, BaroFlex and PULSE® (Pressure Used to Lyse Samples for Extraction) Tubes, and application specific kits (containing consumable products and reagents), together make up our PCT Sample Preparation System (the “PCT SPS”).
 
In 2015, together with an investment bank, we formed a subsidiary called Pressure BioSciences Europe (“PBI Europe”) in Poland. We have 49% ownership interest with the investment bank retaining 51%. Throughout 2018, PBI Europe did not have any operating activities and we cannot reasonably predict when operations will commence. Therefore, we don’t have control of the subsidiary and did not consolidate them in our financial statements.
 
Patents
 
To date, we have been granted 15 United States and foreign patents related to our PCT technology platform, and two additional patents in China related to our Ultra Shear Technology, or UST. We have also received eight patents with our purchase of the assets of BaroFold in December 2017. PCT employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad use in a number of established and emerging life sciences areas, which include, but are not limited to:

● | protein characterization 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | biological sample preparation – including but not limited to sample extraction, homogenization, and digestion - in such study areas as genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, metabolomic and small molecule; 
● | pathogen inactivation; 
● | protein purification; 
● | control of chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic; and 
● | immunodiagnostics. 

 
We are also the exclusive distributor, throughout the Americas, for Constant Systems, Ltd,’s (“CS”) cell disruption equipment, parts, and consumables. CS, a British company located several hours northwest of London, England, has been providing niche biomedical equipment, related consumable products, and services to a global client base since 1989. CS designs, develops, and manufactures high pressure cell disruption equipment required by life sciences laboratories worldwide, particularly disruption systems for the extraction of proteins. The CS equipment provides a constant and controlled cell disruptive environment, giving the user superior, constant, and reproducible results whatever the application. CS has over 900 units installed in over 40 countries worldwide. The CS cell disruption equipment has proven performance in the extraction of cellular components, such as protein from yeast, bacteria, mammalian cells, and other sample types.

The CS pressure-based cell disruption equipment and our PCT-based instrumentation complement each other in several important ways. While both the CS and our technologies are based on high pressure, each product line has fundamental scientific capabilities that the other does not offer. Our PCT Platform uses certain patented pressure mechanisms to achieve small-scale, molecular level effects. CS’s technology uses different, proprietary pressure mechanisms for larger-scale, non-molecular level processing. In a number of routine laboratory applications, such as protein extraction, both effects can be critical to success. Therefore, for protein extraction and a number of other important scientific applications, we believe laboratories will benefit by using the CS and our products, either separately or together.
 
Primary Fields of Use and Application for PCT
 
Sample preparation is widely regarded as a significant impediment to research and discovery and sample extraction is generally regarded as one of the key parts of sample preparation. The process of preparing samples for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies includes a crucial step called sample extraction or sample disruption. This is the process of extracting biomolecules such as nucleic acid i.e., DNA and/or RNA, as well as proteins, lipids, or small molecules from the plant or animal cells and tissues that are being studied. Our current commercialization efforts are based upon our belief that pressure cycling technology provides a superior solution for sample extraction when compared to other available technologies or procedures and thus might significantly improve the quality of sample preparation, and thus the quality of the test result.
 
Within the broad field of biological sample preparation, in particular sample extraction, we focus the majority of our PCT and constant pressure (“CP”) product development efforts in three specific areas: biomarker discovery (primarily through mass spectrometric analysis), forensics and histology. We believe that our existing PCT and CP-based instrumentation and related consumable products fill an important and growing need in the sample preparation market for the safe, rapid, versatile, reproducible and quality extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from a wide variety of plant, animal, and microbiological cells and tissues.
 
Biomarker Discovery - Mass Spectrometry
 
A biomarker is any substance (e.g., protein, DNA) that can be used as an indicator of the presence, absence or stage of a particular disease-state or condition, and/or to measure or predict the progression and effects of therapy. Biomarkers can help in the diagnosis, prognosis, therapy selection, prevention, surveillance, control, and cure of diseases and medical conditions.
 
A mass spectrometer is a laboratory instrument used in the analysis of biological samples, often focused on proteins, in life sciences research. It is frequently used to help discover biomarkers. According to the November 2017 published market report by Markets and Markets “Mass Spectrometry Market by Application (Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology, Environmental testing), Platform (Single mass spectrometry (Quadrupole, TOF & Ion Trap), Hybrid mass spectrometry (Triple Quadrupole, QTOF & FTMS)) – Global Forecast to 2022, the global mass spectrometry market is expected to grow from USD 3.44 billion in 2016 to USD 5.27 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 7.4% from 2015 to 2020.
 
Forensics
 
The detection of DNA has become a part of the analysis of forensic samples by laboratories and criminal justice agencies worldwide in their efforts to identify the perpetrators of violent crimes and missing persons. Scientists from the University of North Texas and Florida International University have reported improvements in DNA yield from forensic samples (e.g., bone and hair) when using the PCT platform in the sample preparation process. We believe that PCT may be capable of differentially extracting DNA from sperm cells and female epithelial cells captured in swabs collected from rape victims and subsequently stored in rape kits. We also believe that there are many completed rape kits that remain untested for reasons such as cost, time and quality of results. We further believe that the ability to differentially extract DNA from sperm and not epithelial cells could reduce the cost of such testing, while increasing the quality, safety and speed of the testing process.

Histology
 
The most commonly used technique worldwide for the preservation of cancer and other tissues for long-term storage and subsequent pathology evaluation is to process them into formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (“FFPE”) samples. We believe that the quality and analysis of FFPE tissues is highly problematic, and that PCT offers significant advantages over current processing methods, including standardization, speed, biomolecule recovery, and safety.
 
Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and other life science institutions in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration in these target areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler® instrumentation to additional laboratories at current customer institutions.
 
If we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base could expand to include hospitals, reference laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants and other sites involved in each specific application. If we are successful in forensics, our potential customers could be forensic laboratories, military and other government agencies. If we are successful in histology (extraction of biomolecules from FFPE tissues), our potential customers could be pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and laboratories focused on drug discovery or correlation of disease states.

Sample Preparation for Genomic, Proteomic, Lipidomic and Small Molecule Studies
 
The Market
 
Since February 2005, we have focused substantially all of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation for genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule studies. This market is comprised of academic and government research institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and other public and private laboratories that are engaged in studying genomic, proteomic and small molecule material within plant and animal cells and tissues. We elected to initially focus our resources in the market of genomic, proteomic and small molecule sample preparation because we believe it is an area that:

● | is a rapidly growing market;

Company Products
 
We believe our PCT and CP products allow researchers to improve scientific research studies in the life sciences field. Our products are developed with the expectation of meeting or exceeding the needs of research scientists while enhancing the safety, speed and quality that is available to them with existing sample preparation methods.
Barocycler® Instrumentation
 
Our Barocycler® product line consists of laboratory instrumentation that subjects a sample to cycles of pressure from ambient (approximately 14.5 psi) to ultra-high levels (20,000 psi or greater) and then back to ambient, in a precisely controlled manner.
 
Our instruments (the 2320EXT, the Barozyme-HT48, the Barocycler® NEP3229, the HUB440 and the HUB880) use cycles of high, hydrostatic pressure to quickly and efficiently break up the cellular structures of a specimen to release proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and small molecules from the specimen into our consumable processing tubes, referred to as our PULSE® Tubes and MicroTubes. Our instruments have temperature control options (on-board heating or chilling via internal heating jacket or external circulating water-bath), automatic fill and dispensing valves, and an integrated keypad or touchscreen for interfacing with an onboard micro-processor or computer. The microprocessor, computer or laptop computer are capable of saving specific PCT protocols, so the researcher can achieve maximum reproducibility for the preparation of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or small molecules from various biological samples. Our Barocycler® instruments and our consumable products make up our PCT Sample Preparation System.
 
Barocycler® 2320EXTREME - The Barocycler® 2320EXT is the flagship of the Company’s Barocycler line of PCT-based instruments. It weighs approximately 80lbs, has a maximum pressure of 45,000 psi, and can process either up to 16 MicroTubes simultaneously or one PULSE® Tube. The working temperature range is 4 – 95ºC and is controlled via an on-board electric heating jacket or external circulating water bath. All tests are entered and recorded on a touch screen interface. Information from each test run (pressure profile, cycle number, and temperature) is recorded and can be stored on the instrument, on a USB drive, or networked into the user’s lab computer system. Pressure profiles can be manipulated in a number of ways, including static high pressure holds and pressure ramp programs. The Barocycler® 2320EXT is pneumatic, and requires an input air source of only 100psi to achieve and cycle at high pressure.

-


The Barocycler® 2320EXT was developed to support the PCT-HD/PCT-SWATH application. PCT-HD enables faster, less cumbersome and higher quality processing of biopsy tissues. With homogenization, extraction, and digestion of proteins occurring in a single PCT MicroTube under high pressure, this protocol can yield analytical results in under four hours from the start of tissue processing. PCT-HD was developed by our scientists and engineers in collaboration with Professor Ruedi Aebersold and Dr. Tiannan Guo of the Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, and the University of Zurich, both in Zurich, Switzerland. Drs. Aebersold and Guo combined PCT-HD with SCIEX’s SWATH-Mass Spectrometry – calling the resulting method “PCT-SWATH”.
 
Barocycler® NEP3229 – The Barocycler® NEP3229 contains two units – a user interface and a power source – comprised primarily of a 1.5 horsepower motor and hydrolic pump assembly. Combined, the two components of the NEP3229 weigh approximately 350 pounds. The Barocycler® NEP3229 is capable of processing up to three samples simultaneously using our specially designed, single-use PULSE® Tubes and up to 48 samples simultaneously using our specially-designed MicroTubes.
 
Barozyme HT48 - The Barozyme HT48 is a high throughput, bench-top instrument designed for accelerated enzymatic digestion of proteins at high pressure. A typical protein digestion time using the enzyme trypsin (a common yet important laboratory procedure) can be reduced from often requiring an overnight incubation to achieve completion, to under one hour when the digestion procedure is carried out with PCT. The Barozyme HT48 uses an air-pressure-to-liquid-pressure proprietary intensifier system, with a pressure amplification ratio of 160:1, to reach an output pressure of 20,000 psi. The Barozyme HT48 is capable of processing up to 48 samples at a time in six single-use BaroFlex 8-well Strips in the Barozyme Sample Carrier. This design allows for the 8-well strips to be utilized in standard 48 or 96 well plate formats that are compatible with other high-throughput laboratory automation systems.
 
Barocycler® HUB440 –We believe the Barocycler® HUB440 is the first portable, ready to use, “plug-and-play” high pressure generator for the laboratory bench. The Barocycler® HUB440 is capable of creating and controlling hydrostatic pressure from 500 psi to 58,000 psi and is designed for easy and flexible interfacing with a wide variety of user-specified pressure vessels. It is computer controlled and runs on software that was specially-written by us in LabVIEW (software from National Instruments Corporation). We own the rights and have a license to use the specialty LabVIEW software. We believe that over the coming years, the Barocycler® HUB440 may become the main instrument in our pressure-based instrument line.
 
Barocycler® HUB880 - The Barocycler® HUB880 is a compact, portable, bench-top, ultra-high pressure generator with vessel interface flexibility similar to the HUB440, that uses an air pressure-to-liquid pressure intensifier allowing the user to generate fluid pressure as high as 90,000 psi with input air pressure of just 126 psi. The HUB880 can be operated through a simple front panel or controlled using an optional external Data Acquisition and Control Module for dynamic pressure control. We believe that the HUB880 will be well accepted by scientists that need to achieve super high pressure, such as those working in the food safety and vaccine industries.
 
Ultra Shear Technology (UST) – UST is an emerging technology that combines intense fluid shear with and instant, short-lived burst of heat achieved by specialized high pressure equipment to produce commercially sterile, pumpable, homogeneous fluid products. The UST process achieves energetic cellular disruption and results in the inactivation of bacteria, bacterial spores, viruses, and enzymes. Depending on operating conditions, low nano-scale emulsions (nanoemulsions) or oil and water mixtures can be produced that have been shown to have improved shelf stability, flavor, absorption and bioavailability.
 
The Company received two UST patents in China, focusedon a low cost, scalable approach for product manufacturing. The Company believes this method can find use in various nanoemulsion applications for pharmaceutical (e.g., drug delivery), biotechnology (e.g., protein recovery, biomolecule extraction), and food (e.g., shelf-stable “clean label” products). We plan to design, develop, manufacture, and market a lab-scale UST-based production instrument that we will sell direct to the life sciences and other industries. We also plan to develop a pilot plant scale UST-based production instrument for larger-scale production demonstrations, in our expectation to license the technology to food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and other companies worldwide.
 
The Shredder SG3 –The Shredder SG3 is a low shear mechanical homogenization system for use with tough, fibrous and other difficult-to-disrupt tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 System uses a variety of Shredder PULSE® Tubes to directly and rapidly grind a biological sample which, when combined with selected buffers, can provide effective extraction of proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids and small molecules from tissues and organisms. The Shredder SG3 is also used to isolate intact and functional mitochondria from tissues. The Shredder SG3 features a three position force setting lever, which enables the operator to select and apply reproducible force to the sample during the shredding process and eliminates the need for the operator to exert force for long periods when processing one or more samples.
 
Barocycler® Consumable Products
 
PCT MicroTubes – PCT MicroTubes are made from a unique fluoropolymer, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). FEP is highly inert and retains its integrity within an extremely wide temperature range (-200oC to +100oC), while providing important limited flexibility behavior for PCT applications. MicroTubes hold a maximum total volume of 150 microliters. PCT MicroTubes must be used with either PCT-MicroCaps or PCT-MicroPestles.
 
PCT-MicroCaps – PCT MicroCaps are made from polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). The PCT MicroCaps are available in three sizes to accommodate total sample volume: 50, 100 and 150uL. 50uL MicroCaps are used with samples ≤50uL, 100uL MicroCaps are used with samples between 50-100uL, and 150uL MicroCaps are used with samples between 100-150uL.

--


PCT-Micro Pestle - PCT μPestles are made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, also known as Teflon (by DuPont Co). PTFE is practically inert; the only chemicals known to affect it are certain alkali metals and most highly-reactive fluorinating agents. PCT μPestles, in conjunction with PCT MicroTubes, are designed to enhance the extraction of proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA and small molecules from minute amounts (0.5 – 3.0 mg) of solid tissue in extraction reagent volumes as low as 20-30 μL. PCT MicroTubes and PCT μPestles use PCT to effectively disrupt soft tissues and lyse their cells. As a result, the tissue sample trapped between the MicroTube walls and the μPestles shaft is crushed on every pressure cycle. This mechanical action, combined with the extraction ability of the buffer under high pressure, results in highly effective tissue homogenization and extraction.
 
PCT μPestles and PCT MicroTubes, together with a PBI Barocycler®, comprise the PCT Micro-Pestle System, which provides a fast, safe, and efficient means of extraction from extremely small amounts of solid samples such as soft tissue biopsies. The PCT μPestle System can be used in any PBI Barocycler®.
 
BaroFlex 8-well Processing Strips - BaroFlex 8-well Strips are used in the Barozyme HT48 (for pressure-enhanced enzymatic digestion at 20,000 psi). BaroFlex 8-well Strips are made of special high density polyethylene (HDPE) and hold up to 140µl per well when capped with the BaroFlex Cap Strips or Mats. BaroFlex 8-Cap Strips and BaroFlex 24-Cap Mats are made of silicone. These single-use caps are designed to seal BaroFlex 8-well Strips tightly and to prevent fluid exchange between the sample and the Barozyme chamber fluid during pressure cycling. The silicone caps are available as strips of eight, or mats of 24 caps.
 
We believe our development of these various consumable products has helped, and will continue to help, drive the adoption of PCT within the life sciences market.
 
Company Services
 
BaroFold Contract Services
 
Our BaroFold contract services can be used to significantly impact and improve the quality oflarge-molecule protein biotherapeutics. These services employ high pressure manipulations for the disaggregation and unfolding of proteins to their native structural states and then controlled refolding of the proteins to the desired therapeutically active state, at yields and efficiencies not achievable using existing technologies. The Barofold Platform has been shown to eliminate protein aggregation during biotherapeutic drug manufacturing and storage, thereby improving product yield, efficacy and safety for both new-drug entities and biosimilar products. The Barofold platform can help companies create novel protein therapeutics, accelerate therapeutic protein development, manufacture follow-on biologics, and enable life-cycle management of protein therapeutics. It is scalable and practical for standard manufacturing processes. This unique technology platform can help protein-based biopharmaceutical companies create and manufacture high quality, novel protein therapeutics and lower the cost of existing formulations. Research and manufacturing licenses are available.
Government Grants and Contracts
 
We view federal agency grants to be an important part of our business plan. These types of grants allow us to bill the federal agency for work that we are planning to perform as part of the development and commercialization of our technology. We generally start by submitting initial grant requests that are in response to requests for proposals (“RFPs”) from the federal government through their Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) program. Initial (“SBIR Phase I”) grants are meant to fund approved research projects for six months, and generally have budgets of approximately $100,000 to $150,000. Because our work in SBIR Phase I grants has been successful, we have applied, and may in the future apply for larger National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) SBIR Phase II grants. Such larger grants are typically for a two-year period and can offer as much as $1,000,000 to support significant research projects in areas we would otherwise expect to support with internal funds should SBIR Phase II grants not be awarded. To date, we have been awarded five NIH SBIR Phase I grants and three SBIR Phase II grants. The data on three of the NIH SBIR Phase I grants were the basis for the submission, and subsequent award, of applicable SBIR II grants. Of the three NIH SBIR Phase II grants awarded to us: one was in the approximate amount of $845,000 in August 2008, the second was in the approximate amount of $850,000 in September 2011, and the third award was in the approximate amount of $1,020,000 awarded in November 2014. All five of the NIH SBIR Phase I grants and the August 2008 and September 2011, NIH SBIR Phase II grants have been completed. We received an extension on the SBIR Phase II grant, awarded in November 2014, to utilize unused funds until November 30, 2018.

The 2008 SBIR Phase II grant (2R44GM079059) was awarded to us by the NIH for work in the area of using PCT to extract proteins, sub-cellular molecular complexes, and organelles, with the expectation that these studies might ultimately lead to the release of a new, commercially available PCT-based system, with validated protocols, end-user kits, and other consumables intended for the extraction of clinically important protein biomarkers, sub-cellular molecular complexes, and organelles from human and animal tissues. The 2011 SBIR II contract (W81XWH-10-C-0-175) was awarded to us by the U.S. Army for the development of a universal method for the inactivation, extraction, and enrichment of pathogens in diagnostic samples, including arthropod hosts of military importance. The work covered by this grant was significant in helping us develop the Barozyme HT48 High Throughput System. The 2014 SBIR Phase II grant (2R44HG007136) was awarded to us by the National Human Genome Research Institute of the NIH. Entitled “High Pressure Sample Preparation Instrumentation for DNA Sequencing”, this grant allowed us to develop the Barocycler HUB880, an automated, high-throughput, high pressure system (instrument and consumables), to enable significantly better control of DNA fragmentation - a critical step in the preparation of samples for Next Generation Sequencing platforms. This system was based on significant technological advancements over the classic hydrodynamic DNA shearing approach that has been successfully and widely used in the field of DNA sequencing for many years.
 
Extended Service Contracts
 
We offer extended service contracts on our laboratory instrumentation to all of our customers. These service contracts allow a customer who purchases a Barocycler® instrument to receive on-site scheduled preventative maintenance, on-site repair and replacement of all worn or defective component parts, and telephone support, all at no incremental cost for the life of the service contract. We offer one-year and four-year extended service contracts to customers who purchase Barocycler® instruments.
 
Other Fields of Use and Applications for PCT
 
Our research and development efforts have shown that, in addition to genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, PCT is potentially beneficial in a number of other areas of the life sciences, including pathogen inactivation, protein purification, control of chemical (particularly enzymatic) reactions, and immunodiagnostics. Other applications in the sample preparation market include forensics and histology, as discussed above. Our pursuit of these markets, however, depends on a number of factors, including our success in commercializing PCT in the area of sample preparation, our judgment regarding the investment required to be successful in these areas, the value of these markets to PBI, and the availability of sufficient financial resources. Below is a brief explanation of each of these additional potential applications and a short description of why we believe PCT can be used to improve scientific studies in these areas.
 
Pathogen Inactivation
 
Biological products intended for human use, such as blood, vaccines and drugs, are put through rigorous processing protocols in an effort to minimize the potential of that product to transmit disease. These protocols may include methods to remove infectious materials such as pre-processing testing, filtration or chromatography, or methods to inactivate infectious agents that are not captured in the removal steps such as pasteurization, irradiation and solvent detergent inactivation. Notwithstanding current diligence in both the removal and inactivation steps, significant concern remains that some pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, spores) capable of transmitting infection to recipients may not be removed or inactivated with current procedures. In addition, some removal and inactivation methods may not be useful because of cost, safety, ease-of-use or other practical concerns. To that end, we believe that a superior inactivation method is needed that can safely, rapidly and inexpensively inactivate pathogens in blood, vaccines and drugs without the need for chemical or other potentially toxic additives and that we have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current procedures, a process that uses PCT has the potential to increase safety and yield, lower cost and decrease the potential side effects of current methods. We have been issued U.S. patents for this PCT-dependent inactivation technology.
Protein Purification
 
Many vaccines and drugs are comprised of proteins. These proteins need to be purified from complex mixtures as part of the manufacturing process. Current purification techniques often result in the loss of a significant amount of the protein. Therefore, any method that could increase the amount of protein being recovered in the purification step, could subsequently lead to a reduction in cost to the manufacturer. We believe we have successfully generated proof-of-concept that PCT can satisfy this need. We believe that compared with current purification procedures, a process that uses PCT has the potential to increase protein recovery, increase the quality of the product, and lower production costs. We have been issued U.S. patents in this area.
Control of Chemical (Particularly Enzymatic) Reactions
 
Chemical reactions encompass many important interactions in nature. Methods used to control chemical reactions could have a positive effect on the quality, speed, and overall result of the reaction. The control and detection of chemical reactions is particularly useful in the biotechnology field for synthesizing and characterizing such molecules as nucleic acids and polypeptides. We believe that PCT offers distinct advantages in controlling chemical reactions over current methods, since PCT can provide precise, automated control over the timing and synchronization of chemical reactions, particularly enzymatic reactions. We have been issued U.S patents in this area.

Immunodiagnostics
 
Many tests used in the clinical laboratory today are based on the formation of a complex between two proteins, such as an antigen and an antibody. Such “immunodiagnostic” methods are used for the detection of infectious agents such as the human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), hepatitis viruses, West Nile virus, and others, as well as for endocrine, drug testing and cancer diagnostics. We have generated proof-of-concept that PCT may be used to control biomolecular interactions between proteins, such as antigens and antibodies. We believe this capability may provide a greater degree of sensitivity and quantitative accuracy in immunodiagnostic testing than that offered by methods that are available today. We have been issued U.S. patents in this area.
 
Acquisition of BaroFold’s PreEMT™ high-pressure protein refolding technology in December 2017
 
BaroFold’s assets have significantly increased PBI’s intellectual property portfolio in high-pressure technologies with the addition of eight issued and several pending patents. These patents give PBI the ability to operate in several important areas for biologics research and manufacturing: protein folding, re-folding and disaggregation. The patents also provide PBI the right to grant licenses to third parties to practice the BaroFold and other technologies in both research laboratories and in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.
 
Biopharmaceutical products are typically large-molecule protein therapeutics produced via complex biological manufacturing processes that can result in undesirable protein misfolding and aggregation outcomes. Misfolded or aggregated proteins typically lack therapeutic activity and can present health risks to patients, requiring robust remediation within pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The Barofold technology improves the quality of manufacturing, decreases manufacturing costs (as much as $2-10M/year per commercial biologic drug), and facilitates achievement of proper activity from difficult-to-manufacture proteins.
 
Customers
 
Our customers include researchers at academic laboratories, government agencies, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical firms, and other life science institutions throughout the Americas; Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. Our goal is to continue aggressive market penetration to target groups in these geographical areas. We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to sell and/or lease additional Barocycler® instrumentation to additional laboratories at current customer institutions.
 
If we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, and if we are successful in our attempts to attract additional capital, our potential customer base could expand to include hospitals, reference laboratories, pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, and other sites involved in each specific application. If we are successful in forensics, our potential customers could be forensic laboratories, military and other government agencies. If we are successful in histology (extraction of biomolecules from FFPE tissues), our potential customers could be pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and laboratories focused on drug discovery or correlation of disease states.
 
Competition
 
We compete with companies that have existing technologies for the extraction of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules from cells and tissues, including methods such as mortar and pestle grinding, sonication, rotor-stator homogenization, French Press, bead beating, freezer milling, enzymatic digestion, and chemical dissolution. We believe that there are a number of significant issues related to the use of these methods, including: complexity, sample containment, cross-contamination, shearing of biomolecules of interest, limited applicability to different sample types, ease-of-use, reproducibility, and cost. We believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System offers a number of significant advantages over these methods, including:

● | labor reduction | ● | versatility
--+-------------------------+---+------------
● | temperature control | ● | efficiency 
● | precision | ● | simplicity 
● | reproducibility | ● | safety 

 
To be competitive in the industry, we believe we must be able to clearly and conclusively demonstrate to potential customers that our products provide these improved performance capabilities. We strongly believe that our PCT Sample Preparation System is a novel and enabling system for genomic, proteomic, and small molecule sample preparation. As such, many users of current manual techniques will need to be willing to challenge their existing methods of sample preparation and invest time to evaluate a method that could change their overall workflow in the sample preparation process, prior to adopting our technology.

Further, we are aware that the cost of the PCT Sample Preparation System may be greater than the cost of many of the other methods currently employed. Consequently, we are focusing our sales efforts on those product attributes that we believe will be most important and appealing to potential customers; namely versatility, reproducibility, quality, and safety.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
CBM Industries (Taunton, MA) is the manufacturer of the Barocycler® 2320EXT. CBM is ISO 13485:2003 and 9001:2008 Certified. CBM provides us with precision manufacturing services that include management support services to meet our specific application and operational requirements. Among the services provided by CBM to us are:

● | CNC Machining 
--+-------------------------------------
● | Contract Assembly & Kitting 
● | Component and Subassembly Design 
● | Inventory Management 
● | ISO certification 

 
At this time, we believe that outsourcing the manufacturing of our Barocycler® 2320EXT to CBM is the most cost-effective method for us to obtain ISO Certified, CE and CSA Marked instruments. CBM’s close proximity to our South Easton, MA facility is a significant asset enabling interactions between our Engineering, R&D, and Manufacturing groups and their counterparts at CBM. CBM was instrumental in helping PBI achieve CE Marking on our Barocycler 2320EXT, as announced on February 2, 2017.
 
Although we currently manufacture and assemble the Barozyme HT48, Barocycler® HUB440, the SHREDDER SG3, and most of our consumables at our South Easton, MA facility, we plan to take advantage of outsourced manufacturing relationships such as that with CBM and outsource manufacturing of the entire Barocycler® product line, future instrument, and other products to CBM.
 
The Barocycler® NEP3229, launched in 2008, and manufactured by the BIT Group, will be phased out over the next several years and replaced by the new state-of-the-art Barocycler® HUB and Barozyme HT product lines.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development activities are split into two functional areas: Applications Development and Engineering.
 

1. | Applications Development R&D: Our highly educated and trained staff has years of experience in molecular and cellular biology, virology, and proteomics. Our team of scientists focuses on the development and continued improvement of the PCT Sample Preparation System and on PCT-dependent genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation applications. Dr. Alexander Lazarev, our Chief Science Officer, meets regularly with our sales, marketing, and engineering staff to discuss market needs and trends. Our applications research and development team is responsible for the technical review of all scientific collaborations, for the support of our marketing and sales departments through the generation of internal data in a number of areas of market interest, and in the development of commercially-viable PCT-dependent products. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Engineering R&D: Our engineering research and development team is focused on the design and development of new and improved instrumentation and consumable products to support the commercialization of PCT. Our engineering department is led by Dr. Edmund Ting, our senior vice president of Engineering.

Collaboration Program
 
Our Collaboration Program is an important element of our business strategy. Initiating a collaboration with a researcher involves the installation of a Barocycler® instrument for an agreed upon period of time of approximately three to twelve months, a financial commitment that is beneficial to both the collaborator and PBI, and the execution of an agreed upon work plan. Our primary objectives for entering into a collaboration agreement include:

● | the development of a new application for PCT and CP in sample preparation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the advancement and validation of our understanding of PCT and CP within an area of life sciences in which we already offer products; 
● | the demonstration of the effectiveness of PCT and CP by specific research scientists, particularly Key Opinion Leaders (“KOLs”), who we believe can have a positive impact on market acceptance of PCT; and 
● | the expectation of peer-reviewed publications and/or presentations at scientific meetings by a third party, especially a KOL, on the merits of PCT and CP. 

 
Since we initiated our collaboration program, third party researchers have cited the use of our PCT platform in multiple publications and presentations. We believe that this program has provided and continues to provide us with independent and objective data about PCT from well-respected laboratories in the United States and throughout the rest of the world. We believe this program has been responsible for the sale of multiple Barocycler instruments over the past few years, and will continue to help to increase the sales of instrument systems in the future.
 
Product Pipeline
 
The following instruments are in our research and development pipeline:
 

● | Barocycler® FFPE Protein Extraction Instrument System - A PCT-based system offering the enhanced extraction of proteins from FFPE samples using a modified Barocycler® instrument that combines the advantages of pressure cycling, high temperature, and certain reagents. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | XstreamPCT™ HPLC Digestion Module - For automated, in-line, on-demand PCT-enhanced protein digestion; the first module in our PCT-based HPLC platform. 

Sales and Marketing
 
Our marketing and sales functions are led by Dr. Bradford Young, our Chief Commercial Officer. Dr. Young oversees and directs all marketing and sales activities, including trade show attendance and sponsorship, on-line advertising, website maintenance and improvement, search engine optimization, creation and dissemination of a PCT newsletter, market research initiatives, the arrangement of on-location seminars, lectures, and demonstrations of PCT capabilities, and the supervision of our two-person sales force. Dr. Young is also responsible for the overall coordination of our collaboration programs, from initial set-up, research plan design, and training, service, and data analysis. Some of these responsibilities are shared with other departments such as Research and Development, but marketing and sales drives the collaborative process. Dr. Young is also responsible for the continued coordination and support of our foreign distribution partners.
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are centered on using the independent data developed and disseminated by our collaboration partners to help drive the installed base of our PCT Sample Preparation System. The development of scientific data by our partners and our internal researchers provides our sales and marketing staff with additional tools that are essential in selling a paradigm-shifting, new technology such as PCT.
 
Sales
 
Direct US Sales Force
 
Our domestic sales force currently consists of one sales director and one field salesperson. Our sales director is currently responsible for servicing the eastern half of the U.S. and our field salesperson handles the western half of the U.S. We expect to hire two additional sales and marketing personnel during 2019, with a goal that our sales and marketing department will have a minimum of four by the end of 2019.
Marketing Strategy
 
We recognize that our enabling pressure cycling technology (PCT) is a powerful, novel platform technology. We also recognize that the power of PCT is not yet generally known by researchers. Our first goal is to greatly broaden the awareness of PCT and its applications among research scientists and to ensure they know that this technology exists through our Barocycler® family of high-pressure instruments and requisite consumables. To accomplish this expansion of knowledge about PCT and the subsequent adoption of our PCT-based products, we have developed and are implementing a multi-faceted approach to marketing the PCT platform.

Key Opinion Leaders and Publications
 
To initially reach scientists, we have established collaborations with key opinion leaders (KOL) who recognized early the potential for PCT and went on to report their discoveries in peer reviewed journals. Among the KOLs working with us is Dr. Ruedi Aebersold (Head of the Department of Biology, ETH, Zurich). Dr. Aebersold, a pioneer in proteomics, worked with our scientists and engineers to develop PCT-SWATH (aka PCT-HD), a superior method for the extraction and preparation of proteins for the downstream analysis by mass spectrometry. Other KOLs include Dr. Jennifer van Eyk (Director of Advanced Clinical Biosystems Institute in the Department of Biomedical Sciences Cedar Sinai, Los Angeles, CA) and Dr. Wayne Hubble (Jules Stein Professor at the University of California, LA). Dr. van Eyk is a recognized expert in the causes of heart disease and is using PCT in her attempt to discover cardiac disease biomarkers. Dr. Hubble, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, is a leader in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). He uses PCT in his studies of protein-protein interactions, so very important in the discovery of drug targets and drug design. The publications and presentations of these and other world class scientists have been invaluable in gaining initial entry of PCT in several areas of research. In addition to publications by our KOLs, there are also many peer reviewed publications from dozens of other scientists discussing the advantages of the PCT platform in bio-molecule sample preparation. To this end, we do all we can to disseminate the work of these scientists in an effort to increase the exposure of PCT to the worldwide research community.
 
Broadcasting PCT and Our Products
 

1. | We attend, exhibit, and present at top scientific meetings such as the American Society of Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) and both the US and International meetings of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO). These meetings are an opportunity to present our technology and to showcase our products to scientists who require sample preparation in their research studies. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Routine and timely “blast” emails to scientists in our database. Topics include new PCT-related publications, announcements of meetings, product advertisements, and a monthly newsletter. The database we use is proprietary, as it has been built from attending scientific meetings and searching the internet for relevant publications and contact information. 
3. | We manage our database with SalesForce, a state-of-the-art Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Through SalesForce, we employ the marketing automation software Pardot to manage our email blasts. Pardot enables us to assess open rates, levels of interest, and to create automatic and constant contact with potential clients. 


4. | We use social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook to broadcast publications, webinars, our presence at scientific meetings, and press releases. Social media enables us to easily reach scientists world-wide. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. | We significantly upgraded our website. The upgraded website contains a state-of-the art search engine that enables researchers to rapidly find PCT-related publications and products. 
6. | The website contains videos of our products. In 2016, we contracted with BioCompare to produce a high quality video showing PCT-HD and the uses of our Barocycler® 2320EXT and the MicroTube System. 
7. | Our scientists regularly present their findings and discuss our products at scientific sessions at regional, national, and international scientific conferences, and at corporate, government, and academic laboratories. 
8. | In addition to electronic advertising, we have used and will continue to use print media to showcase our products. 

 
In 2019, we plan to expand our Marketing team to support these and additional initiatives.
 
Foreign Distributor Network
 
Exclusive Agreements

Intellectual Property
 
We believe that protection of our patents and other intellectual property is essential to our business. Subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources, our practice is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements to inventions that are important to our business development. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological innovations to develop and maintain our potential competitive position.
 
To date, we have been granted 15 United States and foreign patents related to our PCT technology platform, and two additional patents in China related to our Ultra Shear Technology. We also received eight patents with our purchase of the assets of BaroFold in December 2017.
 
Our issued patents expire between 2018 and 2030. Our failure to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection may adversely affect our ability to enter into, or affect the terms of, any arrangement for the marketing or sale of any of our PCT products. It may also allow our competitors to duplicate our products without our permission and without compensation.
 
License Agreements Relating to Pressure Cycling Technology
 
BioMolecular Assays, Inc.
 
In 1996, we acquired our initial equity interest in BioSeq, Inc., which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology. BioSeq, Inc. acquired its pressure cycling technology from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement. In 1998, we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of BioSeq, Inc., and at such time, the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc., a 5% royalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that BioSeq, Inc. acquired from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. We are also required to pay BioMolecular Assays, Inc. 5% of the proceeds from any sale, transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology. These payment obligations terminated March 7, 2016.
 
In connection with our acquisition of BioSeq, Inc., we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. This license is non-exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by BioMolecular Assays, Inc. solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development. BioMolecular Assays, Inc. is required to pay us a royalty equal to 20% of any license or other fees and royalties, but not including research support and similar payments, it receives in connection with any sale, assignment, license or other transfer of any rights granted to BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under the license. BioMolecular Assays, Inc. was required to pay us these royalties until the expiration in March 2016 of the patents held by BioSeq, Inc. since 1998. We have not received any royalty payments from BioMolecular Assays, Inc. under this license.
 
Battelle Memorial Institute
 
In December 2008, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the Battelle Memorial Institute (“Battelle”). The licensed technology is the subject of a patent application filed by Battelle in 2008 and relates to a method and a system for improving the analysis of protein samples, including through an automated system utilizing pressure and a pre-selected agent to obtain a digested sample in a significantly shorter period of time than current methods, while maintaining the integrity of the sample throughout the preparatory process. In addition to royalty payments on net sales on “licensed products,” we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments for each year that we retain the rights outlined in the patent license agreement and we are required to have our first commercial sale of the licensed products within one year following the issuance of the patent covered by the licensed technology. After re-negotiating the terms of the contract in 2013, the minimum annual royalty was $1,200 in 2014 and $2,000 in 2015; the minimum royalties are $3,000 in 2016, $4,000 in 2017 and $5,000 in 2018 and each calendar year thereafter during the term of the agreement.

Regulation
 
Many of our activities are subject to regulation by governmental authorities within the United States and similar bodies outside of the United States. The regulatory authorities may govern the collection, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, transportation, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products, as well as the training of our employees.
 
Currently, all of our commercialization efforts are focused in the area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation. We do not believe that our current Barocycler® products used in sample preparation are considered “medical devices” under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDA Act”) and we do not believe that we are subject to the law’s general control provisions that include requirements for registration, listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. We also do not believe that we are subject to regulatory inspection and scrutiny. If, however, we are successful in commercializing PCT in applications beyond our current focus area of genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and small molecule sample preparation, such as protein purification, pathogen inactivation and immunodiagnostics, our products may be considered “medical devices” under the FDA Act, at which point we would be subject to the law’s general control provisions and regulation by the FDA that include requirements for registration listing of devices, quality regulations, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration. The process of obtaining approval to market these devices in the other potential applications of PCT would be costly and time consuming and could possibly prohibit us from pursuing such markets.
 
Some of our devices may also become subject to the European Pressure Equipment Directive, which requires certain pressure equipment meet certain quality and safety standards. We do not believe that we are currently subject to this directive because our Barocycler® instruments are below the threshold documented in the text of the directive. If our interpretation were to be challenged, we could incur significant costs defending the challenge, and we could face production and selling delays, all of which could harm our business.
 
We self-certified that our Barocycler® instrumentation was electromagnetically compatible, or “CE” compliant, which means that our Barocycler® instruments meet the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environmental protection legislation. In order to maintain our CE Marking, a requirement to sell equipment in many countries of the European Union, we are obligated to uphold certain safety and quality standards. Due to outsourcing manufacturing to CBM, an ISO certified contract manufacturer, we believe compliance with CE and other required marks and certifications is well controlled.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had seventeen (17) full-time employees and six (6) part-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. Subject to our limited financial resources, we attempt to maintain employee benefit plans to enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with us.
