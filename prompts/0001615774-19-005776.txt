● | Browning Productions & Entertainment, Inc. (“Browning Productions”) - a full service video production company and executive producer for all entertainment projects.

The Company is based in the United States of America, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.
 
Entertainment Production Services (Love House and Browning Productions)
 
The primary business of Love House and Browning Productions are entertainment production services. Video projects are divided into four parts: (i) pre-production, (ii) production, (iii) post-production and (iv) distribution. During pre-production, the client describes the need and the purpose of the production. Production is the part of the process where raw materials that will be formed into the final product are created. Post-production is where the first rough cut of the final product is created. Client input is then used to create the final version of the production.

Video production services through Browning Productions include production of television shows, commercials, corporate videos, music videos, film, motion pictures (full length features), make-up and hair, casting, writing, producing, directing, stunts, post production services, graphic design (animation and special effects), audio production, and audio mastering and integration. Music production services through Love House include recording (including music production, arranging, mixing and mastering), songwriting (arranging writing sessions with experienced and multi-platinum writers), artist development, digital distribution, billboard chart promotion, branding and advertising, video and photo production, and consulting and life coaching.
 
Browning Productions has produced and has ownership rights to dozens of national and international television programs currently airing on a number of the most recognized television networks including A&E, FYI and History Channel. Browning Productions distributes content on a proprietary Internet/Over-The-Top (“OTT”) content platform that operates in conjunction with Verizon Digital Media Services (“VDMS”). Current productions of Browning Productions include “Wine Warriors”; the spin-off “Whisky Warriors, for which Browning Productions recently secured the Big Sky Film Grant from the State of Montana’s Film Office, “Training Grounds”; a new docuseries called “The Cryptos,” unveiling the inner workings of the cryptocurrency industry, soon to be distributed on one of the world’s most widely recognized global business news networks; and “America’s Crowdfunding,” an equity crowd-funding television series (the concept is “Shark Tank” meets “America’s Got Talent,” where the viewers vote with their wallets for equity stakes in the featured companies) in conjunction with Equity Bender, among others.
 
We also provide through Browning Productions marketing services and branded entertainment. Branding and name recognition is generally achieved through exposure in repetition. Through branded entertainment, a product or service stands out throughout a television series in precise placement from segment to segment for each viewer to see or hear, where the product or service is referred or mentioned by the celebrity cast. The pinnacle of all product or service inclusion into television is to allow for a full integration into the storyline and scripting of the segments centering the brand in the show content, which we believe is one of the best forms of marketing for any product or service.
 
The recording studio of Love House is a facility for sound recording and mixing. Ideally both the recording and monitoring spaces are specially designed by an acoustician to achieve optimum acoustic properties (acoustic isolation or diffusion or absorption of reflected sound that could otherwise interfere with the sound heard by the listener). The typical recording studio consists of a room called the "studio" or "live room", where instrumentalists and vocalists perform; and the "control room", where sound engineers sometimes with producer(s) as well operate either professional audio mixing consoles or computers with specialized software suites to manipulate and route the sound for analogue or digital recording. Often, there will be smaller rooms called "isolation booths" present to accommodate loud instruments such as drums or electric guitar, to keep these sounds from being audible to the microphones that are capturing the sounds from other instruments, or to provide "drier" rooms for recording vocals or quieter acoustic instruments.
 
Our recording studios through Love House may be used to record musicians, voice-over artists for advertisements or dialogue replacement in film, television or animation, foley, or to record their accompanying musical soundtracks.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths through Browning Productions include:
 
Excellent reputation:    We believe we have earned an excellent reputation for our creative ability, innovation, execution and on-time delivery of complex and challenging media content.
 
Our creative storytelling capabilities:    We believe our creative content turns ideas into visual, relatable stories that resonate with consumers and influences their behavior. We believe that our years of experience and access to creative talent allow us to tell compelling stories whether in seconds or minutes.

Diverse, creative talent base:    We employ or represent directors and designers, technical directors and other artists who we believe deliver a unique combination of creative direction (character, world and story development) and execution (unique and high quality imagery and related production content).
 
Strong relationships with advertising agencies and brands:    We have produced highly successful and creative advertising campaigns for our customers, many of which are global brands which we believe have allowed us to develop long-standing, strong relationships with leading advertising agencies and brands. We are often commissioned to create multiple campaigns for brands over many years, acting as the go-to production company for these clients. In addition, despite that some of our competitors are larger than us, we have been able to compete effectively with them and win projects from new and existing clients.
 
End-to end solution:    We have developed in-house production processes that enable us to serve as a one-stop-shop, providing a full suite of solutions to the advertising industry and brands. We are able to conduct a project from concept through design and all stages of production using in-house and contracted creative talent when necessary.
 
We believe our competitive strengths through Love House include:
 
High quality services: We provide high quality sound recording and audio production services. We have a high end recording and production studio for use for customers. Use of the studio is billed on an hourly basis plus fees relating to the rental of the studio. Reproduction of recorded materials will also be sold to customers. The benefits that are afforded to clients in our studio include:

Supplemental Services to Music Production: We also provide songwriting (arranging writing sessions with experienced and multi-platinum writers), artist development, digital distribution, billboard chart promotion, branding and advertising, video and photo production.
 
Competition
 
The team at Love Media House, headed by Chis Rodriguez, has worked with many famous artists and achieved many Billboard numbers giving Love House an important edge in promoting new talent. The team at Browning Productions, headed by William Browning, has produced and has ownership rights to dozens of national and international television programs currently airing on a number of the most recognized television networks including A&E, FYI and History Channel. Notwithstanding, the entertainment marketplace is highly competitive. There are few barriers of entry in the business and level of competition is extremely high. There are many video production companies and recording studios in United States. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. 
Our Industry 
 
We create branded advertising and entertainment content primarily for television, digital and other platforms.

The global advertising market is large and growing.    Global advertising spending was a $591 billion global market in 2017, projected to grow to $724 billion in 2020, according to eMarketer. The U.S. is currently Browning Productions’ customers’ primary target market. eMarketer forecasts that the U.S. will have the largest share of global advertising spending in 2020, which it estimates will be $243 billion. As Browning Productions’ business grows, we expect to capitalize on the large and expanding demand for services such as Browning Productions.
 
Television spending continues to be strong.    Television has historically been the single largest advertising medium worldwide. Zenith forecasts that television advertising in the U.S. peaked in 2017 at $69 billion and will decline slightly to $66 billion in 2020. Television and online video together are becoming more important to advertisers seeking to build brands than either form alone.
 
Digital advertising spending is increasing.    Digital technologies have transformed media consumption, viewing habits and social interaction. Content is being viewed at ever-increasing rates on wired and wireless smart devices across the globe. In 2017, global digital advertising spending surpassed global television advertising spending for the first time, according to MAGNA. MAGNA projects that, in 2018, U.S. digital advertising spending will exceed $100 billion and will account for half of total U.S. advertising sales for the first time. MAGNA projects that U.S. digital advertising sales will be $163 billion by 2023.
 
Creative short-form video content attracts audiences.    Given the proliferation of entertainment channels, capturing the attention of audiences is becoming increasingly challenging. We believe that brands are seeking creative content in short-form video that includes animation and mixed media to evoke emotions that resonate with viewers. According to AOL Advertising, while online video consumption is increasing across all video lengths, short-form video is growing the fastest. According to AOL Advertising, 59% of consumers watch videos that are under one minute long every day.
 
Our Growth Strategy 
 
We intend to build upon our proven ability to aggregate large audiences for brands by continuing to make compelling content that is viewable on both traditional and new platforms. We have begun to implement the growth strategies described below, and expect to continue to do so over the several years following this offering. Although the net proceeds of this offering will be available to assist us to implement our growth strategies, we cannot estimate the ultimate amount of capital needed to achieve our expected growth. We may need additional capital to implement these strategies, particularly in the event we pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies.
 
We intend to grow our business by:
 
Capitalizing on market trends in advertising and digital media:    We believe our long history of creating award-winning content for television provides us with the expertise to continue to capture television advertising spending. We also believe our expertise in delivering entertaining, narrative-based short-form video content positions us well for the expected growth in digital advertising. We intend to build our core business by leveraging the increased use of animation and visual effects to differentiate marketing messages and capture audiences in the growing digital media market.
 
Implementing client service teams:    We believe we can increase recurring work from our existing clients with a more client-focused approach to delivering our services. We are hiring account directors with knowledge of the needs of brands in key industries so that we can collaborate more closely with brands and the advertising agencies. By doing so, we believe we can get involved earlier and more intimately in a particular pitch.
 
Expanding direct-to-brand sales:    Brands are increasingly working directly with content creators, bypassing advertising agencies. We believe this industry disruption is being caused by the desire of brands to obtain greater cost-effectiveness, transparency and control over customer data. We believe that we can increase our direct-to-brand sales by increasing business development efforts with brands. We recently reorganized our sales organization to include a specific focus on brand management.

Growing through acquisitions:    We believe that the highly fragmented content creation media industry, which is comprised primarily of small-to-medium-sized private companies, provides us with significant opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions. We intend to pursue acquisitions that provide services within our current core product offerings, extend our geographic reach and expand our product offerings.
 
Cross-selling services:    Our ability to produce diverse, engaging content across various media platforms allows us to offer clients a one-stop-shop for all of their content needs. We intend to cross-sell our various capabilities to drive additional revenue from existing clients and to seek to win new clients.
 
Further developing intellectual property:    We intend to build upon our success in developing original series that we own and license to brands, networks and major and new digital media studios. When we develop an original series, we retain the copyright of that content. By licensing to other platforms portions of the content from original series that we develop, we can create additional revenue streams from development fees, brand license fees, distribution license fees and ancillary sources (such as from foreign viewership).
 
Expanding our geographic presence:    We believe that by expanding our physical presence into select international regions, we will be better able to attract and retain internationally-based brands as clients. With a physical presence outside of the U.S., we believe we can provide better customer service and offer local talent who can work more intimately with internationally-based brands than we can from our offices in the U.S.
 
Expanding our talent roster:    We intend to continue to seek to attract and retain world-class creative and technical talent, thereby increasing our ability to win jobs and build brand equity through additional high quality creative content. We believe that our reputation and our client base will allow us to continue to attract top creative talent.

Acquisition of a Controlling Interest in Banana Whale Studios Pte. Ltd.
 
On May 18, 2018, we entered into and consummated an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Banana Whale Studios Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation (“Banana Whale”), and the founding shareholders of Banana Whale (the “Banana Whale Stockholders”), pursuant to which we acquired 51% of the outstanding shares (“Controlling Interest in Banana Whale”) of Banana Whale in exchange for a number of our shares of common stock to be based upon the earnings of Banana Whale. Banana Whale is a B2B software provider in the $100+ billion-dollar gaming industry focusing on innovation and next generation games and entertainment. As a condition to closing the acquisition, Banana Whale Stockholders demanded and we deposited in escrow for their benefit 7,383,000 shares of our common stock (“OHGI Shares”) with a fair value of $4,983,000 as security for our obligation to issue such shares to which they may become entitled. If the number of shares to which the Banana Whale Stockholders become entitled is less than 7,383,000, the excess shares will be returned to us for cancellation. We also granted Banana Whale the right to use our secure messaging software.
Acquisition of 123Wish Software
 
Pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement on Sale of 123Wish Software dated September 27, 2018 (“Software Sale Agreement”), among us, Once in a Lifetime Platform LLC (“OIALP”), and One Horizon Hong Kong Limited (“OHHK”), OIALP sold and assigned to OHHK eighty percent (80%) of the intellectual property rights to OIALP’s software platform and App that underlies 123Wish’s business in exchange for our making an additional investment of $100,000 into 123Wish without requiring the minority shareholders in 123Wish (some of whom are members of OIALP) to put up matching funds and our issuing 3,000,000 shares of its common stock to members of OIALP.
Acquisition of a Controlling Interest in Browning Productions & Entertainment, Inc.
 
On October 22, 2018, we entered into an Exchange Agreement (“Browning Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which we acquired a majority of the outstanding shares (the “Controlling Interest in Browning”) of Browning Productions & Entertainment, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Browning Productions”), from William J. Browning, the sole stockholder of Browning. Browning Productions produces television programs which have aired internationally as well as nationally.
 
In exchange for the controlling interest in Browning Productions, we paid Mr. Browning $10,000 and issued to him 150,000 shares of common stock, and agreed to issue to him an additional 150,000 shares of common stock following completion of the audit of Browning Productions’ financial statements, plus an additional number of shares of common stock which can be up to a maximum of 17,000,000 shares, determined by dividing two and a half times the net after tax earnings of Browning Productions during the twelve month period ending December 31, 2019 by the average of the closing price of our common stock during the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the end of 2019. To the extent the number of shares which we are obligated to issue to Mr. Browning exceeds 13,553,506 shares, representing 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to the acquisition (the “Excess Shares”), instead of issuing the Excess Shares to Mr. Browning we will pay him an amount in cash for the Excess Shares. We had previously paid Mr. Browning $10,000 and issued 35,000 shares of common stock to him upon execution of a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of Browning Productions on May 10, 2018.
 
Though the terms of this transaction only required a $20,000 cash payment ($10,000 in cash under the non-binding letter of intent and $10,000 in cash under the Browning Exchange Agreement) to Mr. Browning, we were required to provide Browning Productions with a working capital loan in an initial amount of $150,000, which is to be repaid out of the post-closing net profit of Browning Productions as well as earmark an additional $150,000 in cash for future investment in Browning Productions (to assist in funding the future operations of Browning Productions).
 
We have agreed to register for resale the initial 150,000 shares issued to Mr. Browning.
 
We have a right of first refusal to purchase the remaining shares of Browning Productions.

Upon the closing of the Maham transaction, we will own 51% of the issued and outstanding interests in Maham.

Recent Developments
 
Disposition of a Controlling Interest in Banana Whale Studios Pte. Ltd.  
 
On February 4, 2019, we entered into and consummated an agreement (the “Agreement”) with Banana Whale and the Banana Whale Stockholders, pursuant to which we sold the Controlling Interest in Banana Whale in exchange for $2,000,000, consisting of $1,500,000 in cash and a $500,000 promissory note bearing interest at 5% per annum payable on December 31, 2019 (the “BWS Note”). Under the BWS Note, Banana Whale can prepay the BWS Note in whole or in part without premium or penalty. Pursuant to the BWS Note, the Banana Whale Stockholders agreed to guarantee the payments of all amounts due thereunder on a limited-recourse basis. On February 4, 2019, we also entered into a Pledge and Escrow Agreement with the Banana Whale Stockholders pursuant to which the Banana Whale Stockholders agreed to place the Controlling Interest in Banana Whale in escrow as security for payment of the BWS Note.
 
The Agreement also terminated certain of the remaining obligations under the Exchange Agreement which was previously entered into by us and the Banana Whale Stockholders, releasing us, Banana Whale and the Banana Whale Stockholders from their remaining obligations thereunder. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we had agreed to acquire the Controlling Interest in Banana Whale in exchange for a number of our shares to be based upon the earnings of Banana Whale. Under the Agreement, the Company agreed to leave the OHGI Shares in escrow and together with the Banana Whale Stockholders, to instruct the escrow agent that the OHGI Shares will remain in escrow for a period of at least 90 days pending an absence of asserted claims under the Agreements indemnification provisions.
 
Recent Voluntary Termination By OHGI of Listing of Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market
 
Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) on July 9, 2014 under the ticker symbol “OHGI”. On May 10, 2018, the Company received notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq indicating that the Company’s common stock did not meet the continued listing requirement as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based on the closing bid price of the common stock for the preceding 30 business days.
 
 11

 

Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company received a 180-calendar day grace period from the date of the Notice to regain compliance by meeting the continued listing standard of a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day grace period ended on November 6, 2018. During the grace period, the Company was unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price standard.
 
In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), in addition to such initial grace period, the Company could be afforded an additional 180-calendar day compliance period, provided that on the 180th calendar day of the initial grace period, the Company (i) met the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq (except for the bid price requirement) and (ii) notified Nasdaq of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency. Prior to expiration of the initial grace period, the Company requested an additional 180-calendar day compliance period and notified Nasdaq of the Company’s compliance with the stated listing standards and its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency through a reverse stock split, if necessary. On November 7, 2018, the Company received written notification from Nasdaq granting an additional 180-calendar day period, which expires on May 6, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement described above. This second 180-calendar day period relates exclusively to the bid price deficiency and we could be delisted during the 180-calendar day period for failure to maintain compliance with any other listing requirements that occurs during the 180-calendar day period.
 
During subsequent interactions between the Company and the Nasdaq it became apparent that the Nasdaq may make a finding of noncompliance with the stockholder approval requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 and may initiate delisting proceedings against the Company.
 
As a result of the foregoing, on February 26, 2019, Martin Ward, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, approved the voluntary termination of the listing of OHGI’s common stock on the Nasdaq. On March 8, 2019, the Company filed an application on Form 25 with the SEC to voluntarily terminate its Nasdaq listing. The delisting from the Nasdaq became effective on March 8, 2019. As of March 8, 2019, the Company’s common stock is quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets under the ticker symbol “OHGI.” The transition from the Nasdaq to the OTCQB did not materially affect the Company’s business operations.
 
Reverse Stock Split 
 
A reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”) of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock in the range from one-for-two (1-for-2) to one-for-fifty (1-for-50), which ratio will be selected by the Board of Directors was approved by our Board of Directors and by our shareholders at the annual meeting of the shareholders held on December 27, 2018 as described in that proxy statement on that certain Definitive Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on November 28, 2018. We will announce publicly our plans to effect the Reverse Stock Split once the Board of Directors makes its determination.
