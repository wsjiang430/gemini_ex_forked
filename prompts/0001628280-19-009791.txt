Item 1. | Business

Corporate Overview
Landec Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Landec” or the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture and sell differentiated health and wellness products for food and biomaterials markets. There continues to be a dramatic shift in consumer behavior to healthier eating habits and preventive wellness to improve quality of life. In our Curation Foods, Inc. business (formerly known as Apio, Inc., see below for further discussion on the renaming of our natural foods business), we are committed to offering healthy, fresh produce products conveniently packaged to consumers. In our Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (“Lifecore”) biomaterials business, we commercialize products that enable people to stay more active as they grow older.
Landec’s Curation Foods and Lifecore businesses utilize polymer chemistry technology, a key differentiating factor. Both businesses focus on business-to-business selling such as selling directly to retail grocery store chains and club stores for Curation Foods and directly to partners in the medical device and pharmaceutical markets for Lifecore.
With the discontinuation of the Food Export business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Landec has three reportable business segments – Curation Foods and Lifecore, each of which is described below, and an Other segment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Company discontinued its Now Planting® business. The operating results for the Food Export and Now Planting businesses are presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the financial results for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.
Curation Foods
On January 11, 2019, the Company marked the completion of its transition from a packaged fresh vegetables company to a branded, natural foods company by changing the name of its food business from Apio, Inc (“Apio”) to Curation Foods, Inc. Curation Foods will serve as the corporate umbrella for a portfolio of four natural food brands, including the Company’s flagship brand Eat Smart® as well as its three emerging natural foods brands, O Olive Oil & Vinegar® ("O") products, and Yucatan® and Cabo Fresh® authentic guacamole and avocado products that were acquired by the Company through the acquisition of Yucatan Foods, Inc. on December 1, 2018. 
The Company sells specialty packaged Eat Smart branded salads and private label fresh-cut vegetables and whole produce to retailers, club stores, and food service operators, primarily in the United States and Canada. The Company also sells premier California specialty O olive oils and wine vinegars to natural food, conventional grocery and mass retail stores primarily in the United States and Canada. The majority of Yucatan and Cabo Fresh guacamole and avocado food products are sold in the U.S. grocery channel, but they are also sold in U.S. mass retail, Canadian grocery retail and foodservice channels.
The Eat Smart brand combines our proprietary BreatheWay® food packaging technology with the capabilities of a large national food supplier and value-added produce processor to foodservice operators, as well as under private labels. Within the Eat Smart brand, produce is processed by trimming, washing, sorting, blending, and packaging into bags and trays that in most cases incorporate Landec’s BreatheWay membrane technology. The BreatheWay membrane increases shelf-life and reduces shrink (waste) for retailers and helps to ensure that consumers receive fresh produce by the time the product makes its way through the distribution chain. Curation Foods also generates revenue from the sale and/or use of its BreatheWay technology by partners such as Windset Holding 2010 Ltd., a Canadian corporation (“Windset”), for packaging of greenhouse grown cucumbers and peppers.

Lifecore
Lifecore operates our biomaterials business and is involved in the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate (“HA”) products and providing contract development and aseptic manufacturing services. Sodium hyaluronate is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix in animals and humans. Based upon Lifecore’s expertise working with highly viscous HA, the Company specializes in fermentation and aseptic formulation, filling, and packaging services, as a contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”), for difficult to handle (viscous) materials filled in finished dose vials and syringes.
Landec was incorporated in California on October 31, 1986 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 6, 2008. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “LNDC”. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 5201 Great America Parkway, Suite 232, Santa Clara, California 95054, and the telephone number is (650) 306-1650.
Description of Core Business
Landec operates its business in three reportable business segments: Curation Foods, Lifecore, and Other.
Curation Foods

The Curation Foods business is comprised of Curation Foods' packaged fresh vegetables business sold primarily under the Eat Smart brand, O branded olive oils and wine vinegars, and Yucatan and Cabo Fresh guacamole and avocado food products. 
Eat Smart Packaged Fresh Vegetables
Based in Santa Maria, California, Curation Foods’ primary business is the processing, marketing and selling of vegetable-based salads and fresh-cut and whole vegetable products primarily packaged in its proprietary BreatheWay packaging. The packaged fresh vegetables business markets a variety of salads and fresh-cut and whole vegetables to the top retail grocery chains, club stores, and food service operators.
There are four major distinguishing characteristics of Curation Foods that provide competitive advantages in the Company's Eat Smart packaged fresh vegetables market:
Packaged Salads and Vegetables Supplier: Curation Foods has structured its packaged fresh vegetables business as a marketer and seller of branded and private label blended, salads and fresh-cut and whole vegetable products. It is focused on selling products primarily under its Eat Smart brand and private label brands. As retail grocery chains, club stores and food service operators consolidate, Curation Foods is well positioned as a single source of a broad range of products.
Nationwide Processing and Distribution: Curation Foods has strategically invested in its salads and fresh-cut vegetables business. Curation Foods’ largest processing plant is in Guadalupe, CA, and is automated with state-of-the-art vegetable processing equipment in one of the lower cost, growing regions in California, the Santa Maria Valley. Curation Foods also has three East Coast processing facilities and five East Coast distribution centers for nationwide delivery of all of its packaged salads and vegetable products in order to meet the next-day delivery needs of customers.
Expanded Product Line Using Technology and Unique Blends: Curation Foods is introducing new salads and packaged vegetable products each year, and many of these products use our BreatheWay packaging technology to extend shelf-life. These new product offerings range from various sizes of fresh-cut bagged products, to vegetable trays, to whole produce, to vegetable salads and to snack packs. During the last twelve months, Curation Foods introduced twenty new unique products.
Products Currently in Approximately 67% of North American Retail Grocery Stores: Curation Foods' packaged fresh vegetables business has products in approximately 67% of all North American retail grocery stores. This gives Curation Foods the opportunity to sell new products to existing customers and to increase distribution of its approximately 120 unique packaged fresh vegetable products within those customers.

Most vegetable products packaged in the Company’s BreatheWay packaging have a shelf-life of approximately 17 days. In addition to packaging innovation, the Company has developed innovative blends and combinations of vegetables that are sold in flexible film bags or rigid trays. The Company has launched a family of salad kits that are comprised of “superfood” mixtures of vegetables with healthy toppings and dressings. The first salad kit to launch under the Eat Smart brand was Sweet Kale Salad, which now has significant distribution throughout club and retail stores in North America. Additionally, we have launched under the Eat Smart brand several other superfood salad kits including Chopped and Crumble™ salads, Southwest Salad, and Asian Sesame Salad to name a few and, more recently, a line of single-serve salads under our Salad Shake-Ups!™ brand. The Company’s expertise includes accessing leading culinary experts and nutritionists nationally to help in the new product development process. We believe that the Company’s new products are “on trend” and strong market acceptance supports this belief. Recent statistics show that more than two-thirds of adults are considered to be overweight or obese. More and more consumers are beginning to make better food choices in their schools, homes, and in restaurants and that is where our Eat Smart products can fit into consumers’ daily healthy food choices.
The Company also periodically licenses its BreatheWay packaging technology to partners for packaging fruits and vegetables, and Windset for packaging peppers and cucumbers that are grown hydroponically in greenhouses. These packaging license relationships generate revenues either from product sales or royalties once commercialized. The Company is engaged in the testing and development of other BreatheWay products. Landec manufactures its BreatheWay packaging through selected qualified contract manufacturers.
Windset
The Company believes that hydroponically-grown produce using Windset’s know-how and growing practices will result in higher yields with competitive growing costs that will provide dependable year-round supply to Windset’s customers. In addition, the produce grown in Windset’s greenhouses uses significantly less water than field grown crops and has a very high safety profile as no soil is used in the growing process. Windset owns and operates greenhouses in British Columbia, Canada and California. In addition to growing produce in its own greenhouses, Windset has numerous marketing arrangements with other greenhouse growers and utilizes buy/sell arrangements to meet fluctuation in demand from their customers.
O Olive Oils & Vinegars
The Company acquired O on March 1, 2017. O, founded in 1995, is based in Petaluma, California, and is the premier producer of California specialty olive oils and wine vinegars. Its products are sold in natural food, conventional grocery and mass retail stores, primarily in the United States and Canada.
Yucatan and Cabo Fresh
The Company acquired Yucatan Foods on December 1, 2018. Yucatan Foods, founded in 1991, is based in Los Angeles, California. As part of the acquisition of Yucatan Foods, Curation Foods acquired the newly built production facility in Guanajuato, Mexico. The Yucatan Foods business adds another double-digit growth platform, a lower-cost infrastructure in Mexico, and higher margin product offerings that generally exhibit less sourcing volatility.
Lifecore
Lifecore is involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate in bulk form as well as formulated and filled syringes and vials for injectable products used in treating a broad spectrum of medical conditions and procedures. Lifecore leverages its fermentation process to manufacture premium, pharmaceutical-grade HA and uses its aseptic filling capabilities to deliver private-label HA and non-HA finished products to its customers. 
Lifecore provides product development services to its partners for HA-based, as well as non-HA based, aseptically formulated and filled products. These services include activities such as technology transfer, material component changes, analytical method development, formulation development, pilot studies, stability studies, process validation, and production of materials for clinical studies.
Lifecore uses its fermentation process and aseptic formulation and filling expertise to be a leader in the development of HA-based products for multiple applications and to take advantage of non-HA device and drug opportunities which leverage its expertise in manufacturing and aseptic syringe filling capabilities. Elements of Lifecore’s strategy include the following:
-3-

Establish strategic relationships with market leaders: Lifecore will continue to develop applications for products with partners who have strong marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities to end-user markets. Through its strong reputation and history of providing pharmaceutical grade HA and products, Lifecore has been able to establish long-term relationships with the market leading ophthalmic surgical companies, and leverages those partnerships to attract new relationships in other medical markets.
Expand medical applications for HA: Due to the growing knowledge of the unique characteristics of HA, and the role it plays in normal physiology, Lifecore continues to identify and pursue opportunities for the use of HA in other medical applications, such as wound care, aesthetic surgery, drug delivery, next generation orthopedics and device coatings, and through sales to academic and corporate research customers. Further applications may involve expanding process development activity and/or additional licensing of technology.
Utilize manufacturing infrastructure to pursue contract aseptic filling and fermentation opportunities: Lifecore has made strategic capital investments in its CDMO business focusing on extending its aseptic filling capacity and capabilities. It is investing in this segment to meet increasing partner demand and attract new contract filling opportunities outside of HA markets. Lifecore is using its manufacturing capabilities to provide contract manufacturing and development services to its partners in the area of sterile pre-filled syringes and vials, as well as, fermentation and purification requirements.
Maintain flexibility in product development and supply relationships: Lifecore’s vertically integrated development and manufacturing capabilities allow it to establish a variety of contractual relationships with global corporate partners. Lifecore’s role in these relationships extends from supplying HA raw materials to providing technology transfer and development services to manufacturing aseptically filled, finished sterile products, and assuming full supply chain responsibilities.
Other
Included in the Other segment is Corporate, which includes corporate general and administrative expenses, non-Curation Foods and non-Lifecore interest income and income tax expenses.
Technology Overview
The Company has two proprietary polymer technology platforms: (1) Intelimer® materials, which are the key technology behind our BreatheWay membrane technology, and (2) hyaluronan biopolymers. The Company’s materials are generally proprietary as a result of being patented or being specially formulated for specific customers to meet specific commercial applications and/or specific regulatory requirements. The Company’s polymer technologies, customer relationships, trade names and strong channels of distribution are the foundation and key differentiating advantages on which Landec has built its business.
Intelimer Polymers
Intelimer polymers are crystalline, hydrophobic polymers that use a temperature switch to control and modulate properties such as viscosity, permeability and adhesion when varying the materials’ temperature above and below the temperature switch. The sharp temperature switch is adjustable at relatively low temperatures (0°C to 100°C) and the changes resulting from the temperature switch are relatively easy to maintain in industrial and commercial environments. For instance, Intelimer polymers can change within the range of one or two degrees Celsius from a non-adhesive state to a highly tacky, adhesive state; from an impermeable state to a highly permeable state; or from a solid state to a viscous liquid state.
Landec's proprietary polymer technology is based on the structure and phase behavior of Intelimer materials. The abrupt thermal transitions of specific Intelimer materials are achieved through the controlled use of hydrocarbon side chains that are attached to a polymer backbone. Below a pre-determined switch temperature, the polymer's side chains align through weak hydrophobic interactions resulting in a crystalline structure. When this side chain crystallizable polymer is heated to, or above, this switch temperature, these interactions are disrupted and the polymer is transformed into an amorphous, viscous state. Because this transformation involves a physical and not a chemical change, this process can be repeatedly reversible. Landec can set the polymer switch temperature anywhere between 0°C to 100°C by varying the average length of the side chains.

Landec's Intelimer materials are readily available and are generally synthesized from long side-chain acrylic monomers that are derived primarily from natural materials such as coconut and palm oils that are highly purified and designed to be manufactured economically through known synthetic processes. These acrylic-monomer raw materials are then polymerized by Landec leading to many different side-chain crystallizable polymers whose properties vary depending upon the initial materials and the synthetic process. Intelimer materials can be made into many different forms, including films, coatings, microcapsules and discrete forms. Intelimer polymers are the coatings on the substrate used to form our BreatheWay membranes.
BreatheWay Membrane Packaging 
Certain types of fresh-cut and whole produce can spoil or discolor rapidly when packaged in conventional packaging materials and, therefore, are limited in their ability to be distributed broadly to markets. The Company’s proprietary BreatheWay packaging technology utilizes Landec’s Intelimer polymer technology to naturally extend the shelf-life and quality of fresh-cut and whole produce.
After harvesting, vegetables and fruit continue to respire, consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Too much or too little oxygen can result in premature spoilage and decay. The respiration rate of produce varies for each fruit and vegetable. Conventional packaging films used today, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, can be made with modest permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, but often do not provide the optimal atmosphere for the packaged produce. To achieve optimal product performance, each fruit or vegetable requires its own unique package atmosphere conditions. The challenge facing the industry is to develop packaging that meets the highly variable needs that each product requires in order to achieve value-creating performance. The Company believes that its BreatheWay packaging technology possesses all of the critical functionalities required to serve this diverse market. In creating a product package, a BreatheWay membrane is applied over a small cutout section or an aperture of a flexible film bag or plastic tray. This highly permeable “window” acts as the mechanism to provide the majority of the gas transmission requirements for the entire package. These membranes are designed to provide three principal benefits:
High Permeability: Landec's BreatheWay packaging technology is designed to permit transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide at 300 to 1,000 times the rate of conventional packaging films. The Company believes that these higher permeability levels will facilitate the packaging diversity required to market many types of fresh-cut and whole produce in many package sizes and configurations.
Ability to Adjust Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Ratios: BreatheWay packaging can be tailored with carbon dioxide to oxygen transfer ratios ranging from 1.0 to 12.0 to selectively transmit oxygen and carbon dioxide at optimum rates to sustain the quality and shelf-life of packaged produce. Other high permeability packaging materials, such as micro-perforated films cannot differentially control carbon dioxide permeability, resulting in sub-optimal package atmosphere conditions for many produce products.
Temperature Responsiveness: Landec has developed breathable membranes that can be designed to increase or decrease permeability in response to environmental temperature changes. The Company has developed packaging that responds to higher oxygen requirements at elevated temperatures, but is also reversible, and returns to its original state as temperatures decline. As the respiration rate of fresh produce also increases with temperature, the BreatheWay membrane’s temperature responsiveness allows packages to compensate for the change in produce respiration by automatically adjusting gas permeation rates. By doing so, detrimental package atmosphere conditions are avoided and improved quality is maintained through the distribution chain.
Sodium Hyaluronate (HA)
Sodium hyaluronate is a non-crystalline, hydrophilic polymer that exists naturally as part of the extracellular matrix in many tissues within the human body, most notably within the aqueous humor of the eye, synovial fluid, skin and umbilical cord. The viscoelastic properties and water solubility of HA make it ideal for medical applications where space maintenance, lubricity, drug delivery or tissue protection are critical. Because of its widespread presence in tissues, its critical role in normal physiology, and its high degree of biocompatibility, the Company believes that hyaluronan will continue to be used in existing applications and for an increasing variety of other medical applications.
Sodium hyaluronate was first demonstrated to have commercial medical utility as a viscoelastic solution in cataract surgery. In this application, it is used for maintaining the space in the anterior chamber and protecting corneal tissue during the removal and implantation of intraocular lenses. HA-based products have gained widespread acceptance in ophthalmology and are currently used in the majority of cataract extraction procedures in the world. HA has also become a significant component in several products used in orthopedics. Lifecore’s HA is used as a viscous carrier for allogeneic freeze-dried demineralized bone used in spinal surgery, and as the active component of devices to treat the symptoms of osteoarthritis, and as a component to provide increased lubricity to medical devices. Lifecore’s HA has also been utilized in veterinary drug applications to treat traumatic arthritis.

Sales and Marketing
Curation Foods is supported by dedicated sales and marketing resources located in central California and throughout the U.S. and Canada.
Lifecore sells products to partners under supply agreements and also through distribution agreements. Excluding research sales, Lifecore does not sell to end users and, therefore, does not have the traditional infrastructure of a dedicated sales force and marketing employees. It is Lifecore’s name recognition and referrals that allow Lifecore it to attract new customers and offer its services with a minimal marketing and sales infrastructure.
Seasonality
Curation Foods' can be affected by seasonal weather factors, which can result in higher costs of sourcing product due to a shortage of essential produce items. Lifecore is not significantly affected by seasonality.
Manufacturing and Processing
Curation Foods
Eat Smart Packaged Fresh Vegetables
Packaged fresh vegetable products and fresh-cut packaged green beans are processed in the Company's facilities located in Guadalupe, California; Bowling Green, Ohio; Hanover, Pennsylvania; and Vero Beach, Florida. Cooling of produce is done through third parties and its own in-house cooling through its various cooling systems.
BreatheWay packaging products are comprised of polymer manufacturing, membrane manufacturing, and label package conversion. Contract manufacturers currently make virtually all of the polymers for the BreatheWay packaging system and breathable membranes. The Company performs the label package conversion in its various processing facilities.
O Olive Oils & Vinegars
O uses third parties to crush, process, and bottle its olive oil products, primarily within California. The fermentation, production, and processing of vinegar is performed at the Company's facility in Petaluma, California, using ingredients sourced from various third parties primarily within California. O uses third parties in California to bottle its vinegar products.
Yucatan and Cabo Fresh
Guacamole for the Yucatan and Cabo Fresh brands is primarily produced and packed at the Company's facility in Guanajuato, Mexico, using ingredients sourced from various third parties within the United States and Mexico.
Lifecore
The commercial production of HA requires fermentation, separation, and purification and aseptic processing capabilities. HA can primarily be produced in two ways, either through bacterial fermentation or through extraction from rooster combs. Lifecore produces HA only from fermentation, using an extremely efficient microbial fermentation process and a highly effective purification operation.
Lifecore’s facilities in Chaska, Minnesota are used primarily for the HA and non-HA manufacturing process, formulation, aseptic syringe and vial filling, analytical services, secondary packaging, warehousing raw materials and finished goods, and distribution. Lifecore provides versatility in the manufacturing of various types of finished products and supplies several different forms of HA and non-HA products in a variety of molecular weight fractions as powders, solutions and gels, and in a variety of bulk and single-use finished packages. The Company believes that its current manufacturing capacity plan will be sufficient to allow it to meet the needs of its current customers for the foreseeable future.
