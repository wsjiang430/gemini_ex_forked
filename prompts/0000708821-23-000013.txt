We have been an approved provider of restaurant technology systems and related support services to McDonald’s Corporation and their franchisees since 1980 and an approved supplier to Yum! Brands, Inc. since 1983.
Competition
The markets for our products and services are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. We compete on the basis of features and functionality, user experience, integration capabilities, method of delivery (cloud versus traditional on-premise software applications), existing and planned product design, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price, and customer service. Most of our larger customers have several approved suppliers of software and hardware similar to one or more of our products.
Our competitive advantages include: our unified experience product and service offerings, open integration platform, cloud delivery model based on modern architecture, enterprise grade solutions, purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a direct sales team, and responsive customer service and support. 
While we believe we compete favorably, we expect competition in the restaurant and retail markets to continue, including aggressive pricing, increased introductions of new products and services, and technological advancements by competitors. We face competition from companies who have greater financial and technical resources, more relevant product and service offerings, and larger established customer bases. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new market entrants, including smaller emerging companies that could introduce new product and service offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.
Supply
We have agreements for the supply of hardware products and components, including long-term or volume-based purchase agreements with some suppliers, and we have identified alternative sources in the event one or more of our suppliers are not able to perform or fully perform; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to timely secure alternative product or components or continue our current supplier agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Many of the products and components used by us are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations; additionally, we have experienced a shortage in the number of suppliers and those suppliers' availability of certain products and components, for example, certain batteries, chipsets, or hardware devices, which can also result in significant price fluctuations. To mitigate these risks, we do from time to time increase our inventory levels of scarce products and components and adjust our pricing, while maintaining competitive pricing, to properly reflect market conditions.
Research and Development
Continuous product research, innovation, and product development are an integral part of our business. We continuously evaluate customer needs and new technologies to enable us to develop innovative and relevant products, in addition to creating enhancements to our unified experience service and product offerings and existing products that improve and/or add to their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities. Research and development expenses were $48.6 million, $34.6 million, and $19.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

PAR Government has strong and enduring relationships with a diverse set of customers throughout the DoD, IC, and other federal agencies. Our track record of delivering mission critical services to government customers spans decades, and includes contracts continuing 20 years or more, with an average contract duration of three to five years. We work closely with our customers, with many of our MS group employees co-located at customer sites. Our strong relationships and on-site presence with our customers enables PAR Government to develop substantive customer and technical domain knowledge, translate mission understanding into exemplary program execution, and create continued demand for PAR Government’s services.
Commercial Software
PAR Government’s commercial software business draws on decades of research and development (“R&D”), image processing and geospatial information systems ("GIS") experience. Licensable software products focus on serving analysts and operators who seek highly accurate and timely information with both temporal and geospatial context. Product utility spans the modern battlefield from rear echelon analyst cell to the field operations center to the mobile devices and displays carried by infantryman at the very forward edge of a battlespace. Currently we offer two types of software products. The geospatial visualization ("GV") image processing suite is used by the international defense and intelligence community to analyze still and video imagery. A second product line, Situation-X (“Sit-X”), provides cloud-native interconnectivity for mobile platform situational awareness solutions used by government and private organizations to manage rapid response teams or deployed field units. Customers include global geospatial software providers, NATO partners, public safety organizations, and select U.S. intelligence agencies.
Markets and Competition
PAR Government obtains contracts through a mix of competitive proposals and technical paper submissions in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, we obtain contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals against publicly identified government requirements which are selected on merit for further development and funding. Although well positioned in our markets, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of our competitors are large corporations that have substantially greater financial resources and broader capabilities in management technology. Within our ISR contract portfolio we compete based on the technical talent and accomplishments of our development staff, approach to software development, and program management teams who have earned a reputation for rapid solutioning of leading edge software solutions. We differentiate our ISR offerings based on our demonstrated technical savvy and key staff, who have high security clearances and the background and appetite to tackle truly difficult problems.
In our MS contract portfolio, we compete with many smaller, economically disadvantaged companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential, set aside, treatment that target segments of the government contract market. Here the principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities, and service. Many of our DoD customers are migrating to price sensitive, best value procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions. We differentiate our MS offerings based on our strong past performance, having performed exceedingly well for several decades, and competitive pricing strategies.
We continue to evolve our commercial software offerings through dedicated investments in two main areas. First, we are developing video streaming and replication technologies to enable unmanned aerial vehicle operators to share video outputs across their entire team in real time. Second, we are developing capabilities for tactical edge mobile device users to search and retrieve available satellite data from the growing commercial space-based remote sensing markets. 
Our strategy is to build upon PAR Government segment's sustained performance on existing service contracts, coupled with investments in enhanced business development capabilities. We believe we are well positioned to realize continued renewals of expiring contracts and extensions of existing contracts, and to secure service and solution contracts in expanded areas within the DoD and other federal agencies. We believe our highly relevant technical competencies, intellectual property, and investments in new technologies provide opportunities to offer systems integration, products, and highly specialized service solutions to the DoD, IC, and other federal agencies. The general technology investment areas by agency, procurement cycles, and spending levels for the next several years are factors we monitor as we develop and implement our business strategy for our Government segment.
Intellectual Property
We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property. We have U.S. and foreign patents filed and issued to protect our discoveries and inventions, registered and common law trademarks to protect our brand, and copyrights that relate to software and various distinctive characteristics of our products. We also rely on a combination of confidentiality and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees and consultants, and enter into confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers and other third parties with whom we have strategic 
relationships. We believe our use and reliance on intellectual property laws and our agreements and licenses protect and maintain our rights in our intellectual property; however, there can be no assurance that our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights in technologies that are relevant to our business; or that our intellectual property rights will give us a competitive advantage. For a discussion of risks associated with intellectual property, refer to the Risk Factor—"Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows" in "Part I, Item 1A.

All PAR employees are mandated to complete annual security awareness training and participate in additional security related training on a regular basis, and the audit committee of our board of directors is provided quarterly reports on PAR’s cybersecurity program.
Human Capital 
We prioritize finding, developing and rewarding extraordinary talent. Our employee-first strategy is designed to provide a diverse, inclusive and safe environment where our employees enjoy coming to work each day to support our customers and grow our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,719 full-time employees and 36 part-time employees.
We value speed, ownership, focus and winning together, which we consider to be the foundation for how we operate and make decisions.
Leadership's Role: Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses. Our mission is to create an environment that reflects our values of speed, ownership, focus and winning together where our employees thrive. Our strategy is to seek to hire the best talent, give them the 
responsibility and authority they deserve, and let them make the decisions on how to best execute. We design our employee compensation and benefits programs to be competitive, reinforce our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), and consistent with our values, to incentivize and reward outstanding performance. Our Chief Executive Officer and Sr. Vice President, Human Resources regularly update the compensation committee of our board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Our commitment to DEI is simple: it’s about community and belonging. We aim to represent the diversity we see in all our customers and their communities. We want to understand and integrate our employee’s unique perspectives and voices every day. Our employees should feel a sense of belonging and want to be part of the PAR team.
We continued to make significant investments in our DEI program in 2022, including the expansion of our DEI team, launching Company wide DEI training, expanding our employee resource group footprint to foster an inclusive workplace that aligns with our values, and launching additional employee surveys to better understand the diversity of our employee population to inform our strategy. We are excited to have launched our first external DEI website and we continue to make investments in our DEI initiatives in 2023.
To evaluate and assess the effectiveness of our DEI program, we track the ethnic and gender diversity of our U.S. employee population and gender diversity of our global employee population. Our U.S. employee population consists of 28% ethnically diverse employees and 27% women. Globally, our workforce consists of 25% women. 
Employee Engagement and Talent Management/Development: Consistent with our employee-first strategy, we believe that our employees should have the opportunity to have a forum to communicate their feedback, concerns and suggestions. We conduct semi-annual employee net promoter engagement surveys. Understanding the “pulse” of our employees through engagement surveys is critical to inform our actions with respect to integrating areas of opportunity in our employee engagement, retention and total rewards programs.
Our compensation philosophy aims to attract, retain and incentivize top performers in a highly competitive market for talent, who can deliver competitive financial returns to shareholders through the achievement of short-term and long-term performance targets. To support our meritocratic, pay-for-performance strategy, we execute annual performance and 360 performance reviews with the intent to incentivize and motivate our employees. Talent assessments enable us to identify individuals that are ready for promotion and areas of development across our core competencies. In 2022, we invested in refining our talent management systems and in 2023 are expanding our talent development platform to increase our investment in the core competency development for all of our employees.
Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees in the workplace is of utmost importance to us. We regularly assess our facilities to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. 
Talent Acquisition and Attrition: PAR works diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources to meet the current and future demands of our business. To proactively attract diverse talent, we engage with universities, professional associations, and industry groups, and we leverage PAR’s robust employee value proposition, which includes our location-flexible philosophy, a collaborative global work environment, and a shared sense of purpose. Our focus on retaining talent is rooted in our employee-first strategy and includes investments in employee engagement, diverse talent sourcing tools, talent management systems, and development. We continue to make appropriate adjustments to ensure competitive compensation, including the implementation of a pay transparency initiative to ensure equity and fairness.
