 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of specialty products that target markets with underserved patient populations. We generate total revenues across our existing portfolio of promoted specialty neurology and women’s health products, as well as our non‑promoted products, which are primarily complex formulations of generic drugs. In July 2017, we received regulatory approval from the FDA, for M‑72 (methylphenidate hydrochloride extended‑release tablets, 72 mg) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, in patients aged 13 to 65 and launched M-72 in the second quarter of 2018.  In February 2018, we received FDA approval of Osmolex ER™ (amantadine extended‑release tablets) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and drug‑induced extrapyramidal reactions, which are involuntary muscle movements caused by certain medications, in adults and completed commercial launch of Osmolex ER in January 2019. In addition, we have a late‑stage development pipeline highlighted by two new drug application, or NDA, candidates in Phase III clinical trials: Ontinua™ ER (arbaclofen extended‑release tablets) for muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients and RVL‑1201 (oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.1%) for the treatment of blepharoptosis, or droopy eyelid. Many of our products use our proprietary osmotic‑release drug delivery system, Osmodex®, which we believe offers advantages over alternative extended‑release, or ER, technologies.
 Our core competencies span drug development, manufacturing and commercialization. Our specialized neurology and women’s health sales teams support the ongoing commercialization of our existing promoted product portfolio as well as the launch of new products. As of December 31, 2018, we actively promoted five products: M‑72, Lorzone® (chlorzoxazone scored tablets) and ConZip® (tramadol hydrochloride extended‑release capsules) in specialty neurology; and OB Complete®, our family of prescription prenatal dietary supplements, and Divigel® (estradiol gel, 0.1%) in

women’s health. We launched M‑72 in the second quarter of 2018, and completed the launch of Osmolex ER, in January, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we sold a portfolio consisting of approximately 37 non‑promoted products.  The cash flow from these non‑promoted products has contributed to our investments in research and development and business development activities. Many of our existing products benefit from several potential barriers to entry, including intellectual property protection, formulation and manufacturing complexities, data exclusivity, as well as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, regulation and quotas for active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API. Certain of our key products, particularly those that incorporate our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system, are or are expected to be manufactured in our Marietta, Georgia facility.
 We are focused on progressing our pipeline, which is highlighted by two Phase III candidates under clinical development — arbaclofen ER and RVL‑1201. We developed arbaclofen ER using our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system and believe this formulation will provide an efficacious and safe treatment for spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients. Arbaclofen ER has been designated by the FDA as an Orphan Drug in this indication. We recently received topline data from our second Phase III clinical trial of arbaclofen in multiple sclerosis patients with spasticity. The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study in which treatment groups received either placebo, 40 mg arbaclofen per day or 80 mg arbaclofen per day. The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in Total Numeric-transformed Ashworth Scale, or TNmAS, and Clinician Global Impression of Change, or CGIC, on day 84. Arbaclofen did not demonstrate superiority to placebo as measured by the CGIC; however, a statistically significant improvement in spasticity relative to placebo was demonstrated by the TNmAS for both doses of arbaclofen (p=0.0482 and 0.0118) for 40 mg and 80 mg per day, respectively.  Upon preliminary review, it appears that CGIC failed to recognize the improvement demonstrated by the TNmAS. However, the CGIC values indicated both treatment groups improved from baseline. Further, it appears that there is a dose-response relationship between the two strengths with the 80 mg exhibiting a stronger signal of efficacy as assessed by the TNmAS scale.  Though arbaclofen 80 mg per day had a higher discontinuation rate in the study, the safety and tolerability profile was in line with previously reported results, most notably a somnolence incidence of 9.5% and 14.5% for the 40-mg and 80-mg treatment arms, respectively, compared to 9.6% for the placebo treatment arm. Somnolence is one of the most frequently reported dose-limiting adverse events associated with baclofen treatment today. Based on the efficacy and safety exhibited for arbaclofen, the Company remains encouraged and plans to proceed with its clinical and regulatory strategy to file an NDA. At this time, however, it is unclear whether or not the Company will be required to conduct an additional clinical trial which may delay our submission past 2019.  Additionally, we continue to explore opportunities for arbaclofen in other indications, such as opioid withdrawal symptoms.
 We acquired the rights to RVL‑1201 in 2017 and are conducting a second Phase III clinical trial of RVL‑1201 for droopy eyelid. If approved, RVL‑1201 would be the first non‑surgical treatment option approved by the FDA for droopy eyelid. We have completed enrollment in the Phase III clinical trials for RVL-1201 and we anticipate submitting an NDA for RVL-1201 in the second half of 2019.  We plan to invest selectively in expanding our product portfolio by leveraging both our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system to develop differentiated products as well as our management team’s operating experience to pursue external business development opportunities.
 Our Strengths
 We believe our principal competitive strengths include:
 Diversified Portfolio of Pharmaceutical Products. As of December 31, 2018, we sold an attractive and diversified portfolio of five promoted products and approximately 37 non-promoted products. Through our specialized sales teams we promote a portfolio of specialty neurology and women's health products that we believe are differentiated from competing products and provide meaningful benefits to patients due to their formulation or pharmacokinetic profiles. In addition, we believe that our promoted products are protected by a combination of patent protection, data exclusivity and our proprietary formulation and manufacturing know-how. Our key non-promoted products are comprised of complex formulations of generic drugs that incorporate our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system.
 Efficient Research and Development Organization Generating a Targeted Pipeline. We have a history of developing commercially successful pharmaceutical products. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 104 professionals with extensive regulatory and drug development experience in our research and development organization. As of December 

 
  5

 
31, 2018 we had 36 U.S. patents, 79 patents outside the United States and 28 pending patent applications, the last of which expires in 2037. Our pipeline is highlighted by two NDA candidates in Phase III clinical trials: Ontinua ER, which we are evaluating for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis, particularly for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus and muscular rigidity; and RVL-1201, which we are studying for the treatment of blepharoptosis.
 Demonstrated Commercialization Capabilities. We have built a robust infrastructure for the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products. As of December 31, 2018 our sales force was comprised of two dedicated teams that totaled 193 professionals targeting approximately 18,000 physicians across the specialty neurology and women's health therapeutic areas. Our non-promoted products are supported by a team with extensive experience commercializing generic products in attractive markets.
 Experience Driving Patient Access in Order to Facilitate Penetration of Key Markets. We support patients' access to our medications through careful research and a deep understanding of the changing reimbursement landscape. We have developed capabilities across the market access continuum underscored by successful payor contracting strategies and supplemental patient assistance programs. Patient access is central to the commercialization strategy for our recent and near-term product launches. We expect that our pricing of these products will facilitate strong managed-care coverage and reimbursement, which we believe will improve patient access to our products.
 Product Portfolio and Pipeline That Benefit from Multiple Potential Barriers to Entry. Many of our existing products benefit from several potential barriers to entry, including intellectual property protection, formulation and manufacturing complexities, data exclusivity, as well as DEA regulation and quotas for API. Our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system uses osmotic pressure to provide a controlled drug release and is adaptable to many different combinations of immediate-release, extended-release and controlled- or delayed-release formulations that contain one or more drugs. We seek to identify and develop drug candidates that are well-suited to our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system, which we believe can deliver a differentiated and favorable pharmacokinetic profile and may provide meaningful benefits to patients. We believe that third parties attempting to compete with our products that use our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system may face difficulties in developing a comparable product. Likewise, we believe that formulation complexities and manufacturing challenges may limit the number of viable competitors in the markets for our key generic products.
 Cash Flow from Existing Product Portfolio Enhances Research and Development Investment and Opportunistic Business Development Activities. Our current commercial success and historical cash flow generation allow us to invest in our pipeline to support the next stage of our growth. Additionally, we opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions and business development initiatives to augment our internal development pipeline.
 Experienced and Accomplished Management Team with a Proven Track Record. Our management team brings a wealth of experience navigating changes in the pharmaceutical industry and delivering financial success. Led by our Chief Executive Officer, Brian Markison, our management team possesses expertise in many areas of the pharmaceutical industry, including drug development, manufacturing, commercial operations and finance.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company by developing and commercializing drugs with significant market opportunities, meaningful potential barriers to entry and long product life cycles. Our strategy to achieve this goal is focused on the following:
 Target Specialty Therapeutic Markets. We intend to continue developing innovative products targeting specialty markets with underserved patient populations that we believe we can commercialize efficiently. We may expand into additional specialty markets where we believe there are attractive opportunities to use our expertise and proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system to develop and commercialize differentiated products.
 Grow Our Existing Product Sales. We plan to leverage our existing sales force to grow our promoted product portfolio including M-72 and Osmolex ER. We anticipate opportunistically expanding our sales force to support future growth 

 
  6

 
and focus on products, such as M-72 and Osmolex ER, where we believe there is an attractive market. We intend to support our non-promoted products through our national account team that manages relationships with major drug-buying consortia, pharmaceutical wholesalers and retailers in the United States.
 Successfully Develop Our Late-Stage Product Candidates. We are focused on advancing the development of our late-stage clinical programs to further diversify our revenue base and sustain our future growth. If successfully developed, we believe Ontinua ER represents an attractive product candidate with an addressable multiple sclerosis spasticity market of up to $3.5 billion in the United States. If successfully developed and approved, we believe that RVL-1201 would become the first pharmacological treatment for blepharoptosis in the United States and would represent an important therapy in the continuum of care for patients with mild or moderate blepharoptosis. Our research and development efforts also include activities related to seeking additional indications for Ontinua ER.
 Expand Our Pipeline by Leveraging Our Proprietary Technology to Develop Differentiated Products. We plan to expand our pipeline of product candidates through the application of our technology, research infrastructure and development expertise. Our research and development efforts are focused on identifying commercially viable products that are well suited to benefit from our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system. Our technology is designed to produce an extended-release formulation with a differentiated pharmacokinetic profile that we believe can, in certain circumstances, meaningfully improve upon the efficacy or side effect profiles of currently approved therapies. We plan to continue to apply our drug development criteria to make capital efficient investments in promising product candidates.
 Opportunistically Acquire or In-License Rights to Clinically Differentiated Products, Pipeline Candidates or Technologies. We seek to selectively acquire or in-license approved products and late-stage product candidates that complement our existing product portfolio, pipeline, technology or commercial infrastructure. Our management team has a history of successfully executing and integrating product and company acquisitions, which we believe positions us to capitalize on these opportunities.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development team leverages its expertise across a variety of scientific disciplines to formulate product candidates and advance programs through the drug development and approval process and post marketing studies. Scientific staff in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Wilmington, North Carolina, Bridgewater, New Jersey, Marietta, Georgia and Budapest, Hungary use their expertise in our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system, chemistry and material science to focus on identifying drug compounds for re‑formulation to either achieve new therapeutic attributes (e.g., extended release) or indications in the case of branded products, or to achieve bioequivalence in the case of generic products. Additionally, we perform early‑stage manufacturing and technology transfer engineering and evaluate any unique intellectual property arising from these activities. If we elect to progress a development candidate forward, scale‑up process engineering is performed at our manufacturing plant in Marietta, Georgia. We have capabilities in regulatory affairs, pharmaceutical science, analytical chemistry, preclinical studies, clinical trial design and operations, quality assurance and compliance, medical affairs and pharmacovigilance. We deploy these competencies to advance a product candidate through the drug development process, and develop data and intellectual property to improve our products, support commercialization and extend product life cycles.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 104 employees in our research and development department worldwide. Our staff of research scientists has expertise in the drug development process, from pre‑formulation studies and formulation development, to scale‑up and manufacturing. The clinical development and medical affairs team assumes product stewardship from pre‑clinical testing and first‑in‑human studies, Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials through to post‑marketing studies, risk management and pharmacovigilance activities. Our research and development team has extensive experience developing and coordinating clinical trial programs and communicating with the FDA throughout the process to ensure proper trial design and an efficient clinical and drug development process. Our team has a successful track record of developing products and receiving FDA approval for NDAs and abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs.

 Intellectual Property
 We have built and continue to develop our intellectual property portfolio for our products and product candidates. We rely on our substantial know‑how, technological innovation, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, other intellectual property and in‑licensing opportunities to maintain and develop our competitive position. We pursue patent protection in the United States and selected international markets. As of December 31, 2018, we had 36 U.S. patents, 79 patents outside the United States and 28 pending patent applications, the last of which expires in 2037. Our Technology
 Osmodex: Our Proprietary Drug Delivery System
 Our technology allows us to manufacture tablets with one or more active drugs, and in combinations of immediate-release, controlled-release, delayed-release and extended-release, or ER. We believe that our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system is well-suited to address certain limitations of existing therapies that have less than optimal efficacy or unfavorable side effect profiles as a result of formulation, pharmacokinetic profiles or other complexities. However, whether our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system will suitably be paired with a given API is not certain or predictable. Each successful pairing that we have achieved in the past was the result of rigorous research, development and innovation. With that approach, our research and development team has led the successful clinical development of approved NDAs incorporating our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system, including Allegra D® (pseudoephedrine and H1 antagonist), venlafaxine extended-release tablets (VERT), Khedezla® (desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets) and Osmolex ER.
 We believe that brands using osmotic extended-release technology can benefit from longer life cycles as compared to brands delivered in conventional extended-release dosage forms due to the complexities of mimicking extended-release profiles of products using osmotic technologies. Moreover, we believe there are only a limited number of competitors with experience using osmotic technology. Given these dynamics, we estimate, based on market research, that osmotic extended-release brands have generally retained higher market share following loss of exclusivity as compared to other ER brands. We further estimate that generic versions of osmotic extended-release brands have tended to exhibit greater price stability as compared to generic versions of other extended-release branded formulations, as pricing declines over time.
 Our Portfolio
 As of December 31, 2018, we sold a diverse portfolio consisting of five promoted products and approximately 37 non-promoted products, several of which incorporate our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system. We also have a development pipeline that is highlighted by two NDA candidates in Phase III clinical trials, one of which we believe has the potential for indication expansion over time. Our non-promoted product portfolio includes methylphenidate ER and VERT as well as smaller volume ANDAs and prescription dietary supplements. As of December 31, 2018 our non-promoted pipeline included 16 products in various stages of development.

 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We will continue to face competition from various global pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies that engage in drug development activities. Many of our competitors have similar products that focus on the same diseases and conditions that our current and future pipeline products address. Many of our competitors have greater financial flexibility to deploy capital in certain areas as well as more commercial and other resources, marketing and manufacturing organizations, and larger research and development staff. As a result, these companies may be able to pursue strategies or approvals that we are not able to finance or otherwise pursue and may receive FDA, European Medicines Agency or other applicable regulatory approvals more efficiently or rapidly than us. Also, our competitors may have more experience in marketing and selling their products post‑approval, and gaining market acceptance more quickly. Smaller or early‑stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our products could become less competitive if our competitors are able to license or acquire technology that is more effective or less costly and thereby offer an improved or a cheaper alternative to our products. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize will compete on the 

 
  9

 
basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product portfolio in our target commercial markets.
 Government Regulation and Approval Process
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the DEA, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we market. For both currently marketed and future products, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in suspension of regulatory approval and possible civil and criminal sanctions. Regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly evolving and are not always clear. Significant changes in regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Additionally, future healthcare legislation or other legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems, including statutory restrictions on the means that can be employed by brand and generic pharmaceutical companies to settle Paragraph IV patent litigations. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but such initiatives, if passed, could result in significant costs to us in terms of costs of compliance and penalties associated with failure to comply.
 Pharmaceutical Regulation in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, Warning Letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug or a generic version of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  10

 

regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

  When developing a branded product and bringing it to market, the first step in proceeding to clinical studies is preclinical testing. Preclinical tests are intended to provide a laboratory or animal study evaluation of the product to determine its chemistry, formulation and stability. Toxicology studies are also performed to assess the potential safety of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long‑term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
 The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences and it must monitor the study until completed.
 The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. GCP requirements include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, unless a narrow regulatory exemption applies. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase I: In Phase I, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human volunteers or patients, the drug is tested to assess absorption, metabolism, elimination, pharmacokinetics and safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II: Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III: Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase III clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, for example, where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include, among other 

 
  11

 
things, the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two‑tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapies. The FDA endeavors to review most applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months whereas the FDA’s goal is to review most Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.
 The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the labeled indication.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications, or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
 Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post‑marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or certain problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk‑management mechanisms.
 Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA 

 
  12

 
supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Information related to the product, subject population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss certain results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off‑label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability. There also are extensive DEA regulations applicable to controlled substances.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is also required following FDA approval of an ANDA or NDA. Additionally, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality‑control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to comply with cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their marketed products with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality‑control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, Warning Letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
 505(b)(2) NDAs
 The FDA is also authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the data owner. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product that acts as the 

 
  13

 
“listed drug.” The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the conditions of use for which the branded reference drug has been approved, or for a new condition of use sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications
 The Hatch‑Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs, for generic versions of listed drugs. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the API, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the reference listed drug. For some drugs, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the reference listed drug. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not bioequivalent to the reference listed drug if it is intended for a different use or if it is not subject to, and requires, an approved Suitability Petition. Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA (i) that there is no patent listed with the FDA as covering the relevant branded product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the branded product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the branded product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the ANDA will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the ANDA is submitted. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent.
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Non‑Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non‑patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug.
 For example, for listed drugs that were considered new chemical entities at the time of approval, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing that drug may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years after approval of that 

 
  14

 
drug, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. In addition, drugs approved for diseases for which the patient population is sufficiently small, or orphan indications, are entitled to a seven year data exclusivity period.
 Orphan Drugs
 Ontinua ER has received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which means a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from domestic sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA, and both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act and FDA’s implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 316.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
 Orphan drug designation entitles the applicant to incentives such as grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and waivers of FDA user fees. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is also entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process and a subsequent grant of orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 DEA Regulation
 Several of our products, including ConZip, methylphenidate ER (including M‑72) and hydromorphone ER are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with, among other things, the control of handlers of controlled substances and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
 The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Methylphenidate (including methylphenidate ER and M‑72) and hydromorphone (including hydromorphone ER) are listed as Schedule II drugs and tramadol hydrochloride (including ConZip) is listed as a Schedule IV drug by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of Schedule II drugs are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, Schedule II drug prescriptions generally must be signed by a physician and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Substances in Schedule IV are considered to have a lower potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule II. A prescription for controlled substances in Schedule IV may be issued by a practitioner through oral communication, in writing or by facsimile to the pharmacist and may be refilled if so authorized on the prescription or by call‑in. In the future, our other potential products may also be listed by the DEA as controlled substances.

 
  15

 

 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, including, for example, distribution reports for Schedule II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and authorization must be obtained to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule II. Distributions of any Schedule II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a Schedule II substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount of any particular Schedule II substance that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule II substance for use in manufacturing. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our and our contract manufacturers’ quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our and our contract manufacturers’ quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
 Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.
 Regulation of Dietary Supplements
 The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of dietary supplements, such as our OB Complete family of prescription prenatal dietary supplements, are subject to regulation by multiple federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, amended the FDCA to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under the FDCA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without first notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that use of the dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe. A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new 

 
  16

 
dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient or a dietary supplement including such dietary ingredient.
 All facilities that manufacture, process, package, or store food for human consumption, including dietary supplements, must register with the FDA as a food facility under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Facility registrations must be updated biennially. The FDA schedules periodic inspections at registered facilities to determine whether the inspected facilities are in compliance with applicable FDA regulations. The FDA’s cGMP regulations for dietary supplements apply to manufacturers and holders of finished dietary supplement products, including dietary supplements manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things, the FDA’s cGMP regulations: (i) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients; (ii) call for a scientifically valid system for ensuring finished products meet all specifications; (iii) include requirements related to process controls, including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures; and (iv) require extensive recordkeeping. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated” under the FDCA, and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions.
 Dietary supplements are also regulated by various state and local governmental agencies. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements and the National Advertising Division, or NAD, of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry sponsored, self‑regulatory system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own, but may refer matters to the FTC or the FDA for further action.
 Federal agencies, including the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing Warning Letters and cease and desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress, seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution.
 Under the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, the FDA requires, among other things, that companies that manufacture or distribute dietary supplements report serious adverse events associated with their products to the FDA and fulfill certain recordkeeping requirements for adverse events. Based on serious adverse event (or other) information, the FDA may take actions against dietary supplements or dietary ingredients that in its determination present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer warnings with respect to the products or ingredients in such products.
 The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, enacted on January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to enhance the FDA’s authority over various aspects of food regulation, including dietary supplements. Under the FSMA, the FDA is authorized to issue a mandatory recall when the FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that a food, including a dietary supplement, is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Also under the FSMA, the FDA has (i) expanded access to records; (ii) the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high‑risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; (iii) stronger authority to administratively detain food; (iv) the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and (v) the authority to require that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.
 The FSMA requirements may result in the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance, and the potential imposition of fees for re‑inspection of noncompliant facilities.
 The FDCA, as amended by the DSHEA, permits statements of nutritional support often referred to as “structure/function claims” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA premarket approval. FDA regulations require that dietary supplement manufacturers notify the FDA of those statements within 30 days of marketing. Among other things, the statements may describe the role of a dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient maintains such structure or function, 

 
  17

 
but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by available information or is otherwise false or misleading, the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action.
 The FTC and the FDA have pursued a coordinated effort to investigate the scientific substantiation for dietary supplement claims. Their efforts to date have resulted in a significant number of investigations and enforcement actions. Dietary supplement claims could also be the subject of inquiries from the NAD and states’ Attorneys General.
 The FDA has broad authority to enforce the FDCA provisions applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, request a voluntary recall, order a mandatory recall, administratively detain domestic products, detain products offered for import, request the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, to initiate a seizure action, initiate an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, thereby effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process.
 States also regulate foods and drugs under laws that generally parallel federal statutes. These products are also subject to state consumer health and safety regulations, such as the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, or Proposition 65. Violation of Proposition 65 may result in substantial monetary penalties.
 Pricing and Reimbursement
 Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third‑party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Government authorities and third‑party payors increasingly are challenging the price of medical products and services. On the government side, there is a heightened focus, at both the federal and state levels, on cost containment under Medicaid, Medicare and other government benefit programs. For example, we are obligated under the Medicaid drug program to pay rebates on certain utilization of our products, under state Medicaid programs. Many state Medicaid programs have also created preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If our current products or future drug candidates are not included on these preferred drug lists, physicians may not be inclined to prescribe them to their Medicaid patients, thereby diminishing the potential market for our products.The focus on cost containment has also led to an increase in federal and state legislative initiatives related to drug prices, which could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products, resulting in lower prices and changes in product demand.  If enacted, these changes could lead to reduced payments to pharmaceutical manufacturers.
 In addition, third‑party payors have been imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. Third‑party payors may require manufacturers to provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved pharmaceutical products for particular indications. Third‑party payors may challenge the price and examine the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of pharmaceutical products in addition to their safety and efficacy. Manufacturers may need to conduct expensive pharmaco‑economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of pharmaceutical products in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable manufacturers to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their investment in drug development.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last several years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what other legislative proposals may be adopted or what actions federal, state, or private payors may take 

 
  18

 
in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect such reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. The law includes measures that (i) significantly increase Medicaid rebates through both the expansion of the program and significant increases in rebates, (ii) substantially expand the Public Health System (340B) program to allow other entities to purchase prescription drugs at substantial discounts, (iii) extend the Medicaid rebate rate to a significant portion of Managed Medicaid enrollees, (iv) require manufacturers to provide discounts on Medicaid Part D spending in the coverage gap for branded and authorized generic prescription drugs (which discount subsequent legislation increased beginning in 2019), and (v) levy a significant excise tax on the industry to fund the healthcare reform.
 Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called “individual mandate”).  In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by three million in 2019 and six million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate.  The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge.  In December 2018, a federal district court, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the ACA is still operational in all respects.
 There have also been other reform initiatives under the Trump Administration, including initiatives focused on drug pricing.  For example, in May of 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs.  Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry.  As another example, in October 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs to more closely align with international drug prices. As another example, in November of 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed revisions to Medicare Part D to support health plans’ negotiation of lower drug prices with manufacturers and reduce health plan members’ out-of-pocket costs. The Office of Inspector General, or OIG, within the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued a proposed rule in February of 2018 that would revise the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to limit protection for discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, Medicare Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care plans that are not reflected in the price charged to the patient at the pharmacy counter and to provide protection only for certain types of service fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs.

More generally, there has been considerable recent public and government scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals.  There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices or price increases.  Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale.

We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the ACA or other federal and state reform efforts.  There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.

 Healthcare Regulations
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws that are intended to combat health care fraud and abuse and that govern certain of our business practices, especially our interactions with third‑party payors, healthcare providers, patients, customers and potential customers through sales and marketing or research and development activities. These include anti‑kickback laws, false claims laws, sunshine laws, privacy laws and FDA regulation of advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products.
 Anti‑kickback laws, including the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, make it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce or reward referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service reimbursable by, a federal health care program (including our products). The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $100,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration.  A new federal anti-kickback statute enacted in 2018 prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities and laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs. Criminal sanctions (up to $200,000 fine and 10 years imprisonment) can be imposed for violations. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent (and, under the Federal False Claims Act, a claim is deemed false or fraudulent if it is made pursuant to an illegal kickback). Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off‑label. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties, including fines ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other improper sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi‑million and multi‑billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, supplier or practioner providing Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $20,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
 Federal criminal statutes prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, 

 
  20

 
fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As with the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to products and services reimbursed by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including commercial payors. Additionally, there are state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers.  There are also state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report marketing expenditures or pricing information.
 Sunshine laws, including the federal Open Payments law enacted as part of the ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value to physicians and certain other health care providers or professionals. Under the federal Open Payments law pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports annually to the government. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $169,170 per year (or up to an aggregate of $127,799 per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states and foreign governments require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to certain healthcare providers.
 Privacy laws, including HIPAA, restrict how entities may use or disclose health information. Under HIPAA, covered entities are defined to include healthcare providers, such as physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and laboratories, as well as health insurers. Although pharmaceutical manufacturers are not covered entities under HIPAA, our ability to acquire or use protected health information from covered entities to aid in our research, development, sales and marketing activities may be affected by HIPAA and other privacy laws. HIPAA, was amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH. Those changes were adopted in regulation through a final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013. Among other things, HITECH and the omnibus rule made HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” which are defined as contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The FDA regulates the sale and marketing of prescription drug products and, among other things, prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from making false or misleading statements and from promoting products for unapproved uses. There has been an increase in government enforcement efforts at both the federal and state level. Numerous cases have been brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers under the Federal False Claims Act, alleging, among other things, that certain sales or marketing‑related practices violate the Anti‑Kickback Statute or the FDA’s regulations, and many of these cases have resulted in settlement agreements under which the companies were required to change certain practices, pay substantial fines and operate under the supervision of a federally appointed monitor for a period of years. Due to the breadth of these laws and their implementing regulations and the absence of guidance in some cases, it is possible that our practices might be challenged by government authorities. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil and criminal sanctions including fines, civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion of our products from payment by federal health care programs.
 Government Price Reporting
 We must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid drug rebate program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. We must also report specific prices to government

agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid drug rebate program and Medicare Part B.  The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and we are continually evaluating the methods we use to calculate and report the amounts owed with respect to Medicaid and other government pricing programs. Our calculations are subject to review and challenge by various government agencies and authorities, and it is possible that any such review could result either in material changes to the method used for calculating the amounts owed to such agency or the amounts themselves. Because the process for making these calculations, and our judgments supporting these calculations, involve subjective decisions, these calculations are subject to audit. In the event that a government authority challenges or finds ambiguity with regard to our report of payments, such authority may impose civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time we conduct routine reviews of our government pricing calculations. These reviews may have an impact on government price reporting and rebate calculations used to comply with various government regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations.
 Many government and third‑party payors reimburse the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug’s average wholesale price, or AWP. In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers’ reporting practices with respect to AWP, which they have suggested have led to excessive payments by state and federal government agencies for prescription drugs. We and numerous other pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in various state and federal court actions alleging improper or fraudulent practices related to the reporting of AWP.
 Drug Pedigree Laws
 State and federal governments have proposed or passed various drug pedigree laws which can require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs from the manufacturer to the pharmacy (or other dispensing) level. Companies are required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody of prescription drug products beginning with the purchase of such products from the manufacturer. Compliance with these pedigree laws requires implementation of extensive tracking systems as well as heightened documentation and coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we fully intend to comply with these laws, there is uncertainty about future changes in legislation and government enforcement of these laws. Failure to comply could result in fines or penalties, as well as loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements
 As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are required to file with the FTC and DOJ certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the settlement of patent litigation or manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies, and could result generally in an increase in private‑party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities. Other
 The U.S. federal government, various states and localities have laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals, as well as regulations dealing with the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs. Our operations are also subject to regulation, licensing requirements and inspection by the states and localities in which our operations are located or in which we conduct business.
 Certain of our activities are also subject to FTC enforcement actions. The FTC also enforces a variety of antitrust and consumer protection laws designed to ensure that the nation’s markets function competitively, are vigorous, efficient and free of undue restrictions. Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us.
 In addition, we are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of 

 
  22

 
toxic and hazardous substances, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the cleanup of contamination. We are required to maintain and comply with environmental permits and controls for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could incur significant costs or liabilities as a result of any failure to comply with environmental laws, including fines, penalties, third‑party claims and the costs of undertaking a clean‑up at a current or former site or at a site to which our wastes were transported. In addition, we have grown in part by acquisition, and our diligence may not have identified environmental impacts from historical operations at sites we have acquired in the past or may acquire in the future.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 466 full time employees (including 47 employees in Argentina and five employees in Hungary). We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our current relations with our employees to be good. Reorganization and Our Structure
 On April 30, 2018, Osmotica Holdings S.C.Sp. acquired Lilydale Limited, an Irish private company with limited liability that was organized in Ireland on July 13, 2017, and renamed such entity Osmotica Pharmaceuticals Limited, effective May 1, 2018. On July 31, 2018, Osmotica Pharmaceuticals Limited re-registered under the Irish Companies Act of 2014 as a public limited company and was renamed Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc. In addition, immediately prior to our initial public offering and prior to the commencement of trading of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, we undertook a series of restructuring transactions that resulted in Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc becoming the direct parent company of Osmotica Holdings S.C.Sp., with each holder of common units of Osmotica Holdings S.C.Sp. receiving approximately 42.84 ordinary shares of Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc in exchange for each such common unit. In addition, each holder of an option to purchase common units of Osmotica Holdings S.C.Sp. received an option to purchase the number of ordinary shares of Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc determined by multiplying the number of units underlying such option by approximately 42.84 (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and dividing the exercise price per unit for such option by approximately 42.84 (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Prior to this time, Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc did not conduct any operations (other than activities incidental to its formation, this reorganization and our initial public offering). Upon the completion of this reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Osmotica Holdings S.C.Sp. became the historical financial statements of Osmotica Pharmaceuticals plc. Except as otherwise indicated, all information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K gives effect to this reorganization. Corporate Information
