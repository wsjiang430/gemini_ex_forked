(“CAD”) in Phoenix, Arizona. This segment manufactures precision components primarily for customers in the aerospace industry.  This segment provides complete end-to-end engineering, machining, grinding, welding, brazing, heat treat and assembly solutions.

Industrial Hose:
The Industrial Hose segment was added July 1, 2016, when the Company purchased the assets of the Federal Hose Manufacturing, LLC in Painesville, Ohio. This business segment includes the manufacture of flexible interlocking metal hoses and the distribution of silicone and hydraulic hoses. Metal hoses are sold primarily to major heavy-duty truck manufacturers and major aftermarket suppliers in North America. Metal hoses are also sold into the agricultural, industrial and petrochemical markets. Silicone hoses are distributed to a number of industries in North America, including agriculture and general industrial markets.
Test and Measurement:
The Test and Measurement segment is the legacy business that was started in 1910 when the Company was founded, and was sold June 1, 2018. This business segment included electronic testing products designed and manufactured for the automotive and trucking industries and includes indicators and gauges for the locomotive and aircraft industries. The automotive diagnostic products are sold to original equipment manufacturers and to the aftermarket under several brand names and through a variety of distribution methods. In the aircraft industry, primary customers are manufacturers of commercial, military and personal airplanes. In the locomotive industry, indicators and gauges are sold to manufacturers and servicers of railroad equipment and locomotives.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the business segments are acquired from a large number of domestic manufacturers and some materials are purchased from European and Southeast Asian sources.

The Aerospace Components segment uses various materials in the manufacture of its products, the most significant being forgings and castings. Two suppliers provide over 50% of inventory purchases in this segment. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, the Company would need to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from its other qualified sources.
 
The Industrial Hose segment uses various materials in the manufacture of its products, including steel fittings and hose packing consisting of silicone, cotton and copper wire. Two suppliers provide over 50% of inventory purchases in this segment. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, the Company would need to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from its other qualified sources.
 
Aluminum, the major raw material used in construction of the Commercial Air Handling units, is sourced from one major supplier but is generally readily available from other sources. Copper is used by suppliers of a major component used in the product and the Company maintains relationships with three suppliers of these components to limit vulnerability. The Company maintains relationships with multiple suppliers for most of the other componentry used in assembly of the product, in order to maintain best costs for material and competitive lead times. The majority of materials for this segment are sourced domestically or from Canada.
 
The Company believes it has adequate sources of supply for its primary raw materials and components and has not had difficulty in obtaining the raw materials, component parts or finished goods from its suppliers.
 
Importance of Patents, Licenses, Franchises, Trademarks and Concessions
The Company had a number of patents that related to its Test and Measurement segment that was divested in June 2018. There are no significant patents associated with the Company’s existing operations. Other than the names "Hickok," "Waekon," “Federal Hose” and “Air Enterprises” and the FactoryBilt® and SiteBilt® registered trademarks, the Company does not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions.
Seasonality
In light of the markets served by its products, the Company does not believe that its Aerospace Components, Industrial Hose, or Commercial Air Handling businesses are seasonal in nature. The Company believes that seasonality impacted the Test and Measurement segment based upon the automotive aftermarket revenues, as the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year tend to be weaker than the other two quarters in this market. Since this segment was divested in June 2018, this seasonality will not affect operating results going forward.
Dependence on Customers
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, sales to two customers in the Commercial Air Handling segment were 14% of consolidated sales of the Company, while one customer in the Aerospace Components segment accounted for 19% of consolidated sales. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, sales to two customers in the Commercial Air Handling segment were 22% of consolidated sales of the Company. In fiscal year 2017, there were no sales to any one customer greater than 10% of consolidated sales of the Company. The Company has long-term contractual relationships with a large customer in the Aerospace Components segment.

Competition in the Commercial Air Handling segment comes from both custom and non-custom air handling solution manufacturers. The Company believes that it has a strong competitive position due to the high quality and long life of the Company’s customized aluminum air handling solutions.
