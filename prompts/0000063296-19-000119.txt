Customers of the Memorialization segment can also purchase memorials and vases on a "pre-need" basis.  The "pre-need" concept permits families to arrange for these purchases in advance of their actual need.  Upon request, the Company will manufacture the memorial to the customer's specifications (e.g., name and birth date) and place it in storage for future delivery.  Memorials in storage have been paid in full with title conveyed to each pre-need purchaser.
The segment is also a leading manufacturer and distributor of caskets and other funeral home products in North America.  The segment produces and markets metal, wood and cremation caskets.

ITEM 1.        BUSINESS, (continued)

Metal caskets are made from various gauges of cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze.  Metal caskets are generally categorized by whether the casket is non-gasketed or gasketed, and by material (i.e., bronze, copper, or steel) and in the case of steel, by the gauge (thickness) of the metal.  Wood caskets are primarily manufactured from nine different species of wood.  The species of wood used are poplar, pine, ash, oak, pecan, maple, cherry, walnut and mahogany.  The Memorialization segment is a leading manufacturer of all-wood constructed caskets, which are manufactured using pegged and dowelled construction, and include no metal parts.  Cremation caskets are made primarily from wood or cardboard covered with cloth or veneer.  These caskets appeal primarily to cremation consumers, environmentally concerned consumers, and value buyers.
The Memorialization segment also produces casket components.  Casket components include stamped metal parts, metal locking mechanisms for gasketed metal caskets, adjustable beds and interior panels.  Metal casket parts are produced by stamping cold-rolled steel, stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets into casket component parts.

The principal markets for these products are funeral homes, cemeteries, crematories, pet crematories, animal disposers and veterinarians. These products primarily are marketed directly by segment personnel.  Human crematory management/operations represent the actual operation and management of client-owned crematories.  Currently the segment provides these services primarily to municipalities and private operators in the United States and Europe.  Cremation service and supplies consist of operator training, preventative maintenance and on-demand service work performed on various makes and models of equipment. This work can be as simple as replacing defective bulbs or as complex as complete reconstruction and upgrading or retro-fitting on site. Supplies are consumable items and replacement parts associated with normal crematory operations.
Waste incineration systems encompass both batch load and continuous feed, static and rotary systems for incineration of all waste types, as well as equipment for in-loading waste, out-loading ash and energy recovery. The principal markets for these products are animal and medical waste disposal, oil and gas "work camp" wastes, industrial wastes and bio-mass generators.

The principal markets for the segment's architectural products are corporations, fraternal organizations, contractors, churches, hospitals, schools and government agencies.  These products are sold to and distributed through a network of independent dealers including sign suppliers, awards and recognition companies, and trophy dealers.
ITEM 1.        BUSINESS, (continued)

Raw materials used by the Memorialization segment to manufacture memorials consist principally of bronze and aluminum ingot, granite, sheet metal, coating materials, photopolymers and construction materials and are generally available in adequate supply.  Ingot is obtained from various North American, European and Australian smelters. The primary materials required for casket manufacturing are cold-rolled steel and lumber. The segment also purchases copper, bronze, stainless steel, particleboard, corrugated materials, paper veneer, cloth, ornamental hardware and coating materials. Purchase orders or supply agreements are typically negotiated with large, integrated steel producers that have demonstrated timely delivery, high quality material and competitive prices.  Lumber is purchased from a number of sawmills and lumber distributors.  Raw materials used to manufacture cremation and incineration products consist principally of structural steel, sheet metal, electrical components, combustion devices and refractory materials. These are generally available in adequate supply from numerous suppliers.
Competition from other manufacturers of memorial products is on the basis of reputation, product quality, delivery, price, and design availability. The Company believes that its superior quality, broad product lines, innovative designs, delivery capability, customer responsiveness, experienced personnel and consumer-oriented merchandising systems are competitive advantages in its markets.  Competition in the mausoleum construction industry includes various construction companies throughout North America and is on the basis of design, quality and price.  Competitors in the architectural market are numerous and include companies that manufacture cast and painted signs, plastic materials, sand-blasted wood and other fabricated products.
The Memorialization segment markets its casket products in the United States through a combination of Company-owned and independent casket distribution facilities.  The Company operates approximately 100 distribution centers in the United States.  Approximately 85% of the segment's casket products are currently sold through Company-owned distribution centers.  The casket business is highly competitive and the Company competes with other manufacturers on the basis of product quality, price, service, design availability and breadth of product line.  The Memorialization segment provides a line of casket products that it believes is as comprehensive as any of its major competitors.  There are a large number of casket industry participants operating in North America and also a few foreign casket manufacturers, primarily from China, participating in the North American market.  
The Company competes with several manufacturers in the cremation and accessory equipment market principally on the basis of product design, quality and price.  The Memorialization segment and its three largest global competitors account for a substantial portion of the United States and European cremation equipment market.
The Memorialization segment works to provide a total solution to customers that own and operate businesses in both the cemetery and funeral home markets. The Company's memorial and casket products serve the relatively stable casketed and in-ground burial death market, while its memorial products and cremation equipment also serve the growing cremation market.
Industrial Technologies:
The Industrial Technologies segment designs, manufactures and distributes a wide range of marking and coding equipment and consumables, industrial automation solutions, and warehouse automation systems.  Manufacturers, suppliers and distributors worldwide rely on Matthews' integrated systems to identify, track and pick their products.
Marking systems range from stand-alone marking products to complex ink-jet printing systems that integrate into a customer's production process.  The Company manufactures and markets products and systems that employ different marking technologies, including laser and ink-jet printing.  These technologies apply product information required for identification and traceability, as well as to facilitate inventory and quality control, regulatory compliance and brand name communication.
Warehouse automation systems complement the tracking and distribution of a customer's products with automated order fulfillment technologies, autonomous mobile robotics, and controls for material handling systems.  Material handling customers include some of the largest retail, eCommerce, and automated assembly companies in the United States.  The Company also engineers innovative, custom solutions to address specific customer requirements in a variety of industries, including oil field services and security scanning.
A significant portion of the revenue of the Industrial Technologies segment is attributable to the sale of consumables and replacement parts required by the marking, coding and tracking products sold by Matthews.  The Company develops inks exclusively for the use with its marking equipment which is critical to ensure ongoing equipment reliability and mark quality.
The principal customers for the Company's marking and fulfillment systems products are manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of durable goods, building products, consumer goods manufacturers (including food and beverage processors) and producers of pharmaceuticals.  The Company also serves a wide variety of industrial markets, including metal fabricators, manufacturers of woven and non-woven fabrics, plastic, rubber and automotive products.
ITEM 1.        BUSINESS, (continued)

A portion of this segment's sales are outside the United States, with distribution sourced through the Company's subsidiaries in Sweden, Germany and China in addition to other international distributors.  The Company owns a minority interest in distributors in Asia, Australia and Europe.
Major raw materials for this segment's products include precision components, electronics, printing components and chemicals, all of which are presently available in adequate supply from various sources.
Competitors in the marking and fulfillment systems industries are diverse, with some companies offering limited product lines for well-defined specialty markets, while others operate similarly to the Company, offering a broad product line and competing in multiple product markets and countries.  Competitive differentiation for marking and fulfillment systems products is based on product performance, ease of integration into the manufacturing and/or distribution process, service and price.  The Company typically competes with specialty companies in specific brand marking solutions and traceability applications.  The Company believes that, in general, its Industrial Technologies segment offers one of the broadest lines of products to address a wide variety of marking, coding and industrial automation applications.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES:
The Company holds a number of trademarks and in excess of 100 domestic and foreign patents for its products and related technologies.  However, the Company believes the loss of any individual or a significant number of patents or trademarks would not have a material impact on consolidated operations or revenues.
BACKLOG:
Because the nature of the Company's SGK Brand Solutions, Memorialization and Industrial Technologies businesses are primarily custom products made to order and services with short lead times, backlogs are not generally material except for rotogravure engineering projects in the SGK Brand Solutions segment, mausoleums and cremation equipment in the Memorialization segment and industrial automation and order fulfillment systems in the Industrial Technologies segment.  Backlogs vary in a range of approximately six to twelve months of sales for rotogravure engineering projects and mausoleums.
