Item 1. | Business.

Overview
Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRNE), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is a clinical stage and commercial biopharma company focused on delivering innovative and clinically meaningful therapies to patients and their families, globally, to address unmet medical needs. We primarily focus on therapeutics areas in Immune-Oncology and Non-Opioid Pain Management. We also have programs assessing the use of our technologies and products in autoimmune, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.
At our core, we are an antibody-centric company and leverage our proprietary G-MAB™ library and targeted delivery modalities to generate the next generation of cancer therapeutics. Our fully human antibodies include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, CD123, CD47, c-MET, VEGFR2, CCR2 and CD137 among others.
Our vision is to leverage these antibodies in conjunction with proprietary targeted delivery modalities to generate the next generation of cancer therapeutics. These modalities include proprietary chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (“CAR-T”), dimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (“DAR-T”), antibody drug conjugates (“ADCs”) as well as bispecific antibody approaches. Additionally, we acquired Sofusa®, a revolutionary drug delivery system, in July 2018, which delivers biologics directly into the lymphatic system to potentially achieve improved efficacy and fewer adverse effects than standard parenteral immunotherapy. 
With each of our clinical and pre-clinical programs, we aim to tailor our therapies to treat specific stages in the evolution of cancer, from elimination, to equilibrium and escape. In addition, our objective is to focus on tumors that are resistant to current treatments and where we can design focused trials based on a genetic signature or biomarker to ensure patients have the best chance of a durable and significant response. We have several immuno-oncology programs that are in or near to entering the clinic. These include cellular therapies, an oncolytic virus and a palliative care program targeted to treat intractable

cancer pain. Our cellular therapy programs focus on CAR-T for adoptive cellular immunotherapy to treat both solid and liquid tumors. We have reported early data from Phase I trials of our carcinoembryonic antigen (“CEA”)-directed CAR-T program. We have treated five patients with stage 4, unresectable adenocarcinoma (four with pancreatic and one with colorectal cancer) and CEA-positive liver metastases with anti-CEA CAR-T and are currently expanding this study. We successfully submitted an Investigational New Drug application ("IND") for anti-CD38 CAR-T for the treatment of refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma ("RRMM") and obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") to commence a human clinical trial for this indication in early 2018. We have dosed two patients and are continuing the enrollment of additional patients.
Broadly speaking, we are one of the world’s leading CAR-T companies today due to our investments in technology and infrastructure, which have enabled significant progress in developing our next-generation non-viral, “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR-T solutions. With “off-the-shelf” solutions, CAR-T therapy can truly become a drug product rather than a treatment procedure. One of the approaches we have taken to develop the “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR-T solutions is through Celularity, our joint venture with Celgene, United Therapeutics and others. Celularity focuses on developing cell therapies with placenta-derived and cord blood T cells, which have natural allogeneic “off-the-shelf” characteristics. We are the single largest shareholder of Celularity with a stake of approximately 25%.
Outside of immune-oncology programs, as part of our global aim to provide a wide range of therapeutic products to meet underserved markets, we have made investments in non-opioid pain management. These include resiniferatoxin (“RTX”), which is a non-opioid-based neurotoxin that specifically ablates nerves that conduct pain signals while leaving other nerve functions intact and is being studied for chronic pain treatment. RTX has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of intractable pain with end-stage cancer and a Phase I trial with the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) is concluding. A Phase Ib trial studying tolerance and efficacy of RTX for the control of osteoarthritis knee pain was initiated in late 2018 and preliminary results have shown strong efficacy with no significant adverse effects. Other applications of RTX are expected to start Phase Ib trials in 2019.
Also in the area of non-opioid pain management, we have acquired proprietary technologies to responsibly develop next generation, branded pharmaceutical products to better manage patients’ medical conditions and maximize the quality of life of patients and healthcare providers. The flagship product of our majority-owned subsidiary, Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Scilex”), ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%), is a next-generation lidocaine delivery system which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, a severe neuropathic pain condition, in February 2018, and was commercially launched in late October 2018. Scilex now has built a full commercial organization, which includes sales, marketing, market access, and medical affairs. ZTlido® is positioned as a best-in-class product with superior adhesion compared to Lidoderm and is manufactured by our Japanese partner in their state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.

Our Strategy
Our primary goal is to deliver clinically meaningful therapies to patients and their families, globally. In immuno-oncology, we aim to deliver next generation therapeutics to transform cancer into a treatable or chronically manageable disease. Across all our programs, we are focused on addressing severe unmet medical needs where our therapies can change the natural course of disease or significantly improve a patient’s quality of life.
Our core strategic objectives and resources are focused on:

1. | Rapidly advancing our lead product candidates through the clinic. These include the initiation of Phase I, Phase II and potentially accelerated approval trials for our cellular therapies and oncolytic virus immunotherapy in oncology and/or hematology indications. Our clinical-state RTX program will be developed in several pain indications with high-unmet medical needs.


2. | Continuing the development of our preclinical programs with the aim of filing several new INDs over the next 12-18 months. These include moving our checkpoint inhibitors from our core antibody portfolio into the clinic either ourselves or with our strategic partners. Also, we will utilize our fully human antibody portfolio for the development of ADCs and bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”). In addition, we plan to start several clinical trials with the Sofusa® device to explore safety and efficacy features of this innovative drug delivery system.


3. | Collaborating with key opinion leaders and leading clinical and research institutes to enhance our preclinical and clinical development plans. We currently have such agreements in place with the Karolinska Institute, The Scripps Research Institute (“TSRI”), the NIH, City of Hope, Tufts Medical School, and Roger Williams Medical Center, among others.


4. | Manufacturing our preclinical and clinical materials in-house. We have established quality control and quality assurance programs, which include standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.


5. | Exploring strategic partnerships to share in the risk reward of our core franchises and to derive near term value from our non-core programs. Our partnering objectives include generating revenue through license fees, milestone-related development fees and royalties as well as profit shares or joint ventures to generate potential returns from our product candidates and technologies.

Segment Information
We have determined that we operate in one operating segment. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Clinical Programs
CD38 Directed CAR-T Program
Our proprietary, second generation anti-CD38 CAR-T therapy is being developed for the treatment of multiple myeloma and for additional potential indications, including amyloidosis and graft-versus-host disease. Our anti-CD38 CAR-T is based on a fully human anti-CD38 mAb derived from our G-MAB™ antibody library.
The membrane glycoprotein CD38 is widely found on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid lineages including B, T and NK cells, but absent from most mature resting lymphocytes with the notable exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells. Because CD38 is highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells, it represents a valuable and validated therapeutic target against myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy in which clonal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow or extramedullary sites and give rise to clinical complications such as painful, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, cytopenias, and symptomatic plasmacytomas.
3

The American Cancer Society estimated 30,280 new cases and 12,590 deaths from multiple myeloma in the U.S. during 2017. The anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody DARZALEX® (daratumumab), marketed by Janssen Oncology, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma on November 16, 2015. Worldwide net sales of DARZALEX® were $572 million in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2017. We are encouraged by the validation of this important target in the market for multiple myeloma therapeutics and its rapid adoption by clinicians in the myeloma community. We believe our CD38 cellular therapy will provide an additional significant advance in the CD38 blockade for multiple myeloma patients that are resistant or have failed current therapies.
In a xenograft mouse model of human myeloma, we demonstrated that CD38-expressing multiple myeloma tumor cells were efficiently killed and tumors were completely eradicated by our anti-CD38 CAR-T. Importantly, these anti-CD38 CAR-T cells selectively killed multiple myeloma target cells expressing high levels of CD38 while avoiding the killing of cells with normal or low levels of CD38. We believe this unique characteristic may result in a more tolerable safety profile in humans and enable a more effective manufacturing process of our anti-CD38 CAR-T cells since we do not anticipate requiring a genetic CD38 knock-out or knock-down in our construct. We have successfully submitted an IND for anti-CD38 CAR-T for the treatment of RRMM and have obtained approval from the FDA to commence a human clinical trial for this indication. We began an anti-CD38 CAR-T clinical trial with RRMM patients in 2018 and recruitment continues in the dose-escalation phase of the study. There has been evidence of CAR-T cell activation and early signs of efficacy at low doses of the anti-CD38 CAR-T cells.
CEA Directed CAR-T Program
A second-generation anti-CEA CAR-T cell therapy is being developed for the regional treatment of liver metastases due to CEA-expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma via pressure-enabled hepatic arterial infusion of CAR-T. 
CEA is highly expressed in the majority of primary and metastatic cancers of gastrointestinal origin, including adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In addition, liver metastases often express CEA at higher levels than the primary pancreatic tumor. However, CEA is also expressed on normal cells of the colonic epithelium and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, systemic intravenous infusions of anti-CEA CAR-T cells have been associated with colitis and symptoms of severe diarrhea. Regional infusions of anti-CEA CAR-T cells directly into the liver through the hepatic artery with a pressure-enabled device increases the delivery of the CAR-T cells directly to the metastatic tumors in the liver and reduces the risk of severe on-target/off-tumor effects, cytokine release syndrome, and neurotoxicity adverse events associated with intravenous infusions. 
Pancreatic cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and is a high-unmet medical need. Most pancreatic cancer patients are asymptomatic until advanced disease develops. Up to 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with metastatic disease. The survival rates for pancreatic cancer patients at 1 and 5 years are only 29% and 7%, respectively. Liver metastases occur frequently and are a common cause of mortality and morbidity. Our early-phase clinical trial of anti-CEA CAR-T delivered to patients with pancreatic carcinoma and liver metastases via pressure-enabled hepatic artery infusion has demonstrated complete metabolic and radiologic responses within the liver in two of four patients by PET scans and CT scans, respectively. Based on these promising results, we are planning a randomized trial with FDA advice this year to study overall survival in patients with CEA-expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastases treated with regionally administered anti-CEA CAR-T cells.
Resiniferatoxin (RTX) Programs
RTX is a naturally occurring compound obtained from cactus-like succulents of the Euphorbia species. An ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist, RTX belongs to the same family as capsaicin, the active ingredient in red chili peppers. As an agonist, RTX produces a sustained opening of calcium channels located in the end-terminal or cell body of C-fiber nerves (depending upon the route of administration). This, in turn, generates a rapid and massive cation influx into the nerve and sustained depolarization results in cytotoxicity and ablation of TRPV1-positive cells that conduct pain signals, while leaving non-TPVR1 containing nerves (touch, motor control, joint position) intact. RTX is differentiated from other agonists, including capsaicin, in that it is significantly more potent at desensitizing than it is in inducing excitation of the neuron. In fact, it has been proposed that because RTX is several thousand times more potent than capsaicin at desensitization, the higher potency of RTX may lead to a briefer noxious (e.g., painful) period immediately after exposure.
RTX was tested in an investigator-sponsored Phase I clinical trial at the NIH under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). To date, 13 patients with terminal cancer pain have been treated intrathecally at the NIH. A second sponsor-led trial for the control of intractable cancer pain is assessing the tolerance and efficacy of RTX administered epidurally. This dose-escalation trial is progressing and 4 patients have been enrolled thus far.
4

More recent studies in animals (translational work from our animal health subsidiary) have unveiled the clinical potential of RTX intra-articular injections for the control of pain associated with moderate to severe arthritis. Safety studies have been completed and a Phase I clinical trial in humans started in the second half of 2018. Significant activity in relieving pain associated with severe osteoarthritis of the knee was observed and RTX has been well tolerated at the doses administered. Two independent phase III pivotal trials are planned to start in the second half of 2019 and they could be completed in 12 to 18 months - advancing the program closer to a regulatory filing by 2021.
RTX is being manufactured under cGMP and we have sufficient drug product to complete the clinical development programs across multiple additional indications. We have also secured enough raw materials for the drug production to cover the commercial needs for several years and additional contracts are in progress to ensure long-term commercial supplies.

Technologies and Preclinical Pipeline
G-MAB™: Fully Human Antibody Library Platform
Our G-MAB™ library, which forms the backbone of many of our product candidates, was initially invented by Henry Ji, Ph.D., our co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe our proprietary G-MAB™ library is one of the industry’s largest and most diverse fully human antibody libraries, with an estimated one quadrillion unique antibodies available for drug discovery and development. We believe G-MAB™ may offer the following advantages over competing antibody libraries:

• | G-MAB™ has been designed to provide a full spectrum of human immunoglobulin gene recombination in fully-human mAbs. Unlike chimeric and humanization technologies, G-MAB™ has allowed the generation of antibodies with fully-human protein sequences without the challenges and limitations of animal-to-human gene transfer procedures.


• | Because G-MAB™ represents an in vitro human mAb library technology, research suggests that it enables faster and cost-effective in vitro screening of a large number of antigens. G-MAB™ is designed so that any antigen of interest can be investigated, with no dependence on the successful induction of a host immune response against the antigen.

The following is a depiction of the types of fully human mAbs that we have derived from G-MAB™. It includes antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets, from small molecular weight antigens to large protein complexes antigens, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptors (“GPCRs”), a difficult class of antigens to raise therapeutic antibodies against.
6



Our objective is to leverage G-MAB™ to develop first in class or best in class antibody drug candidates that will possess greater efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to existing drugs and develop them as novel monotherapies, ADCs (such as c-MET), components of bispecific antibodies, and as part of our adoptive immunotherapy (CD38, BCMA), oncolytic virus program and intracellular targeting programs (STAT3, mutant KRAS).
To date, we have screened over 100 validated targets and generated a number of fully human antibodies against these targets which are at various stages of development. These include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, BCMA, CTLA-4, CD123, CD47, c-MET, VEGFR2, CCR2 and CD137 among others. Upon the completion of preclinical studies, our objective is to, independently or in tandem with our strategic collaborators, file INDs for these product candidates.
The following diagrams highlight our key antibody-related strategic partnerships and programs:

Dimeric Antigen Receptor (“DAR”) Technology
Chimeric antigen receptors (“CARs”) have been created for commercial and clinical development programs in the industry, so there is strong proof-of-concept for this approach, but there are also disadvantages with this technology. The architecture of the CAR consists of a single fusion protein with several functional components: a single-chain variable fragment (“scFv”) derived from an anti-tumor antibody fused to a structural support segment, a transmembrane portion, and one or more intracellular signaling domains. Potential drawbacks of the CAR technology are the use of scFv that often possess inferior biophysical stability and biochemical functionality compared to their parental antibodies. 
We are addressing these potential weaknesses while building on the clinical experience generated within our current CAR-T programs with the design of DARs that are based on the complete antigen-binding fragment (“Fab”) of the parental antibody. It is generally accepted that Fabs more closely mimic the functional and biophysical properties of natural antibodies. Utilizing the same antibody binding domain sequence, we have compared CAR constructs with a scFv binding domain to a DAR construct with an Fab or two chain binding domain. Our data showed that the DAR-T cells exhibited a higher functional activity with regards to cytokine production, and cytotoxicity against target-expressing tumor cells compared to CAR-T cells. In preclinical mouse models, the DAR-T cells demonstrated increased anti-tumor potency as well. 
7

We are currently applying our DAR technology to our ongoing cell therapy programs for multiple hematological and solid tumor indications, including but not limited to: multiple myeloma, lymphoma, liver cancer, sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and glioma. Utilizing the vast portfolio of target-specific, fully human monoclonal antibodies discovered from our proprietary G-MAB library, we plan on submitting one or more INDs for our lead DAR-T programs in 2019.
Non-viral Knock-Out, Knock-In (“KOKI”) Technology 
We have developed an innovative KOKI technology to introduce transgenes, for example CAR or DAR genes, into mammalian cells, such as T cells. These CAR-T cells have been evaluated and compared against CAR-T cells generated using current retrovirus transduction methodologies. Our data suggest that the non-virally generated CAR-T cells performed as well as retrovirally-transduced CAR-T cells with regard to CAR expression, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity against target-expressing tumor cells.
Our KOKI technology may offer several potential benefits over existing virus-based technology using transgene-encoding lentivirus, retrovirus or adeno-associated virus ("AAV") to introduce antigen receptor constructs into healthy donor (allogeneic) or cancer patient (autologous) T cells. These potential advantages of our non-viral KOKI technology include: 
•site-specific integration of transgenes into a pre-selected locus in the T cell genome;
•streamlined method for transgene construct production without need for laborious and time-consuming virus production, release and validation processes, resulting in a shorter research and development timelines for IND-enabling activities; and 
•applicability to both autologous and allogeneic cellular therapies.
We are developing our innovative KOKI technology for use in our CAR-T programs for the treatment of multiple hematological and solid tumor indications, including but not limited to: multiple myeloma, lymphoma, liver cancer, sarcoma, pancreatic cancer and glioma. We believe our KOKI technology has the potential to enable faster development timelines, more cost-effective cGMP manufacturing and possible removal of certain regulatory requirements for both autologous and allogeneic CAR-T and DAR-T therapies.
Sofusa®
Sofusa is a novel micro-epidermal infusion system that consists of a proprietary microneedle array and microfluidics reservoir for targeted lymphatic delivery of large molecules, such as antibodies. Abnormal lymphatic function is implicated in many conditions associated with immune suppression (oncology) and immune stimulation (autoimmune). Sofusa’s proprietary polymer nanotopography (draped over microneedles) has been shown to activate cellular pathways and enhance paracellular and transcellular transport across the epidermis. This enables efficient and direct absorption into both systemic and lymphatic microcapillaries just beneath the epidermis.
Sofusa’s unique biodistribution profile offers the potential for differentiated safety and efficacy versus IV and subcutaneous administration due to higher immune system concentrations and lower systemic concentrations of immune therapies. In 2018, pre-clinical animal models validated this hypothesis in oncology with an anti-CTLA4 (Yervoy®) and in rheumatoid arthritis with an anti-TNF- α (Enbrel®). In addition, a Phase I study with an imaging agent gave visual confirmation of direct lymphatic targeting and provided important verification of device design parameters. Phase 1b human clinical studies are planned in 2019 to begin development of highly differentiated immunotherapies. 
8

While checkpoint inhibitors have been a major advance in treatment of certain types of cancer, response rates and dose limiting toxicities are areas for improvement. Two checkpoint inhibitor development programs have been initiated to evaluate the impact of lymphatic targeting using anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Pilot trials are being designed to evaluate the feasibility of Sofusa delivery of anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies in patients with melanoma and other skin cancers accessible to biopsies for intensive biomarker assessments. These trials will help assess whether the principles of better efficacy and safety seen in lymphatic administration of drugs in animal models can be replicated in patients. 
Preclinical arthritis models with Sofusa and an anti-TNF alpha blocker (Enbrel®) have demonstrated a highly statistically significant efficacy signal and restoration of lymphatic flow, which is disrupted in some rheumatologic conditions.  Given these encouraging findings, a Phase 1B clinical trial is being initiated in Rheumatoid Arthritis to evaluate the impact of lymphatic on suppression of overactive immune response. Patients who no longer respond to methotrexate will be treated with Sofusa lymphatic delivery vs traditional subcutaneous injections and evaluated for clinical response and lymphatic flow and function. If successful, the Sofusa® DoseDisc™ wearable (wear time 30 minutes to 2 hours) offers the potential for both improved clinical response and a more convenient dosing alternative to traditional injections for patients. The FDA has now approved an IND to proceed with this Phase 1b Sofusa-etanercept study which will advance our efforts to develop our biosimilar assets as bio-better therapeutics, and/or for potential licensing opportunities.
Scilex Pharmaceuticals: ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%) 
Scilex leverages its core, proprietary technologies to responsibly develop next generation, branded pharmaceutical products to better manage critical conditions and maximize the quality of life of patients and healthcare providers. Scilex’s lead product candidate, ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%), is a next-generation lidocaine delivery system approved by the FDA in February 2018 for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (“PHN”), a severe neuropathic pain condition. Having raised $140.0 million in financing in September 2018, Scilex commercially launched ZTlido® in late October 2018. Scilex has built a full commercial organization with over 100 experienced pain medicine sales representatives, supported by teams in market access, medical affairs and marketing. Currently, approximately 100 million lives are covered by commercial payers for ZTlido®.
The elderly population, individuals that have suffered a shingles infection, HIV/AIDS and cancer patients are at the highest risk of developing PHN. The 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prescribing Opioids in 
9

Chronic Pain recommends topical lidocaine for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The prescription lidocaine patch market for all indications totaled almost $700.0 million in 2015 in the U.S.
ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%) is based on a novel and proprietary technology and contains only 36 mg of lidocaine but delivers the same amount of lidocaine compared to Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Lidoderm® (lidocaine patch 5%), which holds 700 mg of lidocaine per patch. On February 28, 2018, the FDA approved ZTlido® (lidocaine topical system 1.8%) for the relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. Scilex is exploring potential partnerships for the product in both European and Chinese markets.
See the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the risks relating to the execution of our business strategy.

The Scilex Notes may be redeemed in whole at any time upon 30 days’ written notice at Scilex’s option prior to August 15, 2026 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Scilex Notes. In addition, upon a change of control of Scilex (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of a Scilex Note shall have the right to require Scilex to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Scilex Note at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the then-outstanding principal amount thereof.
Oaktree Term Loan Agreement
On November 7, 2018, we and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”) entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with certain funds and accounts managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (collectively, the “Lenders”) and Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, as administrative and collateral agent, for an initial term loan of $100.0 million (the “Initial Loan”) and a second tranche of $50.0 million, subject to the achievement of certain commercial and financial milestones between August 7, 2019 and November 7, 2019, and the satisfaction of certain customary conditions (the “Conditional Loan”). The Initial Loan was funded on November 7, 2018. The net proceeds of the Initial Loan were approximately $91.3 million, after deducting estimated loan costs, commissions, fees and expenses, and will be used for general corporate purposes. In connection with the Loan Agreement, on November 7, 2018, we issued to the Lenders warrants to purchase 6,288,985 shares of our common stock (the “Initial Warrants”). The Initial Warrants have an exercise price per share of $3.28, subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions, will be exercisable from May 7, 2019 through May 7, 2029 and will be exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Initial Warrants (the “Initial Warrant 
11

Shares”), in which case the Initial Warrants shall also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis. If the Conditional Loan is funded, we will issue to the Lenders additional warrants to purchase such number of shares of our common stock as is equal to 2% of our fully-diluted shares on the date the Conditional Loan is funded, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (the “Conditional Warrants”). The Conditional Warrants will have an exercise price per share equal to the average volume-weighted average price of one share of our common stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date the Conditional Loan is funded, will be exercisable from the date that is six months following the date of issuance through the ten year anniversary of the date of issuance and will be exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Conditional Warrants (the “Conditional Warrant Shares”), in which case the Conditional Warrants shall also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis. In connection with the Loan Agreement, on November 7, 2018, we and the Lenders entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to file one or more registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the purpose of registering for resale the Initial Warrant Shares and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC registering all of the Initial Warrant Shares and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Conditional Warrants for resale by no later than the 45th day following the issuance of the Initial Warrants and the Conditional Warrants, respectively. On December 13, 2018, we filed a registration statement with the SEC registering all of the Initial Warrant Shares for resale, and such registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on December 21, 2018.
Acquired In-process Research and Development of BDL
In August 2015, we and TNK entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with BDL Products, Inc. (“BDL”) and the stockholders of BDL (the “Stockholders”) pursuant to which the Stockholders sold all of their shares of capital stock in BDL to TNK for: (1) a cash payment of $100.00, and (2) $6.0 million in shares of TNK Class A Stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, to be issued to the Stockholders upon a financing resulting in gross proceeds (individually or in the aggregate) to TNK of at least $50.0 million (a “Qualified Financing”).  In accordance with subsequent amendments to the Stock Purchase Agreement, in the event a Qualified Financing did not occur by October 15, 2017 (subject to further extension as implied and based on previously amended dates) or TNK did not complete an initial public offering of shares of its capital stock by September 15, 2017, in lieu of receiving shares of TNK pursuant to the acquisition, the Stockholders would receive an aggregate of 309,916 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. TNK did not complete a Qualified Financing by the financing deadline and we issued 309,916 shares of our common stock to the Stockholders on March 19, 2018.
Sofusa® Acquisition
On July 2, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Sofusa Purchase Agreement”) with Kimberly-Clark Corporation (“KCC”), Kimberly-Clark Global Sales, LLC (“KCCGS”), and Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. (“KCCW” and together with KCC and KCCGS, “Kimberly-Clark”) pursuant to which, among other things, we acquired certain of Kimberly-Clark’s assets related to micro-needle drug delivery system, including the Sofusa® platform (the “Sofusa Assets”) and related fixed assets, and assumed certain of Kimberly-Clark’s liabilities related to the Sofusa Assets (the “Sofusa Acquisition”). The closing of the Sofusa Acquisition (the “Sofusa Closing”) occurred on July 2, 2018. At the Sofusa Closing, we paid $10 million and agreed to pay additional consideration to Kimberly-Clark upon the achievement of certain regulatory and net sales milestones, as well as a percentage in the low double-digits of any non-royalty amounts received by us in connection with any license, sale or other grant of rights by us to develop or commercialize the Sofusa Assets (all such additional consideration, the “Sofusa Contingent Consideration”). Under the Sofusa Purchase Agreement, the aggregate amount of the Sofusa Contingent Consideration payable by us will not exceed $300.0 million. We also agreed to pay Kimberly-Clark a low single-digit royalty on all net sales with respect to the first five products developed by us or our licensees that utilizes intellectual property included in the Sofusa Assets. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since substantially all the value of the gross assets was concentrated in a single asset. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we acquired the Sofusa DoseDisc micro-needle technology designed to increase the efficacy of drug delivery by way of transdermal drug delivery for cash consideration of $10.0 million which was allocated based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired. No contingent consideration was recorded as of December 31, 2018 since the related regulatory approval milestones are not deemed probable until they actually occur. As a result, $9.5 million was expensed as a component of acquired in-process research and development and the remaining $0.5 million was recorded primarily to fixed assets as of December 31, 2018.
Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
12

We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents, is effectively maintained as a trade secret, or is protected by confidentiality agreements. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business.
We have multiple issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions that cover our G-MAB™ technology, G-MAB™-derived antibodies, other proprietary antibody-centric technologies, and pain management compounds, including, but not limited to, the following:

1) | The G-MAB™ discovery antibody library technology. Certain aspects of this technology are covered by issued patents and are the subject matter of pending patent applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2023.


2) | The G-MAB™-derived immuno-oncology antibody candidate portfolio. Certain of these antibody candidates are covered by issued patents and are the subject matter of pending applications and granted patents with potential patent coverage to at least 2033.


3) | The bispecific antibody technology directed to the combination of one or more different monoclonal antibodies or fragments that can target multiple or different antigens. The bispecific antibody technology is the subject matter of pending applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2035.


4) | The ADC technology using proprietary conjugation chemistries (called C-Lock and K-Lock), initially developed by Concortis Biosystems, Corp. ("Concortis"), one of our subsidiaries. This ADC technology is the subject matter of pending patent applications and granted patents with potential patent coverage to at least 2033. Additional pending patent applications directed to different toxin derivatives, are the subject matter of pending applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2035. 


5) | The CAR T-Cell based technology is an immunotherapy platform and is the subject matter of pending patent applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2035. Candidates arising from the platform are the subject matter of pending applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2037.


6) | The CAR adoptive cellular immunotherapy using T cells and NK immune cells is directed to helping a patient’s immune system fight disease, including cancer. We have filed patent applications on the techniques for creating such therapies based on our CAR combination therapies providing with potential patent coverage to at least 2036.


7) | The intracellular targeting antibody (iTAb) technology (LA Cell) for targeting intracellular targets for treating disease is the subject matter of pending patent applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2036. We have filed patent applications on improvements to this technology with potential patent coverage to at least 2038.


8) | The new biosimilar / biobetter antibody technology using manufacture in certain cells (for example, directed to antigen targets such as EGFR or TNF-alpha) is the subject matter of pending patent applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2035.


9) | The RTX (resiniferatoxin)-based pain management technology. Certain aspects of this technology are covered by an issued patent in the U.S. providing patent protection to at least 2021 and are the subject matter of pending patent applications that will provide potential patent coverage to at least 2036.


10) | The lidocaine-based pain management technology was obtained by the acquisition of Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Certain aspects of this technology are covered by several issued U.S. patents, which will not expire until at least 2031. Additional patent applications to improvements of this technology have been filed and have the potential to provide patent coverage to at least 2039 and may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness.


11) | The Sofusa technology was acquired from Kimberly-Clark as a novel technology platform designed to deliver large molecules, such as antibodies, directly into lymphatic capillaries and tumor draining lymph nodes. This micro-epidermal infusion system features a proprietary microneedle array and microfluidics reservoir. The Sofusa technology is the subject of multiple granted and pending applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2037.

13

Certain factors can either extend patent terms or provide other forms of exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity) for varying periods depending on the date of patent filing, date of grant or the legal term of a patent in the various jurisdictions in which patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, also depends upon the type of patent, the scope of claim coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the particular country.
While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interest in any intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and, if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Government Regulations
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;


• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or an NDA to file the NDA for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA or an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.

14

In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal, and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, import and export of materials and products, environmental protection and the use and handling of hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemical compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:

• | Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.


• | Phase II. Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.


• | Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.

A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are also 
15

Phase III trials but may be Phase II trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production, distribution, shipping and storage of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial 
16

resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulations
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Available Special Regulatory Procedures
Formal Meetings
We are encouraged to engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the U.S., there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA.
The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting.
Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials and pharmaco-vigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from health authorities in the U.S. and the European Union, Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) or Protocol Assistance procedures are available. An SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA’s agreement to an SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical trials begin, or if the trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon 
17

with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a trial will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the trial is subject to an SPA.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.  
In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Authorization Procedures in the European Union
Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.

• | Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.


• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

18

Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Accelerated Review (European Union)
Based on results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
There can be no assurance that we or any of our partners would be able to satisfy one or more of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Healthcare Reform Law”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law established:

• | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;


• | A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and


• | A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Healthcare Reform Law, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business

Antibody Clinical Development
We currently focus our research efforts primarily in the identification and isolation of human antibody drug candidates and further characterize these antibody candidates in in vitro and in vivo functional testing. Due to our limited financial resources, we intend to actively seek product development and commercialization partners from the biopharmaceuticals industry to help us advance the clinical development of select product candidates.
Marketing and Sales
With the exception of our subsidiary, Scilex, we currently do not have any sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses or use the services of contract sales organizations ("CROs"), which are equipped to, market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing and sales teams and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
We currently manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. As of December 31, 2018, our Scilex ZTlido® product is manufactured by ITOCHU CHEMICAL FRONTIER Corporation. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in our markets require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMPs. We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 382 employees and 36 consultants and advisors. A significant number of our management and our other employees and consultants have worked or consulted with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future.
None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information
On September 21, 2009, QuikByte Software, Inc., a Colorado corporation and shell company (“QuikByte”), consummated its acquisition of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation and private concern (“STI”), in a reverse merger (the “Merger”). Pursuant to the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of STI common stock were converted into an aggregate of 6,775,032 shares of QuikByte common stock and STI became a wholly owned subsidiary of QuikByte. The holders of QuikByte’s common stock immediately prior to the Merger held an aggregate of 2,228,333 shares of QuikByte’s common stock immediately following the Merger.
We were originally incorporated as San Diego Antibody Company in California in 2006 and were renamed “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.” and reincorporated in Delaware in 2009, prior to the Merger. QuikByte was originally incorporated in Colorado in 1989. Following the Merger, on December 4, 2009, QuikByte reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”). Immediately following the Reincorporation, on December 4, 2009, we merged with and into QuikByte, the separate corporate existence of STI ceased and QuikByte continued as the surviving corporation (the “Roll-Up Merger”). Pursuant to the certificate of merger filed in connection with the Roll-Up Merger, QuikByte’s name was changed from “QuikByte Software, Inc.” to “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.”
