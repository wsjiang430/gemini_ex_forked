Khandwala, the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Winthrop, prior to the Sale, for $6,000,000, subject to certain adjustments for intercompany accounts at closing (the “Sale”).
 
The Sale was approved by the Company’s stockholders on July 16, 2018 at the annual stockholders meeting, and the Sale was completed on July 17, 2018. The Company received $6,000,000 in cash as well as $173,000 from Winthrop for repayment of the intercompany balance between the Company and Winthrop.

Assets and liabilities of Winthrop have been reclassified as held for sale in the December 31, 2017 in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 

Description of the business of the Company after the Sale
 
Following the Sale, we remain a public company. We have and will continue to evaluate and potentially explore all available strategic options. We will continue to work to maximize stockholder value. Such strategic options may include developing or acquiring a majority interest or at least a controlling interest (as defined for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) in a company (or companies) with principal business operations in an industry that we believe will provide attractive opportunities for growth. We are not limited to any particular industry or type of business. The directors will also consider alternatives for distributing some or all of the proceeds to stockholders. Until such time as a decision is made as to how the proceeds from the Sale and other liquid assets of the Company are so deployed, we intend to invest the proceeds and our other liquid assets in high-grade, short-term investments (such as cash and cash equivalents) consistent with the preservation of principal, maintenance of liquidity and avoidance of speculation.
 
After the Sale, the Company had no or nominal operations and, as a result, we are a “shell company”, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a shell company, our stockholders will be unable to utilize Rule 144 of the Securities Act, or Rule 144 to sell “restricted stock” as defined in Rule 144 or otherwise use Rule 144 to sell stock of the Company, and we would be ineligible to utilize registration statements on Form S-3 or Form S-8 for so long as we remain a shell company and for 12 months thereafter. Among other things, as a consequence, the offering, issuance and sale of our securities is likely to be more expensive and time consuming and may make our securities less attractive to investors.
 
We are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the Investment Company Act, a company may fall within the scope of being an “inadvertent investment company” under section 3(a)(1)(C) of such Act if the value of its investment securities (as defined in the Investment Company Act) is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash and certain cash equivalents).

Connecticut Property
 
The Company has interests in land and certain flowage rights in undeveloped property (the “properties”) primarily located in Killingly, Connecticut. As of December 31, 2017, the properties were valued at $355,000 based on an independent valuation. Due to ongoing remediation efforts and no active market to sell the properties, the Company believes the value of the properties is nominal and as such recorded an impairment loss of $355,000. As of December 31, 2018, the properties are shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at $0 after recording an impairment loss of $355,000.
