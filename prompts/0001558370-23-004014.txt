Item 1.     BUSINESS
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of pathogen-specific bacteriophage therapeutics for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacterial infections using our proprietary bacteriophage-based technology. Bacteriophages or “phages” have a powerful and highly differentiated mechanism of action that enables binding to and killing specific bacteria, in contrast to traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics. We

believe that phages represent a promising means to treat bacterial infections, especially those that have developed resistance to current standard of care therapies, including the so-called multidrug-resistant or “superbug” strains of bacteria. We are a leading developer of phage therapeutics and are uniquely positioned to address the growing worldwide threat of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
We are combining our proprietary approach and expertise in identifying, characterizing and developing both naturally-occurring and engineered (synthetic) bacteriophages with our proprietary phage-specific current good manufacturing practice regulations compliant (“cGMP”) manufacturing capabilities to advance a broad pipeline of high-quality bacteriophage product candidates. 
​
We are developing and advancing our lead clinical phage candidate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (“P. aeruginosa”). On October 14, 2020, we received the approval to proceed from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for AP-PA02. In the first quarter of 2023, Armata announced positive topline results from the completed “SWARM-P.a.” study – a Phase 1b/2a, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled AP-PA02 in subjects with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection. Data indicate that AP-PA02 was well-tolerated with a treatment emergent adverse event profile similar to placebo. Pharmacokinetcs (PK) findings confirm that AP-PA02 can be effectively delivered to the lungs through nebulization with minimal systemic exposure, with single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses resulting in a proportional increase in exposure as measured in induced sputum and exposure achievement relatively consistent across patient subjects. Additionally, bacterial levels of P. aeruginosa in the sputum measured at several timepoints suggest improvement in bacterial load reduction for subjects treated with AP-PA02 at the end of treatment as compared to placebo after ten days of dosing. This study is supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”), which granted Armata a Therapeutics Development Award of up to $5.0 million.
​
We are also developing and advancing a phage product candidate for Staphylococcus aureus (“S. aureus”) for the treatment of complicated S. aureus bacteremia, AP-SA02. On June 15, 2020, we entered into an agreement (the “MTEC Agreement”) with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (“MTEC”), pursuant to which we expect to receive a $15.0 million grant and entered into a three-year program administered by the U.S Department of Defense (the “DoD”) through MTEC with funding from the Defense Health Agency and Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. On September 29, 2022, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by $1.3 million to $16.3 million and extend the term into the third quarter of 2024. The grant is being used to partially fund a Phase 1/2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled dose escalation study that will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of our phage-based candidate, AP-SA02, for the treatment of adults with S. aureus bacteremia. On November 17, 2021, Armata announced that it had received from the FDA the approval to proceed for our IND application for AP-SA02. We plan to continue to advance the “diSArm” study provided that the impacts of COVID-19 do not impede our ability to enroll subjects in this clinical trial.
​
On February 22, 2022, Armata announced that it had received from the FDA the approval to proceed for our IND application for AP-PA02, in a second indication, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (“NCFB”). The Company initiated a Phase 2 trial (“Tailwind”) in NCFB in 2022 and reported first patient dosing in the first quarter of 2023. The "Tailwind” study is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, phage kinetics, and efficacy of inhaled AP-PA02 phage therapeutic in subjects with NCFB and chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
​
On August 1, 2022, Armata announced that it had received from the FDA the approval to proceed for our IND application for AP-SA02, in a second indication, prosthetic joint infections (“PJI”). The Company plans to initiate a Phase 1b/2a trial in 2023, which will assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous and intra-articular AP-SA02 as an adjunct to standard of care antibiotics in adults undergoing debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention for the treatment of periprosthetic joint infections caused by S. aureus.
​
We are committed to conducting randomized controlled clinical trials required for FDA approval in order to move toward the commercialization of alternatives to traditional antibiotics and provide a potential method of treating patients suffering from drug-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacterial infections.

Pipeline
The following chart summarizes the status of our phage product candidate development programs and partners. 

Strategy 
Our strategy is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of multiple phage products in randomized controlled clinical trials required for FDA approval and to support commercialization in multiple indications of high unmet medical need, including bacterial infections caused by multidrug-resistant and difficult-to-treat pathogens. Our fully integrated product development capabilities from bench to clinic enable the discovery of optimal product candidates, efficient process development and manufacturing, and rigorous clinical trials. Our microbiological surveillance and synthetic biology capabilities drive long-term product life cycle management. We intend to:

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Need for New Anti-Infective Therapies 
The introduction of penicillin in the early 1940s marked the start of the antibiotic discovery era, during which more than 20 new classes of antibiotic were marketed over a period of three decades. The first case of the “superbug”, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (“MRSA”), in the United States occurred in 1968. A void in the discovery of new classes of antibiotics lasting approximately 30 years drove the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including 

8



vancomycin-resistant enterococci (“VRE”), and pandrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
​
​
The dramatic and continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and the lack of new antibiotics in the pipeline, has prompted calls to action from many of the world’s major health bodies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), and the World Health Organization (the “WHO”), who warn of an “antibiotic cliff” and a “post-antibiotic era.” A growing list of infections – such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, bacteremia/septicemia, gonorrhea, and foodborne diseases – are becoming harder, and sometimes impossible, to treat as antibiotics become less effective. In 2009, the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System concluded that “the loss of effective antimicrobial therapy increasingly threatens the delivery of crucial health services in hospitals and in the community.” This conclusion was reinforced by The Antimicrobial Availability Task Force of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (the “IDSA”), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in conjunction with the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”).
The IDSA and the WHO regard antimicrobial resistance as one of the greatest threats to human health worldwide. The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, a global project commissioned by the British government and the Wellcome Trust, reports that at least 700,000 people die each year of drug resistance in illnesses that include bacterial infections. The report predicts that, by 2050, 10 million lives a year worldwide (more people than currently die from cancer) and a cumulative US$100 trillion of economic output are at risk due to the rise of drug-resistant infections. The CDC estimates that at least 2 million people in the United States develop infections due to resistant bacteria resulting in more than 23,000 deaths each year. A 2018 study from the Washington University School of Medicine indicated that the number of deaths would be between 153,113 and 162,044, which suggests that the CDC estimates may be dramatic underestimations. It is estimated that 50% of hospital-acquired infections are resistant to first-line anti-infective therapies. The cumulative annual healthcare costs for treating drug-resistant bacterial infections in United States alone is calculated at US $21 billion to US $34 billion, with over 8 million additional hospital days. It is for these reasons that we believe there is a critical and pressing need to develop new and novel antibacterial therapies to combat the rise in antibiotic-resistance bacteria.
Anti-Infective Therapeutics Market 
The market opportunity for antibiotics is large, with the market estimated to exceed $58 billion in annual sales globally by 2027. Almost one in every five deaths worldwide occurs as a result of infection and, according to the WHO, many bacterial infections will become difficult or impossible to cure as the efficacy of current standard-of-care 

9



antibiotics wanes. Despite the advances in antimicrobial and vaccine development, infectious diseases still remain the third-leading cause of death in the United States and the second-leading cause of death worldwide.
The number of new antibiotics approved by the FDA, and other global regulatory authorities has declined consistently over the last two decades. According to a March 2021 report from PEW Charitable Trusts, only 43 new antibiotics (all small molecules that act systemically) with the potential to treat serious or life-threatening bacterial infections are in global clinical development. This is compared with more than 1,100 new product candidates in the drug pipeline for cancer. Historically, the success rate from Phase 1 to marketing approval is only one in five for infectious disease products. We, therefore, believe there is a need for new approaches to treat serious and life-threatening bacterial infections.
Hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections are a major healthcare problem throughout the world, affecting developed countries as well as resource-poor countries. The WHO reports that hospital-acquired infections are among the major causes of death and increased morbidity among hospitalized patients and estimates that more than 1.4 million people per year worldwide suffer from infectious complications from a hospital stay. In 2016, the CDC reported that in the United States, approximately 4% of all patients admitted to a hospital will be affected by a hospital-acquired infection during their stay, typically requiring extended stays and additional care.
Compounding the above situations is the alarming and continuing rise in the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. This, coupled with the lack of new antibiotics in current discovery and development pipelines, has generated a significant clinical management problem worldwide, leading to increases in morbidity and mortality due to these antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as increases in healthcare costs.
Bacteriophage therapy has the potential to be an alternative method of treating bacterial infection.
Bacteriophage Therapy 
Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are ubiquitous viruses, found wherever bacteria exist. It is estimated there are more bacteriophages than every other organism on Earth combined. Phages are natural predators of bacteria, and the name “bacteriophage” translates as “eaters of bacteria”. Phages infect and rapidly kill the bacterial host by multiplying inside and then bursting through the cell membrane in order to release the next generation of phages into the surrounding environment, ready to infect and kill additional nearby target bacterial cells until the bacteria have been eliminated. When there are no target bacteria left for the phages to infect, the phages are removed through the body’s natural clearance processes.


10



Phages have the potential to provide both an alternative to, and a synergistic approach with, antibiotic therapy. Phages offer several differentiating attributes compared to classic antibiotics:

● | Highly specific/selective bactericidal agents, sparing the microbiome. Since each strain of phage generally exploits only a particular bacterial host, phages may be a precision tool to reduce or eliminate specific strains of harmful bacteria without exposing patients to risks of eliminating beneficial bacteria through the use of antibiotics. Such risks could include serious opportunistic infections such as Clostridium difficile infection and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (“VRE”) infection.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No known toxicities associated with chemical structures. Antibiotic use is often associated with toxicities (e.g. kidneys, bone marrow, hearing). Phages are highly unlikely to carry structural features or be metabolized by the body to produce structural elements that confer chemical toxicities associated with small molecules.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distinct mechanism of bactericidal action. Since phages use different mechanisms of action, their activity is independent of antibiotic resistance and as such could provide much needed therapy for multi-drug resistant infections.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Replication competent. It is possible that phage replication at the site of infection facilitates effective dosing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High potential for added functionality through genetic engineering. Phage genomes can be modified to confer benefits that address limitations, if any, that are observed during clinical development. Traits such as host range, burst size and biofilm disruption can be improved. These potential improvements help to assure phage therapeutics efficacy in difficult settings and over time as new isolates emerge.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phages were discovered in 1915 at the Pasteur Institute and were shown to kill bacteria taken from patients suffering from dysentery. Furthermore, it was noted that phage numbers rose as patients recovered from infection, suggesting a direct association. Throughout the pre-antibiotic era, phages were widely used as an effective therapeutic agent to combat a variety of bacterial infections. However, phage use was displaced by the common use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the early 1940s, with antibiotics being seen for many years as the superior treatment to combat bacterial disease, particularly in Western medicine. This attitude persisted until the development of the wide-ranging, and in some cases total, resistance to antibiotics seen within the last 10 years. We believe that the continuing emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria provides the opportunity to revitalize phage use.
There are hundreds of cases published in the scientific and medical literature describing the use of phage therapy in human medicine over more than 90 years, mostly in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Phage therapy is still commonly used today in Russia, Poland and Georgia, with numerous reports of success in treating infectious diseases caused by many pathogenic bacterial species. However, the safety and effectiveness of these therapies have not been conclusively established due to the lack of randomized controlled clinical studies.
Recently, Western medicine has seen a rise in the clinical evaluation of phages. In the United Kingdom, two early-stage clinical trials of P. aeruginosa phage cocktails showed no adverse effects in patients. One study (Phase 1/2a) demonstrated efficacy in a small trial of 12 patients with chronic multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa otitis treated with a cocktail of six natural phages. Since 2016, there have been a number of “compassionate use” cases in which patients suffering from various serious or life-threatening infections have been treated with phage therapy under physician-sponsored Emergency Investigational New Drug (“EIND”) Applications with high rates of success and no adverse effects attributable to the therapy. Most notable was the well-documented case in 2016 of Tom Patterson, whose disseminated multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection was successfully treated with phage-based therapeutic cocktails administered intravenously and intraperitoneally. An 82-year-old male with an aortic graft (heart implant) infected with pandrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was successfully treated with a single application of phage, marking Yale University’s first case using phage therapy under Emergency IND. By early 2019, Yale University had treated more than half-a-dozen compassionate use cases, the majority individuals with CF with antibiotic-resistant lung infection. In 2018, a 15-year-old CF patient with a disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus lung infection was treated intravenously with a three-phage cocktail following lung transplantation. That patient’s case represents another milestone for phage therapy – the first person to be treated with genetically modified phages.

11



A consistent takeaway from these early phage therapy uses, and from the more recent clinical trials and compassionate use cases, is that phage therapy is generally well tolerated, with generally no reports of serious adverse events. Phage have previously received approvals for use in cleaning food facilities and as a food additive for human consumption by the FDA and the EMA, and as agricultural bacterial pest treatments by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). Phages have met the criteria to be considered as “generally recognized as safe”, or “GRAS”, in the food and food contact surface categories.
With the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, we believe it is essential that phage safety and efficacy is demonstrated by conducting rigorous well-powered clinical trials required for FDA approval, in order to move toward commercialization of alternatives to traditional antibiotics and bring a potential solution to all patients suffering from drug-resistant bacterial infections.
Target Markets and Medical Need
Pulmonary Bacterial Infections
P. aeruginosa is consistently recognized by the CDC, and other public health agencies, as among the most dangerous and difficult-to-treat pathogens associated with significant impacts on health, quality of life, and economic burden. Regular standard-of-care antibiotics treatments often fail to completely eradicate the pathogen, and the problem is further complicated by rising rates of antibiotic resistance due to a growing number of multidrug-resistant isolates emerging, particularly with long term use. P. aeruginosa is particularly problematic for CF patients given that their already compromised immune system leads to chronic infections. In addition to CF lung infections, P. aeruginosa is responsible for other respiratory infections with high unmet medical need, including NCFB and hospitalized pneumonia. 
P. aeruginosa Infection is a Major Cause of Morbidity and Mortality in Cystic Fibrosis
CF is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene. CF affects over 30,000 people in the United States (70,000 people worldwide) with approximately 1,000 new diagnoses per year. Dysfunction of the CFTR gene leads to dysfunction in multiple organs, but particularly the lungs, where a failure of hydration of airway secretions results in thick mucus, chronic inflammation, airway remodeling, and recurrent infections. Lung function continues to decline over time, punctuated by pulmonary exacerbations with increased cough, shortness of breath, and infections that result in rapid declines in lung function. For these reasons, CF remains the most common fatal hereditary lung disease.
Outcomes for people with CF have improved significantly in recent years through early screening, the development and use of CFTR modulators, and other therapies. However, people with CF still suffer significant morbidity and mortality due to pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa. Chronic P. aeruginosa infections occur in 55% of CF patients by age 25, and are strongly associated with worsening lung function, frequent pulmonary exacerbations, and increased mortality. In 2018, the median survival age was 47 years. Although many patients with chronic P. aeruginosa benefit from routine suppressive inhaled antibiotic therapy, large numbers of CF patients still experience clinical deterioration despite these treatments, hence the need for more effective therapies, ideally with a different mechanism of action compared to traditional antibiotics, for the treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa infection. GlobalData projects that total antibiotic sales in the CF market will exceed $400 million in 2020.
Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis
NCFB is a chronic respiratory disease affecting more than 100,000 people in the United States and 200,000 people in Europe, characterized by recurrent respiratory infections that lead to a vicious cycle of impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic infection, bronchial inflammation, and progressive lung function loss. P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent pathogen responsible for these recurrent infections. It is found in approximately 30% of cases and is associated with enhanced disease progression, including poorer lung function and lower quality of life, more frequent exacerbations, 7-fold increase in hospitalizations, and 3-fold increase in death. NCFB patients frequently become chronically colonized with multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa because of the need for repeated courses of 

12



antibiotic treatment. There are currently no approved inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of NCFB patients with chronic P. aeruginosa respiratory infections.
Hospitalized Pneumonia
Hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilated-associated pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death among all hospital‐acquired infections, with approximately 300,000 hospitalization each year in the United States due to Pseudomonas. Infection with Pseudomonas results in mortality rates ranging as high as 35‐50%, drives considerable healthcare costs (in excess of $40,000 per patient), and accounts for around 50% of all intensive care unit antibiotics. 
Staphylococcus aureus Infections
Bacteremia
Bacteremia is a bacterial infection of the bloodstream. A common diagnosis, the CDC estimates that up to 1.7 million people in the U.S. develop bacteremia each year. S. aureus is the most commonly identified pathogen in both hospital- and community-acquired bloodstream infections. Annually in the U.S. there are approximately 200,000 hospitalizations for S. aureus bacteremia (“SAB”). Despite conventional antibiotics, mortality in SAB results in the death of up to 40% of all cases and 57% of patients over the age of 85. Patients with comorbidities such as alcoholism, malignancy, diabetes, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and immunosuppression are at even higher risk for death when SAB develops. Age-adjusted mortality assessments show that SAB mortality is higher than that of AIDS, tuberculosis, or viral hepatitis, and comparable to mortality rates for breast or prostate cancer. Outcomes are even poorer for SAB due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (“MRSA”), classified as a serious threat to global health by the CDC and a high priority threat by the WHO, with higher rates of complications and increased mortality as compared to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (“MSSA”). Average hospital costs to patients with nosocomial SAB ranges between $40,000 (MSSA) and $114,000 (MRSA). Treatment failures are common in SAB, with highest rates due to MRSA. These failures can be attributed in part to poor penetration of some tissues by antibiotics, slow onset of bactericidal effects, emerging resistance patterns, and biofilm formation. While biofilms can render traditional antibiotics ineffective, phages may have the ability to penetrate the biofilm allowing rapid and efficient infection of the host and amplification at the site of infection. Daptomycin (approved in 2005; based on clinical cure rates of less than 50%) and vancomycin are the only two antibiotics with label indications in the U.S. for the treatment of SAB, and the emergence of drug-resistant S. aureus isolates, including to these two standard of care drugs, represents a major threat in terms of increasing morbidity, mortality and health care utilization.
Prosthetic Joint Infection
The total number of prosthetic joint infection (“PJI”)-related revision surgeries is expected to more than double from 70,000 in 2020 to 144,000 in 2040 in the United States and European Union Five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom), at an annual growth rate of 5.6% due to a growing elderly population. The United States is the largest market for PJI, accounting for 61% of PJI-related revision surgery in 2020 (estimated to be 71% by 2040) each estimated to cost $150,000. S. aureus PJI infections are among the most commonly observed, accounting for up to 47% of all infections. PJI caused by biofilm-forming bacteria, such as S. aureus, is challenging to treat and requires both surgery and long-term antibiotic use. Lack of efficacy against biofilms is a common cause of re-infection or treatment failure in PJI. Moreover, growing antibiotic resistance complicates treatment strategies and antibiotic choice for the treatment of PJI. Phage therapy has been successful in patients who have failed conventional antibiotic treatment, including two 2020 case studies in which phage were administered by intravenous or intraarticular routes and shown to be generally well tolerated. 
Platform Technologies
Synthetic Phage Platform
Phages, natural predators of bacteria, have been in an uninterrupted battle for millions of years – evolving to kill or evade. These powerful natural phages can be purposely engineered to be more efficient killers. The use of synthetic 

13



biology tools enables us to precisely engineer natural phages in ways that further improve their pharmacological properties and antimicrobial activity. Attributes of engineered phages can include expanded host range, improved potency which is a fundamental drug property that can translate into improved clinical efficacy, and importantly, biofilm disruption, which is a critical aspect of serious infections that needs to be addressed.

​
Preclinical and Clinical Development Programs
Overview
We are committed to developing novel phage therapies, with drug development expertise and product development capabilities that span bench to clinic, including in-house phage-specific cGMP manufacturing. Our phage discovery platform in which we screen panels of clinically-relevant isolates against our extensive phage library utilizing proprietary methods that identify phage combinations with superior attributes, together with our phage-specific cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities, uniquely enables us to efficiently identify optimal product candidates. Our microbiological surveillance and synthetic biology capabilities drive long-term product life cycle management.
Our therapeutic phage candidates aim to address areas of significant unmet medical need, by targeting key drug-resistant bacteria, including those on the WHO’s global priority pathogens list, and the priority pathogens list issued by the CDC. The long-term potential for phage therapy is broad reaching, including potential use as front-line therapy. However, first indications will be as adjunct therapy in indications with high unmet need, which demands careful patient population selection to assure that a treatment effect with the phage cocktail can be observed over and above the efficacy of standard-of-care antibiotics. 
We are developing and advancing a broad pipeline of natural and synthetic phage candidates, including clinical candidates for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, two bacterial pathogens known to have significant morbidity and mortality despite standard-of-care antibiotic usage. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are causative agents for difficult-to-treat infections: P. aeruginosa, with its mucoid and multidrug-resistant strains, is a dominant culprit in chronic respiratory infections in CF and NCFB patients as well as acute pneumonias in hospitalized patients; S. aureus, with its heteroresistant and MRSA strains, has been implicated in systemic (e.g., bacteremia) as well as prosthetic-related 

14



infections. By advancing randomized controlled clinical trials using P. aeruginosa and S. aureus natural phage cocktails, Armata will gain experience treating site-specific as well as systemic infections. 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Phage Product Candidate, AP-PA02
Historical Background 
AP-PA02 is being developed as a next-generation replacement for AP-PA01 (previously known as AB-PA01). A total of 10 patients with serious or life-threatening P. aeruginosa infections not responding to antibiotic therapy were treated with AP-PA01, along with antibiotics, under single-patient expanded access programs in the United States (authorized under Emergency INDs by the FDA) and in Australia (authorized under the Special Access Scheme by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration). The treated patients’ infections included bacteremia, native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, recurrent pneumonia (CF, post-transplant), ventilated-associated pneumonia, prosthetic joint infection, ventricular assist device infection, and septicemia due to burns. Investigators concluded that intravenous and nebulized administration of AP-PA01 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. One of these cases was published in August 2019, in the peer-reviewed journal Infection, after AP-PA01 was used to successfully treat a CF patient who had developed a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection. Another success with AP-PA01, used to treat a 77-year-old with ventilated-associated pneumonia and empyema, was published in November 2019, in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. We no longer offer AP-PA01 through any expanded access program.
In August 2018, we held a Type B pre-IND meeting with the U.S. FDA regarding a proposed Phase 1/2 clinical study of AP-PA01 for the treatment of P. aeruginosa respiratory infections (ventilated-associated pneumonia). Feedback from the FDA in September 2018 included: agreement on product specifications, manufacturing and analytical plan, and a stability program. Furthermore, the FDA noted that preclinical toxicology studies are not required for AP-PA01 to enter clinical development.
Human exposure through treatment of single patients with AP-PA01 under the expanded access program has been helpful in demonstrating the promise of phage therapy. Feedback from the pre-IND meeting has been insightful for the regulatory path required for phage therapeutics in general, and specifically for a phage product candidate intended for respiratory infection. We, therefore, have leveraged our experiences with AP-PA01 to derive a development plan for the next-generation product candidate, AP-PA02.
Preclinical Development of AP-PA02
AP-PA02 is one example of the novel candidates to emerge from our robust research and development capabilities, and significantly improves upon our original P. aeruginosa phage product candidate, AP-PA01. The phages that comprise AP-PA02 were selected with desired attributes for a product candidate targeting P. aeruginosa lung infections. Different methods were deployed, including microbiological, bioinformatics and comparative genomics, in order to identify optimal attributes for the product candidate. Susceptibility, killing kinetics, and biofilm eradication, was assessed using P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients to determine antimicrobial activity and potency of AP-PA02. Viability in relevant biological fluids, and compatibility with current standard of care therapies for CF patients was verified to confirm suitability of AP-PA02 for clinical use in this patient population. Immune stimulation was assessed to assure the lack of inflammatory impact by AP-PA02. Animal studies were conducted to provide insight into safe and efficacious dose levels that would support the expectation of pharmacological activity (i.e. antimicrobial potential of phage) in the lung compartment following an inhaled route of administration. In parallel, we initiated manufacturing feasibility and process optimization efforts with the goal of achieving high-quality phage product free of endotoxin and host cell proteins whilst maintaining adequate phage titers. 
AP-PA02 is comprised of a cocktail of natural P. aeruginosa phages originating from distinct families and subfamilies, targeting multiple receptor classes, functioning with compatibility (i.e., the phages don’t interfere with one another) and cooperativity (i.e., the phages work together for a better outcome), and further characterized by being highly potent and having a broad host range and overlap. Prior to initiating the SWARM-P.a. trial (described below), our clinical isolate screening and phage collections yielded a three-phage AP-PA02 cocktail with compelling host-range 

15



coverage. We subsequently modified AP-PA02 to include additional phage genera that increase potency and broaden coverage of strains of P. aeruginosa found in CF patients. The optimized five-phage AP-PA02 cocktail provides coverage against at least 90% of tested CF clinical isolates and has shown superior in vitro potency as well as improved efficacy in an animal model of infection. The improvements in AP-PA02 reflect our core strategy of utilizing clinical isolate surveillance data to drive enhancement of product composition. 

Preclinical highlights of AP-PA02 include:

● | Significantly reduced P. aeruginosa biofilm mass in vitro;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Persistence of active phage particles in the lung;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Limited systemic and off-target organ distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Significantly decreased mortality in a murine model of acute P. aeruginosa lung infection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Components are stable in blood and sputum;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Not antagonistic with tobramycin nor aztreonam; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Components maintain activity in the presence of other CF therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

We have developed AP-PA02 as a sterile liquid formulation, suitable for delivery by inhalation. Clinical trial material of AP-PA02 is currently manufactured under cGMP at our production facility in Marina del Rey, California.
Clinical Development of AP-PA02 in Cystic Fibrosis
AP-PA02 product candidate is currently in clinical development. On October 14, 2020, Armata received approval for the study to proceed from the FDA for its IND to initiate the “SWARM-P.a.” study – a Phase 1b/2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and phage recovery profile of AP-PA02 administered by inhalation in subjects with cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Primary Endpoints (SAD and MAD) will include incidence and severity of treatment-emergent, adverse events. Secondary Endpoints (MAD) will include changes in P. aeruginosa colony-forming units (“CFU”). We will look at clinical parameters as a part of exploratory endpoints for the SAD and MAD cohorts. The enhanced five-phage AP-PA02 cocktail (described above) was advanced through manufacturing and regulatory review for introduction into the MAD component of the SWARM-P.a. study. The SWARM-P.a. study is supported by the CFF, which in March 2020 granted us a Therapeutics Development Award of up to $5.0 million.

16



In the first quarter of 2023, Armata announced positive topline results from the completed “SWARM-P.a.” study – a Phase 1b/2a, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled AP-PA02 in subjects with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) and chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection. Data indicate that AP-PA02 was well-tolerated with a treatment emergent adverse event profile similar to placebo. Pharmacokinetcs (PK) findings confirm that AP-PA02 can be effectively delivered to the lungs through nebulization with minimal systemic exposure, with single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses resulting in a proportional increase in exposure as measured in induced sputum and exposure achievement relatively consistent across patient subjects. Additionally, bacterial levels of P. aeruginosa in the sputum measured at several timepoints suggest improvement in bacterial load reduction for subjects treated with AP-PA02 at the end of treatment as compared to placebo after ten days of dosing.
With positive outcomes from this first study, SWARM-P.a., we plan to initiate follow-on studies that will investigate the efficacy of AP-PA02 in chronically-infected patients and potentially other CF patient populations. Our ultimate goal is to bring AP-PA02 to the CF community at large as a new FDA-approved novel therapy to treat airway P. aeruginosa infections and improve the long-term health of people with CF.
Exploring Additional Clinical Indications for Our P. aeruginosa Phage Product Candidates
Screening P. aeruginosa isolates from people diagnosed with NCFB revealed that the five-phage AP-PA02 cocktail offers broad coverage and robust potency in this indication as well. On February 22, 2022, Armata announced that it had received from the FDA the approval to proceed for our IND application for AP-PA02, in a second indication, NCFB. The Company initiated a Phase 2 trial (“Tailwind”) in NCFB in 2022 and reported first patient dosing in the first quarter of 2023. The "Tailwind” study is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, phage kinetics, and efficacy of inhaled AP-PA02 phage therapeutic in subjects with NCFB and chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
​
Conversely and representing the different physiology of acute pneumonia lung infections as compared to chronic CF and NCFB respiratory infections, a novel cocktail is in development for the clinical indication of acute hospitalized pneumonia. We have deployed our extensive clinical isolate collection and phage library to identify a candidate phage cocktail, AP-PA03.
Staphylococcus aureus Phage Product Candidate, AP-SA02
Historical Background
AP-SA02 is being developed as a more advanced version of AP-SA01 (previously known as AB-SA01).
The therapeutic potential of AP-SA01 has been demonstrated through:

● | Efficacy in murine methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus pneumonia models, and sheep sinus biofilm model
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstration of safety and tolerability in two completed investigator-initiated Phase 1 studies (topical administration: intact skin of healthy adults; intrasinal administration: patients suffering from S. aureus-derived chronic rhinosinusitis).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More recently, AP-SA01 was provided for use under single-patient expanded access programs in the United States (Emergency INDs, per the Food and Drug Administration) or Australia (Special Access Scheme, per the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration). A total of 18 patients with serious or life-threatening S. aureus infections (including bacteremia, endocarditis, ventricular-assist device infection, prosthetic joint infection) not responding to standard-of-care antibiotic therapy were treated with AP-SA01. AP-SA01 was administered intravenously, with most patients treated for 14 days, every 12 hours as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17




Investigators concluded that intravenous administration of AP-SA01 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. We no longer offer AP-SA01 through any expanded access program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human exposure through treatment of single patients with AP-SA01 under the expanded access program has been helpful in demonstrating the promise of phage therapy and warrants further study to support safety and efficacy through randomized controlled trials required to support registration. Feedback from a Type B pre-IND meeting with the FDA in August 2018 has been insightful for the regulatory path required for phage therapeutics in general, and specifically for a phage product candidate intended for systemic delivery. We therefore have leveraged our experiences with AP-SA01 to derive a development plan for AP-SA02.
Product Optimization: Development of AP-SA02
AP-SA02 is a novel biologic product candidate comprised of a cocktail of natural lytic phages that target the problematic pathogen, S. aureus. 
Preclinical highlights of AP-SA02 include:

● | Potent antimicrobial activity against approximately 95% of S. aureus clinical isolates tested, including drug-resistant isolates (MRSA: methicillin-resistant S. aureus and VRSA: vancomycin-resistant S. aureus);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unique mechanism of action offers synergistic or additive benefit with standard of care antibiotics;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Component phages are stable and retain infectivity after exposure to relevant biological fluids;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Penetrates pre-existing S. aureus biofilms.
--+--------------------------------------------

We have developed AP-SA02 as a sterile solution, suitable for delivery by intravenous administration. Clinical trial material of AP-SA02 is currently manufactured under cGMP at our production facility in Marina del Rey, California to support the required regulatory filing(s) for clinical entry in the United States and ex-U.S. 
Clinical Development of AP-SA02 in Bacteremia
On November 17, 2021, Armata received approval for the study to proceed from the FDA for its IND to initiate the “diSArm” study – a Phase 1b/2a, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multiple ascending dose escalation study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intravenous AP‐SA02 as an adjunct to best available antibiotic therapy compared to best available antibiotic therapy alone for the treatment of adults with bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus. The objectives of this study are to: (i) demonstrate safety and tolerability of multiple different dose levels of AP-SA02; (ii) evaluate optimal dosing through safety, pharmacokinetics and microbial efficacy; and (iii) explore efficacy through evaluation of key meaningful endpoints. The study will be conducted at sites in the United States and also at sites abroad. 
​
The Phase 1b/2a study will be partially funded by a $15.0 million award from the DoD through MTEC with funding from the Defense Health Agency and Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. On September 29, 2022, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by $1.3 million to $16.3 million and extend the term into the third quarter of 2024.
Data from this Phase 1b/2a study will be invaluable for a follow-on trial that will be designed to demonstrate of efficacy of AP-SA02 in treating S. aureus bacteremia. We anticipate findings from this Phase 1b/2a study will provide the basis for constructing a robust trial strategy for registration which can be the basis for an End-of-Phase-2 meeting with the FDA that enables us to obtain agreement on a path to approval.
​

18



Additional Clinical Indications for AP-SA02
Improved patient outcomes are needed for other Staphylococcal infections, in settings such as PJI, for which antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern. We believe AP-SA02 could also have a meaningful impact in this indication, particularly PJIs caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (“MRSA”). On August 1, 2022, we announced that we had received from the FDA the approval to proceed for our IND application for AP-SA02, in a second indication, PJI. We plan to initiate a Phase 1b/2a trial in 2023, which will assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous and intra-articular AP-SA02 as an adjunct to standard of care antibiotics in adults undergoing debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention for the treatment of periprosthetic joint infections caused by S. aureus.
​
Discovery Research
In addition to developing our more advanced pipeline programs described above, we continue phage discovery efforts by screening other interesting bacterial targets against our phage library in order to further expand our pipeline. Klebsiella pneumoniae phage, for example, is a potentially important addition to treatment options for serious lung infections.
Furthermore, our team of microbiologists and synthetic biologists hunt for natural phages and evaluate the suitability of these natural phages for engineering using our synthetic phage platform. These powerful natural phages can be purposely engineered to be more efficient killers. The use of synthetic biology tools enables us to precisely engineer natural phages in ways that further improve their pharmacological properties and antimicrobial activity. Attributes of engineered phages can include expanded host range, improved potency which is a fundamental drug property that can translate into improved clinical efficacy, and importantly, biofilm disruption, which is a critical aspect of serious infections that needs to be addressed. 
Manufacturing 
We produce clinical quantities of each of our bacteriophage product candidates at our cGMP-compliant manufacturing facility in Marina del Rey, California. This facility, which serves as our headquarters, has approximately 35,500 square feet of laboratory and office space, including 3,000 square feet of cGMP laboratory space, designed to produce clinical quantities of each of our product candidates and to perform in-house Quality Control testing. We operate in-house process development activities through to the production, purification, formulation, and release of our therapeutic phage cocktails for use in human clinical trials. Our facility is licensed by the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) for drug manufacturing and is subject to periodic, unannounced inspections for compliance with cGMP and other state and federal laws and regulations. The facility is subject to periodic inspections by the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County for fire hazard and waste management and is in compliance with all applicable regulations. Our facility is staffed with an independent Quality Unit and Manufacturing and Facilities personnel trained under cGMPs. 
Our current formulations for our P. aeruginosa and S. aureus phage product candidates are intended for inhaled and intravenous delivery, both requiring our drug products to be sterile. Our Marina del Rey facility is capable of manufacturing sterile drug products, utilizing ISO-certified cleanrooms and ISO 5-certified biological safety cabinets. The facility also houses an ISO 5-certified closed system isolator. We may further optimize future formulations of our product candidates which may or may not require assurance of sterility.
For our manufacturing facility we have been able to access and hire highly skilled process development and phage manufacturing expertise and believe that we have control of our proprietary platform from phage identification through final product fill and finish and release. Manufacturing campaigns are managed by a specialist team of our internal staff, which is designed to promote compliance with the technical aspects and regulatory requirements of the manufacturing process. We have developed a cGMP-compliant manufacturing process that utilizes both industry standard and proprietary methods for the manufacture of our product candidates. Our process is designed to be scalable to meet our clinical study needs, and to fulfill the requirements of regulators for human studies.

19



Although our facility is capable of manufacturing our phage product candidates, we rely on, and may continue to rely on, third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of certain raw materials, components, or packaging of the product candidates that may be developed for clinical testing, as well as for commercialization.
Intellectual Property 
General
Our goal is to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary processes and know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and contractual obligations with third parties to protect our interests and to develop and maintain our competitive position. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into agreements with contractual obligations that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Our success in preserving market exclusivity for our product candidates relies on patent protection, including extensions to this where appropriate, and on data exclusivity relating to an approved biologic. This may be extended by orphan drug and/or pediatric use protection where appropriate. Once any regulatory period of data exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing and selling biosimilar versions of our product candidates. We are also dependent upon the diligence of our appointed agents in national jurisdictions, acting for and on our behalf, which manage the prosecution of pending domestic and foreign patent applications and maintain granted domestic and foreign patents.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter, and we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) to determine priority of invention.
Bacteriophage Patent Portfolio
As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had exclusive license rights to a total of 144 patents and applications: 12 U.S. patents, 9 U.S. patent applications, 69 foreign patents, and 54 foreign patent applications, with nominal expiration on various dates between 2024 and 2041. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. We believe these patents and applications cover our lead phage therapeutic programs and use thereof, synthetic phage and methods of manufacture thereof, beneficial effects of bacteriophage treatment, bacteriophage combinations, the sequential use of bacteriophages in combination with conventional antibiotics, genetic sequence variations, methods to reduce antibiotic resistance, methods to design therapeutic combination panels of bacteriophage, disinfection methods using bacteriophages, and bacteriophage mutants having increased bacterial host spectra.

20



Competition 
The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions all seeking to develop novel treatment modalities for bacterial infections. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in antibacterial research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our collective experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:

● | discover and develop medicines that are differentiated from other products in the market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain patent and/or proprietary protection for our products and technologies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


● | obtain a commercial partner;
--+-----------------------------


● | commercialize our drugs, if approved; and
--+------------------------------------------


● | attract and retain high-quality research, development and commercial personnel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key factors affecting the success of any approved product include its efficacy, safety profile, drug interactions, method of administration, pricing, reimbursement and level of promotional activity relative to those of competing drugs.
The majority of phage companies are focused on aspects outside of human health such as agriculture, food, environmental, veterinary, biocontrol, manufacturing, and diagnostics. There are a handful of small biotechnology companies developing bacteriophage products to treat human diseases. To our knowledge, several biotechnology companies in the United States and Europe, including Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, Pherecydes Pharma, BiomX Inc., Intralytix, Inc., Locus Biosciences, Inc., TechnoPhage, SA, Felix Biotechnology, as well as academic institutions, have discovery stage or clinical programs utilizing naturally occurring phages or synthetic biology approaches to genetically modify bacteriophages to remove or input genes to improve therapeutic properties such as increases to the bacterial host range to infect a larger number of bacterial strains and decrease the need for using multiple phages in a product.
Our bacteriophage programs may compete with or be synergistic with currently approved antibiotics, and experimental approaches such as novel antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, antimicrobial vaccines, metals, antisense, monoclonal antibodies and possibly microbiome manipulation.
Sales and Marketing
We have full worldwide commercial rights to all of our phage-based product candidates to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections, including our product candidates: AP-PA02 and AP-PA03 for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections, and AP-SA02 for the treatment of S. aureus infections. We believe we can maximize the value of our company by retaining substantial global commercialization rights to these product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into partnerships to develop and commercialize these product candidates.
We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure because our lead candidates are still in early clinical development. Subject to receiving marketing approvals, or earlier we intend to either partner the commercial rights to our products with existing companies that have the wherewithal and resources to commercialize 

21



explore building the necessary marketing and sales infrastructure to market and sell our current product candidates. We also intend to explore the use of a variety of distribution agreements and commercial partnerships in those territories where we do not establish a sales force for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
Material Agreements 
Strategic Alliances and Research Agreements
MTEC Grant
On June 15, 2020, we entered into a Research Project Award agreement (the “MTEC Agreement”) with MTEC, pursuant to which we will receive a $15.0 million grant and entered into a three-year program administered by the DoD through MTEC with funding from the Defense Health Agency and Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. On September 29, 2022, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by $1.3 million to $16.3 million and extend the term into the third quarter of 2024. We plan to use the grant to partially fund a Phase 1b/2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation clinical study of Armata's therapeutic phage-based candidate, AP-SA02, for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia infections. The MTEC Agreement specifies that the grant will be paid to us through a cost reimbursable model, based on agreed-upon cost-share percentages, and the grant money received is not refundable to MTEC.
Upon license or commercialization of intellectual property developed with the funding from the MTEC Agreement, additional fees will be due to MTEC. We will elect whether to (a) pay a fixed royalty amount, which is subject to a cap based upon total funding received, or (b) pay an additional assessment fee, which would also be subject to a cap based upon a percentage of total funding received.
The MTEC Agreement will be effective through October 30, 2024. The MTEC Agreement may be terminated in whole or in part, 30 calendar days following the written notice from either party. In addition, MTEC has the right to terminate the MTEC Agreement upon material breach by Armata. 
CFF Therapeutics Development Award
On March 13, 2020, we entered into an award agreement (the “Award Agreement”) with the CFF, pursuant to which we received a Therapeutics Development Award of up to $5.0 million (the “Award”). The Award will be used to fund a portion of our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of the P. aeruginosa phage candidate, AP-PA02, as a treatment for P. aeruginosa airway infections in people with CF.

The first payment under the AwardAgreement, in the amount of $1.0 million, became due upon signing the Award Agreement and was received in April 2020. The remainder of the award will be paid to us incrementally in installments upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the development program and progress of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AP-PA02, as set forth in the Award Agreement.
​
If we cease to use commercially reasonable efforts directed to the development of AP-PA02, or any other Product (as defined in the Award Agreement), for a period of 360 days (an “Interruption”) and fail to resume the development of the Product after receiving from CFF notice of an Interruption, then we must either repay the amount of the Award actually received by the Company, plus interest, or grant to CFF (1) an exclusive (even as to Armata), worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable license under technology developed under the Award Agreement that covers the Product for use in treating infections in CF patients (the “CF Field”), and (2) a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, sublicensable license under certain background intellectual property covering the Product, to the extent necessary to commercialize the Product in the CF Field.

Upon our commercialization of any Product, we will owe a fixed royalty amount to CFF, which is to be paid in installments determined, in part, based on commercial sales volumes of the Product. We will be obligated to make an additional fixed royalty payment upon achieving specified sales milestones. We may also be obligated to make a 

22



payment to CFF if we transfer, sell or license the Product in the CF Field, or if we enter into a change of control transaction.
​
 The term of the Award Agreement commenced on March 10, 2020 and expires on the earlier of the date on which we have paid CFF all of the fixed royalty payments set forth therein, the effective date of any license granted to CFF following an Interruption, or upon earlier termination of the Award Agreement. Either CFF or Armata may terminate the Award Agreement for cause, which includes our material failure to achieve certain development milestones. Our payment obligations survive the termination of the Award Agreement.
​
License Agreements
Amended and Restated Research Collaboration and Option to License Agreement with Merck 
Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Research and Option to License Agreement (the “Research and Option Agreement”), entered into by and between us and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”), we are engaged in generating broad host range synthetic bacteriophage candidate(s) targeting an undisclosed infectious disease agent(s), pursuant to the criteria set forth in the research plan.
We granted to Merck an exclusive, worldwide license in our patent rights, and our interest in any joint patent rights, with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, for any and all uses of any product candidates, or products, developed through the research plans set forth in the Research and Option Agreement in a specific field of use. Further, in exchange for milestone payments associated with product development and regulatory achievements and royalty payments based on net sales of products developed, we granted to Merck an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses, in our background intellectual property and know-how, solely to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell (but not genetically modify) the product candidates, or products, developed through the research plans set forth in the Research and Option Agreement in the specific field of use.
On December 14, 2022, Armata received a notice of termination for the Research and Option Agreement, which will be effective in March 14, 2023, in accordance with Section 8.2.1 of the Research and Option Agreement which calls for termination effective 90 days after receipt of written notice to terminate.
License Agreement with United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Department of Health
In January 2011, upon completion of our acquisition of Biocontrol Ltd., we assumed a license agreement entered into in March 2007 between Biocontrol Ltd. and the Health Protection Agency, Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response, to use certain intellectual property rights to develop treatments for bacterial biofilm infections. The agreement was subsequently assigned to the United Kingdom Secretary of State for the Department of Health (“DoH”).
Under the license agreement, we have obtained exclusive rights to a patent portfolio related to the use of bacteriophages combined with biofilm-disrupting agents in treating biofilm infections. In consideration for the exclusive license, we may be required to pay to the DoH certain milestone payments in the aggregate of up to £10,000 per product, as well as single digit percentage royalty on net sales of products incorporating licensed intellectual property.
The license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last patent exclusively licensed under the license agreement. If we default on any milestone or royalty payments, or upon breach by us of certain other terms of the license agreement, the DoH may either terminate the license agreement immediately upon written notice or modify the license to be non-exclusive upon 30 days’ written notice.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs.
Legal Proceedings
In addition, from time to time, we are a party to certain litigation that is either judged to be not material or that arises in the ordinary course of business. We intend to vigorously defend our interests in these matters. We expect that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings.
As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not subject to any material legal proceedings.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety, efficacy, purity, and/or potency must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority where the product is intended to be marketed.
United States Product Development Process
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply 

24



with the applicable FDA requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practice requirements (“GLP”) or other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must be granted before human clinical trials may begin in the United States or internationally if submitting results to the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use or uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a new biological product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA’s approval of the BLA which must occur before a biological product can be marketed or sold in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources even when approvals are inherently uncertain.
The strategies, nature, and technologies of bacteriophage products are different from those of conventional antibiotic therapy products. From the regulatory requirements established to ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of bacteriophage preparations, there are several major points to consider during the development, manufacturing, characterization, preclinical study and clinical trial of bacteriophage products. The major issues include:

● | Phage preparation design (single agent versus phage mixes and wild-type phage versus genetically engineered phage);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proof of concept in development of phage products;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Selectivity of bacteriophage replication and targeting to specific species of bacteria;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Relevant animal models in preclinical studies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical safety and efficacy.
--+------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and IND
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the biological product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product biology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the biological product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices described in 21 CFR Part 58 (GLP). The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party CROs to administer and conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards could adversely impact the subject product development program and we remain legally responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing the conduct of these clinical trials.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested primarily for safety and dosage tolerance. Absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion may also be tested. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for approval of a marketing application. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be requested by the FDA as a condition of approval and are conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.

26



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted annually to the FDA and written safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest that there may be a significant risk for human subjects. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s or ethics committee’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Suspension of a clinical trial due to safety risks attributed to the investigational product will result in termination of the trial and possibly others that are underway.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or other impurities with the use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review and Approval Processes
In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate for the proposed indication must be submitted to the FDA. The application includes all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling, among other things. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews it to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical 

27



trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates or those that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation for a biologic must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the rare disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval. Additionally, the sponsor can benefit from certain financial incentives, including opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, research and development tax credits, and user fee waivers. If the same drug has already been approved, the proposed drug needs to demonstrate clinical superiority to obtain orphan exclusivity for the same indication, such as by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues.
Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if 

28



changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Limited Population, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biological products to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or if the drug or biological product qualifies as a qualified infectious disease product under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”). The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapies based on efficacy or safety factors. We intend to request Fast Track designation for our product candidates if applicable.
Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review, accelerated approval, and, as of 2018, for antibacterial and antifungal therapies, approval under the Limited Population Pathway. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or if there is a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefits, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The limited population pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs or biologics (“LPAD”) may enable the streamlined development of safe and effective medicines that overcome the unmet needs of a limited population of patients with serious bacterial infections.
As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug or biological product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval and approval under LPAD pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Approval under LPAD is for a limited population of patients; labeling statements for the limited use of the product are removed when supplemental data substantiates expansion of the patient population.

29



Eligibility for a drug or biologic product to be licensed under LPAD includes treatment of a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet medical need. FDA also considers the severity, rarity or prevalence of the infection and the lack of alternative treatment in the limited population the therapeutic is intended for. It is possible for qualifying therapies to complete a streamlined clinical program to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness and safety in the limited population. Drugs or biological products approved under LPAD can also receive fast track and breakthrough designations as well as accelerated and priority review of the marketing application. LPAD-required limitations of labeling are removed when supplemental data demonstrating a favorable benefit-risk profile in a broader population corroborates label expansion. We intend to request approval under LPAD in the BLA for our product candidates if applicable.
A sponsor can also request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biological products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biological product or drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. We intend to request “breakthrough therapy” designation for our product candidates if applicable.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of new products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We may rely on third parties for the production of commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. We and third-party manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMPs, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA requirements. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, by us or our suppliers, may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. In addition, 

30



changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Labeling, Marketing and Promotion
The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs and biological products, including direct-to-consumer advertising, promotional activities involving the internet, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a product that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market a product only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States (“U.S.”), the base term is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009: Biosimilars and Interchangeable Biologic Products
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 amended the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of “generic” biologics — biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year data exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however, if pediatric clinical trials are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year data exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.

31



An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity and may be available if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA (the “Written Request”). If the Written Request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials.
Diagnostics
We may employ companion diagnostics to help us to more accurately identify patients within a particular bacterial strain, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates that we are developing or may in the future develop. Companion diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”) approval or is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the labeling of the therapeutic product.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute the products, if any, for which we obtain approval. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

32




property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom receive stock options as compensation for services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for 

34



drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMM”) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Since its enactment, there have been a number of significant changes to the ACA. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”), includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device exercise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace or modify elements of the Affordable Care Act. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal, replacement or further modification could have on our business. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.
In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.

Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials of drug products as well as the approval, manufacture and distribution of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Clinical Trials
Certain countries outside of the United States have a regulatory process similar to the U.S. process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to the national health authority and an independent ethics committee in each country in which the trial is to be conducted, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive (and corresponding national laws of the member states) and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed. A similar process to the one described for the European Union is required in Israel for initiation of clinical trials. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Approval Process
In order to market our products, we must obtain a marketing approval for each product and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing in comparison to the testing carried out for the U.S. approval. The time required to obtain approval in foreign countries may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally is subject to all of the same risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country.
To obtain marketing approval of a medicinal product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”), under either a centralized or a decentralized procedure. The decentralized procedure is based on a collaboration among the member states selected by the applicant. In essence, the applicant chooses a ‘lead’ member state that will carry out the scientific assessment of the MAA and review the product information. The other member states must recognize the outcome of such assessment and review except in case of a “serious potential risk to public health.” The decentralized procedure results in the grant of a national marketing authorization in each selected country. That procedure is available for all medicinal products unless they fall into the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. In practice, it is used for over-the-counter, not highly innovative products, generic products and, increasingly, for biosimilars.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”) and products with a new active substance and indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure is optional.

36



Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), the main scientific committee established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the scientific assessment of the future medicinal product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops. The European Commission grants or refuses the marketing authorization, following a procedure that involves representatives of the member states. The European Commission’s decision is in accordance with the CHMP scientific assessment except in very rare cases.
Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1394/2007, specific rules apply to ATMPs, a category that is comprised of gene therapy medical products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue-engineered medicinal products. Those rules have triggered the adoption of guidelines on manufacturing, clinical trials and pharmacovigilance that adapt the general regulatory requirements to the specific characteristics of ATMPs. Regulation (EC) 1394/2007 introduced a “hospital exemption.” which authorizes hospitals to develop ATMP for their internal use without having obtained a marketing authorization and to complying with European Union pharmaceutical law. The hospital exemption, which is in essence a compounded ATMP, has been transposed in all Member States, sometimes in such a way that the ATMPs under the hospital exemption are competitive alternatives to ATMPs with marketing authorization. The broad use of the hospital exemption by national hospitals led the European Commission to discuss with the Member States a more reasonable application of the hospital exemption that would not undermine the common legal regime for ATMP.
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Orphan Designation
Countries other than the United States have adopted a specific legal regime to support the development and marketing of drugs and biologics for rare diseases.
For example, in the European Union, Regulation 141/2000 organizes the grant of orphan drug designations to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Economic Area (the European Union, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized or, if a method exists, the product would be of significant benefit to those affected. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) examines if the orphan criteria are met and gives opinions thereon, and the orphan status is granted by the European Commission. The meeting of the criteria for orphan designation is examined again by the COMP at the time of approval of the medicinal product, which typically occurs several years after the grant of the orphan designation. If the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met at that time, the European Commission withdraws the orphan status.
In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles the sponsor to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and to ten years of market exclusivity granted following medicinal product approval. Market exclusivity precludes the EMA or a national regulatory authority from validating another MAA, and the European Commission or a national regulatory authority from granting another marketing authorization, for the same or similar medicinal product and the same therapeutic indication, for that time period. This 10-year period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The orphan exclusivity may be lost vis-à-vis another medicinal product in 

37



cases the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the medicinal product to meet patient needs or if that other product is proved to be clinically superior to the approved orphan product. A drug is clinically superior if it is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a MAA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, and it does not afford any regulatory exclusivity until a marketing authorization is granted.
Expedited Development and Approval
Mechanisms are in place in many jurisdictions that allow an earlier approval of the drug so that it reaches patients with unmet medical needs earlier. The European Union, for example, has instituted several expedited approval mechanisms including two mechanisms that are specific to the centralized procedure:

● | the accelerated approval: the EMA may reduce the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA from 210 days to 150 days when the future medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the conditional marketing authorization: as part of its marketing authorization process, the European Commission may grant marketing authorizations on the basis of less complete data than is normally required.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A conditional marketing authorization may be granted when the CHMP finds that, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, all the following requirements are met:

● | the risk/benefit balance of the medicinal product is positive;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unmet medical needs will be addressed; and
--+-------------------------------------------


● | the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data is still required.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The granting of a conditional marketing authorization is typically restricted to situations in which only the clinical part of the application is not yet fully complete. Incomplete preclinical or quality data may however be accepted if duly justified and only in the case of a product intended to be used in emergency situations in response to public health threats.
Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis. The conditions to which approval is subject will typically require the holder to complete ongoing trials or to conduct new trials with a view to confirming that the risk/benefit balance is positive and to collect pharmacovigilance data. Once the conditions to which the marketing authorization is subject are fulfilled, the conditional marketing authorization is transformed into a regular marketing authorization. If, however, the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the conditional marketing authorization ceases to be renewed.
The EMA has also implemented the so-called “PRIME” (PRIority MEdicines) status in order support the development and accelerate the approval of complex innovative medicinal products addressing an unmet medical need. PRIME status enables early dialogue with the relevant EMA scientific committees and, possibly, some payors and thus reinforces the EMA’s scientific and regulatory support. It also opens accelerated assessment of the MAA as PRIME status, is normally reserved for medicinal products that may benefit from accelerated assessment, i.e., medicines of major interest from a public health perspective, in particular from a therapeutic innovation perspective.
Finally, all medicinal products (i.e., decentralized and centralized procedures) may benefit from an MAA “under exceptional circumstances.” This marketing authorization is close to the conditional marketing authorization as it is 

38



reserved to medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a marketing authorization. However, unlike the conditional marketing authorization, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. The risk/benefit of the medicinal product is reviewed annually. As a result, although the MAA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk/benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the marketing authorization is withdrawn in case the risk/benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
Pediatrics
Mandatory testing in the pediatric population is required in more and more jurisdictions. The European Union has enacted a complex and very stringent system that has inspired other jurisdictions, including the United States and Switzerland. Any application for approval of (i) a medicinal product containing a new active substance or (ii) a new therapeutic indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of an already authorized medicinal product that contains an active substance still protected by a supplementary protection certificate (“SPC”) or a patent that qualifies for an SPC, must include pediatric data. Otherwise, the application is not validated by the competent regulatory authority. The submission of pediatric data is mandatory in those cases, even if the application concerns adult use. Submission of pediatric data is not required or fully required if the EMA granted, respectively, a full or partial waiver to pediatric development. Moreover, that submission can be postponed if the EMA grants a deferral in order not to delay the submission of the MAA for the adult population.
The pediatric data are generated through the implementation of a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) that is proposed by the company after completion of the PK studies in adults and agreed upon by the EMA, typically after some modifications. The PIP lists all the studies to conduct and measures to take in order to prove the safety and efficacy of the future medicinal product when used in children. The EMA may agree to modify the PIP at the company’s request. The scope of the PIP is the adult therapeutic indication or the condition of which the adult application is part or even the mechanism of action of the active substance, at the EMA’s quasi-discretion. This very broad discretion enables the EMA to require companies to develop children indications that are different from the adult indications.
Completion of a PIP renders the company eligible for a pediatric reward, which can be six-month extension of the term of the SPC or, in the cases of orphan medicinal products, two additional years of market exclusivity. The reward is subject, among other conditions, to the PIP being fully completed, to the pediatric medicinal product being approved in all the member states, and to the results of the pediatric studies being mentioned, in one way or another (for example, the approval of a pediatric indication), in the summary of product characteristics of the product.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Many countries impose post-marketing requirements similar to those imposed in the United States, in particular safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance. In the European Union, pharmacovigilance data are the basis for the competent regulatory authorities imposing the conduct of post-approval safety or efficacy study, including on off-label use. Non-compliance with those requirements can result in significant financial penalties as well as the suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorization.
Supplementary Protection Certificate and Regulatory Exclusivities
In some countries other than the United States, some of our patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension, depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the regulatory approval of our product candidates and any future product candidates. Furthermore, authorized drugs and biologics may benefit from regulatory exclusivities (in additional to patent protection resulting from patents).
In the European Union, Regulation (EC) 469/2009 institutes a SPC. An SPC is an extension of the term of a patent that compensates for the patent protection lost because of the legal requirements to conduct safety and efficacy tests and to obtain a marketing authorization before placing a medicinal product on the market. An SPC may be applied for any active substance that is protected by a “basic patent” (a patent chosen by the patent holder, which can be a product, process or application patent) and has not been placed on the market as a medicinal product before having obtained a 

39



marketing authorization in accordance with European Union pharmaceutical law. The term of the SPC is maximum five years, and the combined patent and SPC protection may not exceed fifteen years from the date of the first marketing authorization in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). SPC rights are restricted by both the basic patent and the marketing authorization, i.e., the SPC grants the same rights as those conferred by the basic patent but limited to the active substance covered by the marketing authorization (and any use as medicinal product approved afterwards).
While SPC are regulated at the European level, they are granted by the national patent offices. The grant of an SPC requires a basic patent granted by the national patent office and a marketing authorization, which is the first marketing authorization for the active substance as a medicinal product in the country. Furthermore, no SPC must have already been granted to the active substance, and the application for the SPC must be filed with the national patent office within six months of the first marketing authorization in the EEA or the grant of the basic patent, whichever is the latest.
In the future, we may apply for an SPC for one or more of our currently owned or licensed European patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant MAA.
Furthermore, in the European Union, medicinal products may benefit from the following regulatory exclusivities: data exclusivity, market protection, market exclusivity, and pediatric reward.
A medicinal product that contains a new active substance (reference medicinal product) is granted eight years of data exclusivity followed by two years of market protection. Data exclusivity prevents other companies from referring to the non-clinical and clinical data in marketing authorization dossier of the reference medicinal product for submission of generic MAA purposes, and market protection prevents other companies from placing generics on the market. Pursuant to the concept of global marketing authorization, any further development of that medicinal product (e.g., new indication, new form, change to the active substance) by the marketing authorization holder does not trigger any new or additional protection. The authorization of any new development is considered as “falling” into the initial marketing authorization with regard to regulatory protection; hence, the new development only benefits from the regulatory protection that remains when it is authorized. The only exception is a new therapeutic indication that is considered as bringing a significant clinical benefit in comparison to the existing therapies. Such new indication will add one-year of market protection to the global marketing authorization, provided that it is authorized within the first eight years of authorization (i.e., during the data exclusivity period). Moreover, a new therapeutic indication of a “well-established substance” benefits from one-year data exclusivity but limited to the non-clinical and clinical data supporting the new indication. Any active substance approved for at least ten years in the EEA qualifies as well-established substance.
Biosimilars may be approved through an abbreviated approval pathway after the expiration of the eight-year data exclusivity period and may be marketed after the 10- or 11-year market protection period. The approval of biosimilars requires the applicant to demonstrate similarity between the biosimilar and the biological medicinal product and to submit the non-clinical and clinical data defined by the EMA. The biosimilar legal regime has been mainly developed through EMA’s scientific guidelines applicable to categories of biological active substances. Unlike in the United States, interchangeability is regulated by each member state.
Market exclusivity is a regulatory protection exclusively afforded to medicinal products with an orphan status. Market exclusivity precludes the EMA or a national regulatory authority from validating another MAA, and the European Commission or a national regulatory authority from granting another marketing authorization, for a same or similar medicinal product and a same therapeutic indication, for a period of ten years from approval (see above).
Pediatric reward is another regulatory exclusivity. Completion of a PIP renders the company eligible for a pediatric reward, which can be six-month extension of the term of the SPC or, in the cases of orphan medicinal products, two additional years of market exclusivity (see above). In case a PIP is completed on a voluntary basis, i.e., for an approved medicinal product that is not or no longer protected by an SPC or a basic patent, the pediatric reward takes the form of a “pediatric use marketing authorization” (“PUMA”). That special authorization does not fall into the global marketing authorization and thus benefits from eight years of data exclusivity followed by two or three years of market protection.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements Outside of the United States
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is mainly governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the member states, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010, or national anti-kickback provisions (France, Belgium, etc.). Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. In certain member states, payments made to physicians must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Much like the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, that prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity, similar rules apply to many other countries worldwide such as France (“Loi Sapin”) or the United Kingdom (UK Bribery Act). It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Although none of our product candidates has been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of third-party reimbursement from payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed-care plans. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.

facilities and general management. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, we have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to our continued efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment. We recruit the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other protected traits and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws (domestic and foreign) applicable to discrimination in the workplace. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies that are guided by our executive leadership team.

Health, Safety and Well-Being 
Protecting the health, safety and well-being of colleagues and , all of whom are essential to delivering our business objectives, is an integral part of how we operate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we instituted a remote work protocol to help ensure the safety of our employees, our community, and to adhere to federal, state, and local requirements and the CDC recommendations of social distancing and limited public exposure in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not implement any furlough, layoff, or salary reductions during this time. In 2022, we continued to carry out our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response procedures to help ensure on-site workers at all of our locations remained safe and healthy. These precautions have been instrumental in protecting our workforce and helping ensure continued development of our pipeline. We continue to evaluate our pandemic preparedness and response procedures and the advisability of continuing operations based on federal, state and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic and the best interests of our employees, third parties with whom we collaborate, and our stockholders.
Compensation and Benefits

Our commitment to pay equity for all colleagues is rooted in our core values and our intention is to continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce. We are committed to equitable pay practices for employees based on role, education, experience, performance, and location and Armata conducts pay equity reviews on an annual basis. We believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition to cash compensation, we provide equity compensation, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs. We also have a defined contribution plan in the United States, enabling eligible employees to contribute a portion of their salaries and bonuses to the plans, and beginning in 2023 we will match, in cash, a portion of the employee contributions.

Corporate History and Reorganization 
Our company was created as a result of a business combination of Armata (formerly known as AmpliPhi) with C3J that became effective on May 9, 2019. Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, AmpliPhi changed its name to Armata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
C3J’s predecessor, C3 Jian, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on November 4, 2005. On February 26, 2016, as part of a reorganization transaction, C3 Jian, Inc. merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of C3J, and as part of this process, C3 Jian, Inc. was converted to a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of California named C3 Jian, LLC. Prior to the Merger, C3J was privately held and was financed principally through a series of equity financings.
AmpliPhi was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington in March 1989 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Immunex Corporation and began operations as an independent company in 1992 as Targeted Genetics Corporation. In January 2011, AmpliPhi completed the acquisition of Biocontrol Ltd, an antimicrobial biotechnology company based in the United Kingdom, with the goal of developing their phage therapy programs using funding from the sale of our legacy gene therapy assets. In November 2012, AmpliPhi completed the acquisition of Special Phage Holdings Pty Ltd, a
