ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business — An Overview
NeuroMetrix is a commercial stage neurotechnology company based in Woburn, Massachusetts. The Company’s mission is to improve individual and population health through innovative medical devices and technology solutions for neurological disorders and pain syndromes.  Our core expertise in biomedical engineering has been refined over two decades of designing, building and marketing medical devices that stimulate nerves and analyze nerve response for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. We are fully integrated with in-house capabilities spanning research and development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, product fulfillment and customer support. We hold extensive, proprietary intellectual property. 
NeuroMetrix created the market for point-of-care nerve testing and introduced sophisticated wearable technology for chronic pain syndromes. Nearly five million patients have been served with our products.  Revenue is derived from the sale of medical devices and after-market consumable products and accessories in the United States and select overseas markets. Products are authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and regulators in foreign jurisdictions where appropriate. We have two principal product categories: 
•Diagnostic technology - point-of-care peripheral neuropathy assessment 
•Therapeutic technology – wearable neuromodulation for chronic pain syndromes
Peripheral neuropathies, also called polyneuropathies, are diseases of the peripheral nerves. They affect about 10% of adults in the United States, with the prevalence rising to over 30% among individuals 65 years and older. Peripheral 
neuropathies are associated with loss of sensation, pain, increased risk of falling, weakness, and other complications. People with peripheral neuropathies have a diminished quality of life, poor overall health and higher mortality. The most common specific cause of peripheral neuropathies, accounting for about one-third of cases, is diabetes. Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic with an estimated affected population of over 400 million people. Within the United States there are over 30 million people with diabetes and another 80 million with pre-diabetes. The annual direct cost of treating diabetes in the United States exceeds $100 billion. Although there are dangerous acute manifestations of diabetes, the primary burden of the disease is in its long-term complications which include cardiovascular disease, nerve disease and resulting conditions such as foot ulcers which may require amputation, eye disease leading to blindness, and kidney failure. The most common long-term complication of diabetes, affecting over 50% of the diabetic population, is peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the primary trigger for diabetic foot ulcers which may progress to the point of requiring amputation. People with diabetes have a 15-25% lifetime risk of foot ulcers and approximately 15% of foot ulcers lead to amputation. Foot ulcers are the most expensive complication of diabetes with a typical cost of $5,000 to $50,000 per episode. In addition, between 16% and 26% of people with diabetes suffer from chronic pain in the feet and lower legs.
Early detection of peripheral neuropathies, such as DPN, is important because there are no treatment options once the nerves have degenerated. Today’s diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathies range from a simple monofilament test for lack of sensory perception in the feet to a nerve conduction study performed by a specialist. Our DPNCheck nerve conduction technology provides a rapid, low cost, quantitative test for peripheral neuropathies, including DPN. It addresses an important medical need and is particularly effective in screening large populations. DPNCheck has been validated in multiple clinical studies.
Chronic pain is a significant public health problem. It is defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as pain lasting more than 12 weeks. This contrasts with acute pain which is a normal bodily response to injury or trauma. Chronic pain conditions include low back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, cancer pain and many others. Chronic pain may be triggered by an injury or there may be an ongoing cause such as disease or illness. There may also be no clear cause. Chronic pain can also lead to other health problems. These can include fatigue, sleep disturbance and mood changes, which cause difficulty in carrying out important activities and contributing to disability and despair. In general, chronic pain cannot be cured. Treatment of chronic pain is focused on reducing pain and improving function. The goal is effective pain management.
Chronic pain affects nearly 100 million adults in the United States and more than 1.5 billion people worldwide. The estimated incremental impact of chronic pain on health care costs in the United States is over $250 billion per year and lost productivity is estimated to exceed $300 billion per year. The most common approach to chronic pain management is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter (OTC) internal and external analgesics as well as prescription pain medications, both non-opioid and opioids. The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often inadequate. Side effects, including the potential for addiction are substantial. Reflecting the complexity of chronic pain and the difficulty in treating it, we believe that inadequate relief leads 25% to 50% of pain sufferers to seek alternatives to prescription pain medications. These alternatives include nutraceuticals, acupuncture, chiropractic care, non-prescription analgesics, electrical stimulators, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In total these pain relief products and services account for approximately $20 billion in annual out-of-pocket spending in the United States.
Nerve stimulation is a long-established category of treatment for chronic pain. This treatment approach is available through implantable devices which have both surgical and ongoing risks, such as migration of the implanted nerve stimulation leads. Non-invasive approaches involving transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have achieved limited efficacy in practice due to power limitations, inadequate dosing and low patient adherence. We believe that our Quell wearable technology for chronic pain is designed to address many of the limitations of traditional TENS. 
Business Strategy
Our leading commercial products, and the focus of our strategic attention, are DPNCheck and Quell. 
DPNCheck is our well-established testing technology for peripheral neuropathies. This technology has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies. It contributes attractive gross margins and has posted an average growth rate of 16.5% over the past five years. During 2022 we invested in the expansion of our DPNCheck commercial staff. This included adding personnel resources in sales, marketing and training with the goal of accelerating revenue in the Medicare Advantage market sector. We now have a commercial team with deep experience in the Medicare Advantage sector which is growing rapidly and is expected to exceed traditional Medicare fee-for-service within the next two years. This sector is dominated by large healthcare providers where the typical sales cycle is quite long. Accordingly, we expect to see the early revenue impacts from our expanded commercial team in the second half of 2023. 
During 2023 we will encourage the existing DPNCheck installed base to transition to our next generation technology, DPNCheck 2.0 which was released in late 2022. This new device enhances the user experience and improves testing efficiency while continuing to deliver quantitative test results and high overall sensitivity and specificity. It also replaces electric and other parts in the predecessor device which may have become obsolete. Our DPNCheck product development efforts in 2023 will focus on the software ecosystem connecting user testing at the clinic level to the overall business enterprise via a DPNCheck data cloud, and also facilitating linkages between clinic testing and patient electronic medical records (EMR). This integration project is complex and costly; however, it is essential to expanding usage of DPNCheck, particularly in large organizations. 
Quell is our wearable neuromodulation technology for chronic pain. It has been refined over the past seven years with over 200,000 chronic pain patients and is protected by over 20 U.S. utility patents. Patients control and personalize the technology via a mobile phone app, and their utilization and certain clinical metrics may be tracked in the Quell Health Cloud. The degree of technological sophistication, combined with our extensive consumer experience and the compelling results of clinical studies gives us the opportunity to leverage this technology base into a portfolio of Quell-based prescription (Rx) wearable neurotherapeutics. 
In 2021 Quell received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for a fibromyalgia indication. A pivotal double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical study of Quell - Fibromyalgia has since been completed, and a De Novo marketing authorization was obtained from the FDA in 2022. Quell – Fibromyalgia is indicated for use as an aid for reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults with high pain sensitivity. This prescription product was introduced at the American College of Rheumatology 2022 Annual Meeting followed by a strategic commercial launch initiated in December 2022 to broaden market awareness and our understanding of market dynamics. 
Quell also received FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in early 2022 for the treatment of chronic Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). A CIPN double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical study employing Quell and funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) recently completed enrollment. Study results are expected to be published during in the first half of 2023. Positive results from that study would position us for a DeNovo filing with FDA similar to our approach with Quell – Fibromyalgia and, if successful, to an early 2024 launch of our second product in the portfolio of Quell-based prescription wearable therapeutics. We plan a similar approach with other disease indications involving chronic pain. These potentially include Chronic Low Back Pain, Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID 19, Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPC), Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) and others. 
ADVANCE is our legacy, point-of-care neurodiagnostic technology primarily used for the diagnosis and screening for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The technology has been marketed since 2008. Sales of ADVANCE devices were discontinued several years ago and we continue to provide disposable electrodes to a customer base of hand surgeons and manufacturers for industrial health use. 
Research and Development for Competitive Advantage
Our products are proprietary and were developed in-house by our research and development team. We believe that continual product innovation, focusing on our unique competency of precision neurostimulation, is essential to profitable growth and competitive advantage. Our 2023 research and development efforts are focused in two areas important to our future: 1) expanding our enterprise integration and population health analytics tools for DPNCheck users; and 2) further developing the Quell technology platform of disease-specific wearable neuromodulation products for chronic pain symptoms.
Business Model
Our product technologies consist of a medical device used in conjunction with a consumable electrode or biosensor. Other accessories and consumables are also available to customers. Our goal is the development of active, installed user bases regularly ordering or subscribing to aftermarket products. Our DPNCheck, Quell and ADVANCE products all conform to this business model. 
Primary Marketed Products
DPNCheck
DPNCheck is a fast, accurate, and quantitative nerve conduction test that is used to evaluate peripheral neuropathies (also called polyneuropathies or systemic neuropathies) such as DPN. It is designed to be used by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, podiatrists and other clinicians at the point-of-care to objectively detect, stage, and monitor peripheral neuropathies. The device measures nerve conduction velocity and response amplitude of the sural nerve, a nerve in the lower leg and ankle. These parameters are recognized as sensitive and specific biomarkers of peripheral neuropathies. DPNCheck is comprised of: (1) an electronic hand-held device and (2) a single patient-use biosensor (limited biosensor re-use is allowed in certain international markets). In addition, we provide users with PC-based software that links to the device via a USB connection thereby allowing physicians to generate reports, manage their test data and integrate with enterprise systems including EMR. 
DPNCheck is a modified version of our previously marketed NC-stat nerve testing device that has the same clinical indications with respect to peripheral neuropathies. While lower in cost than the original device, DPNCheck has the same functionality with respect to sural nerve testing. Approximately 4.3 million patient studies have been performed using our NC-stat technology. Our nerve testing technology has been the subject of over 50 peer-reviewed publications, including over 30 studies specifically addressing the accuracy and clinical utility of the DPNCheck device in the assessment of DPN and other peripheral neuropathies. Cumulatively through 2022, approximately 8,400 DPNCheck devices have been shipped to customers.
Quell
Quell is a wearable device for symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain indications. It incorporates a collection of proprietary approaches designed to optimize the effectiveness of nerve stimulation. These include high power electrical stimulation hardware with precise control, algorithms that automatically determine therapeutic stimulation intensity and compensate for nerve desensitization, and automated detection of user sleep and appropriate adjustment of stimulation level. Quell is comprised of (1) an electronic device that is placed in a flexible band worn on the upper calf, (2) an electrode that attaches to the device and is the interface between the device and the skin, and (3) a smartphone app to control the device and visualize, understand and optimize data relating to chronic pain and health. The app is integrated with the Quell Health Cloud for storage of user data, data analytics and scientific research. An Apple Watch® app provides many of the functions of the smartphone app with the convenience of a smartwatch. The Quell device is lightweight and can be worn during the day while active, and at night while sleeping. It has been authorized by the FDA for symptomatic relief and management of lower extremity chronic pain and as an aid for reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults with high pain sensitivity. Cumulatively through 2022, approximately 204,000 Quell devices have been shipped to customers.
ADVANCE
The ADVANCE System is our legacy neurodiagnostics business. It is a comprehensive platform for the performance of nerve conduction studies. The ADVANCE System is comprised of (1) the ADVANCE device and related modules, (2) various types of electrodes, and (3) a communication hub that enables a physician’s office to network the device to their office computers and to our servers for data archiving and report generation. The ADVANCE System is used with proprietary nerve specific electrode arrays. These electrode arrays combine multiple individual electrodes and embedded microelectronic components into a single patient-use disposable unit. We currently market a number of different nerve-specific electrode arrays but have discontinued sale of ADVANCE devices.
Historically, the ADVANCE System was marketed to a broad range of physician specialties including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, primary care physicians, and endocrinologists, and utilized for a variety of different clinical indications including assessment of CTS, low back and leg pain, and DPN. It is most commonly used in the assessment of CTS. Over 20 
peer-reviewed studies have been published on the use of this technology in this clinical application. As of December 31, 2022, we had an installed base of approximately 90 active customers for the ADVANCE System.
The following chart summarizes our previously and currently marketed products.

NC-stat | Q2 1999 – Q3 2010 | Nerve Conduction | Evaluation of entrapment and systemic neuropathies | 

Customers
DPNCheck customers include managed care organizations, endocrinologists, podiatrists and primary care physicians in the United States and distributors in Europe, Japan, China and the Middle East. Through December 31, 2022, over 8,400 DPNCheck devices have been shipped to customers. Quell customers are primarily consumers in the United States. Cumulatively through December 31, 2022, approximately 204,000 Quell devices have been shipped. Our legacy ADVANCE System customers include approximately 90 active accounts covering occupational health, primary care, internal medicine, orthopedic and hand surgeons, pain medicine physicians, neurologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, and neurosurgeons.
At December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 31% of accounts receivable and one customer accounted for 32% of revenue.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
Our U.S. sales efforts for DPNCheck primarily focus on Medicare Advantage organizations and providers who assume financial responsibility and the associated risks for the health care costs of their patients. We believe that DPNCheck presents an attractive clinical case with detection of peripheral neuropathy allowing for earlier clinical intervention to help mitigate the effects of peripheral neuropathy on both patient quality of life and cost of care. Also, the diagnosis and documentation of peripheral neuropathy provided by DPNCheck helps clarify the patient health profile which, in turn, may have a direct, positive effect on Medicare Advantage reimbursement through the Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) system. Outside the United States, DPNCheck is sold in Japan by our distribution partner Fukuda Denshi Co., Ltd. and in China by Omron Medical (Beijing) Ltd. Sales and marketing efforts for DPNCheck are led by our Senior Vice President, Population Health and Value Based Care.
Quell – Fibromyalgia is available in the United States via HealthWarehouse.com, an on-line pharmacy. A prescription is required for purchase. The Company is conducting a strategic launch of this product to optimize its marketing strategy.  Quell (OTC) for lower extremity chronic pain is no longer available to new customers.  Sales and marketing efforts for Quell are led by our National Sales Director, Neuromodulation. 
Customer Service handles domestic ADVANCE sales and support. A small network of independent distributors in several European countries and Canada support ADVANCE in their jurisdictions. 
Manufacturing and Supply
We perform final assembly and servicing of our Quell and DPNCheck devices at our manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. The ADVANCE device which is no longer in production but for which we continue to sell accessories, is serviced by us. Outside suppliers provide the sub-assemblies and components that we use in manufacturing Quell and DPNCheck, as well as our consumable products including biosensors and electrodes. Reflecting the relatively small volumes of our products being manufactured and sold, we do not have alternative suppliers for many of the key components of our products. Rather we rely on regular contact and close working relationships with local suppliers developed over many years. In outsourcing, we target companies that meet FDA, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and other quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Supplier performance is maintained and managed through a corrective action program ensuring all product requirements are met or exceeded. Following the receipt of products or product components from our third-party manufacturers, we conduct the necessary inspection, final assembly, packaging, and labeling at our manufacturing facility. We believe that our manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment, provide us with manufacturing expertise, and helps control costs.
A New England regional supplier has been manufacturing devices and providing sub-assemblies to us since 2005. The supplier currently manufactures sub-assemblies for Quell and DPNCheck. A supplier based in the central United States has been manufacturing ADVANCE electrodes for us since 1999. A full-service original equipment manufacturer (OEM) also based in the central United States and specializing in medical and cosmetic devices, manufactures DPNCheck biosensors and Quell electrodes.
We are registered with the FDA and subject to compliance with FDA quality system regulations. As a registered device manufacturer, we undergo regularly scheduled FDA quality system inspections, are subject to periodic inspections by state agencies and, if deemed necessary by the FDA, additional inspections may occur. We are also ISO registered and undergo annual quality system audits by a European agency. ADVANCE and DPNCheck are cleared for marketing within the United States, Canada and the European Union. DPNCheck is also cleared for marketing in Japan, China and Mexico. Quell is authorized for marketing in the United States. 
Research and Development
We believe that we have research and development (R&D) capability that is unique to the industry with over two decades of experience in developing diagnostic and therapeutic devices involving the precision stimulation and measurement of nerve signals for clinical purposes. Our company has extensive experience in neurophysiology, biomedical instrumentation, signal processing, biomedical sensors, and information systems.
Our R&D team works closely with marketing and customers to design products that are focused on improving clinical outcomes. The team of eight engineers includes one who holds an M.D. degree. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer leads R&D and coordinates our clinical program. He holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. 
R&D efforts planned for 2023: 
•DPNCheck . During 2022 we completed the upgrade and market release of our DPNCheck 2.0 device which delivers an improved user experience and also addresses manufacturing issues and replaces electronic and other parts that may have become obsolete. In 2023 our DPNCheck focus will shift to development of the software ecosystem beyond the patient test itself to covering the broader healthcare enterprise. The primary features of this program will be development of a DPNCheck data cloud where test information would be aggregated for an enterprise-wide view of testing, and also to enable the transmission of patient data to EMR. 
•Quell Prescription Wearable Therapeutic Initiative. In 2022 we secured regulatory approval for Quell-Fibromyalgia and addressed technology enhancements essential for commercial launch which was initiated at the end of the year. The next therapeutic target for the technology will be Quell - Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN), which was the subject of a pivotal clinical study supported by the NIH and NCI. This study was a multi-center, double 
blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial of Quell in CIPN. A total of 150 patients were enrolled, with subjects randomized to an active or sham Quell device for 6-weeks. The primary outcome measure is the baseline to 6-week change in the EORTC-CIPN20 (a composite measure of CIPN symptoms and functional impairments). Other outcomes include individual CIPN symptoms and objective measures of central descending pain inhibition, lower limb sensation threshold, and balance. Enrollment in the study was completed late in 2022 and study results are expected in the first half of 2023. 
•Clinical studies for our wearable technology. We plan to continue efforts to build the body of evidence from external clinical studies that is foundational to our Quell initiative. 
Clinical Program
Our clinical program operates under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer. This may from time-to-time be comprised of internal, collaborative, and external clinical studies. Internal clinical studies are designed and implemented directly by us for the purposes of product design and early clinical validation. Collaborative studies are conducted together with leading researchers around the world to provide clinical validation and to explore the clinical utility of our products. External studies are entirely independent of us, although in many cases the researchers request unrestricted grants for financial and/or material support, such as for devices and consumables. External studies may examine the clinical performance and utility of our products or our products may be used as outcomes measures. We actively seek to publish clinical study results in leading peer-reviewed journals while also encouraging our clinical collaborators and clinical study grant recipients to do the same. During 2023 we expect that our clinical program will be limited to external studies.
Competition
The Quell technology falls within the crowded TENS category which encompasses a wide number of neurostimulation devices, the majority of which are imported from Asia-based manufacturers. However, we believe there is no direct competition to our Quell technology with the level of power, sophistication, and user features for the symptomatic relief of chronic pain. The most common approach to chronic pain is pain medication. This includes over-the-counter drugs (such as Advil and Motrin), and prescription drugs including anti-convulsants (such as Lyrica and Neurontin) and anti-depressants (such as Cymbalta and Elavil). Topical creams may also be used (such as Zostrix and Bengay). With severe pain, narcotic or opioid pain medications may be prescribed (such as codeine, fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone). The approach to treatment is individualized, drug combinations may be employed, and the results are often inadequate. Side effects, including the potential for addiction, are substantial.
Reflecting the difficulty in treating chronic pain, inadequate relief leads many pain sufferers to turn to the over-the-counter market for supplements or alternatives to prescription pain medications. These include non-prescription medications, topical creams, lotions, TENS devices, dietary products, braces, sleeves, pads and other items. In the United States, over $4 billion is spent annually on such pain relief products.
Nerve stimulation is an established treatment for chronic pain. It is available through implantable spinal cord stimulation; however, this approach requires surgery and has attendant risks. Non-invasive approaches to neurostimulation have achieved limited success in practice due to device limitations, inadequate dosing and low patient adherence. We believe that our Quell – Fibromyalgia wearable technology whose prescription indications make it the only FDA authorized non-pharmaceutical treatment for fibromyalgia, and its personalization features including app control, high power and automation, and digital health integration characteristics place it in a unique neurostimulation category without direct competition. Further, we expect that our initiative to build a portfolio of Quell-based prescription wearable neurotherapeutics will, if successful, significantly reduce or eliminate direct competition from TENS devices. 
We believe that DPNCheck is currently the only objective and standardized test for peripheral neuropathies widely available at the point-of-care. The American Diabetes Association and other organizations recommend at least annual evaluation of all people with diabetes for DPN. Due to cost and availability, the evaluation is typically performed using a simple (5.07/10g) monofilament. The method is subjective and only identifies late stage neuropathy where intervention is generally limited to foot care. Experts in the field have indicated that there is an unmet need for a practical, objective, and 
sensitive test for diabetic neuropathy that can be widely deployed in the regular care of all people with diabetes. Monofilaments (5.07/10g) are a commodity sold by multiple medical supply companies.
There are several companies that sell neurodiagnostic devices that may compete with our ADVANCE System. These companies include Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. and Natus Medical Incorporated, both of which have substantially greater financial resources than NeuroMetrix. Natus Medical Incorporated and Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. have effective worldwide distribution channels for supplying medical instruments to neurologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights, and know-how. We hold issued utility patents covering a number of important aspects of our Quell, SENSUS, DPNCheck and ADVANCE products. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We also require our employees, consultants and advisors, whom we expect to work on our products, to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived, or developed using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 
Patents
As of December 31, 2022, we had 50 issued U.S. patents, 50 issued foreign patents, and 33 patent applications. Our wearable therapeutic products have 24 issued U.S. utility patents, 19 foreign utility patents, 10 issued U.S. design patents plus 24 issued foreign design patents. We also have 32 patent applications related to our wearable therapeutic products (12 U.S. and 20 foreign). For our DPNCheck diagnostic device, 11 utility patents (4 U.S. and 7 foreign) were issued that cover the core technology.
With regard to our legacy neurodiagnostic products, our issued design patents began to expire in 2015, and our issued utility patents began to expire in 2017. We have additional patents and patent applications directed to other novel inventions that extend patent terms into 2023 to 2031.
The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. If our products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture, and sale of these potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. Because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights.
A patent infringement suit brought against us may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party’s intellectual property, unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain rights to the third-party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.
Trademarks
We hold domestic registrations for the trademarks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, stylized Q, Quell Health Cloud, DPNCheck, SENSUS, NC-stat, ADVANCE, and NC-stat DPNCheck. We use a trademark for Wearable Pain Relief Technology and Therapy Autopilot. We hold certain foreign registrations for the marks NEUROMETRIX, Quell, OptiTherapy, and NC-stat. 
Third-Party Reimbursement
Procedures performed with our neurodiagnostic medical devices including ADVANCE and DPNCheck may be paid for by third-party payers, including government health programs, such as Medicare, and private insurance and managed care organizations. The 2023 Physicians Fee Schedule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) includes CPT 95905 for nerve conduction studies performed with pre-configured electrode arrays such as those used with the DPNCheck device and the ADVANCE System. 
We believe that physicians are generally receiving reimbursement under CPT 95905 from Medicare for nerve conduction studies performed for carpal tunnel syndrome using pre-configured electrode arrays that meet the medical necessity requirements in their local Medicare region but that commercial insurers are generally not providing reimbursement. Reimbursement by third-party payers is an important element of success for medical device companies. We do not foresee a significant near-term improvement in reimbursement for procedures performed with ADVANCE and DPNCheck.
In the United States, some insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs which monitor and, for payment purposes, often require pre-approval of the services that a member’s provider prescribes. Some managed care programs pay their providers a predetermined annual payment per member which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their members. Our United States sales efforts for DPNCheck are focused on the Medicare Advantage program. The Medicare Advantage program is administered by CMS and operated by private managed care organizations or insurers referred to as Medicare Advantage organizations (“MAOs”). CMS pays these MAOs capitated fees that are adjusted under CMS’s risk adjustment model, which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to ensure the adequacy of payment. Members with higher risk codes generally require more healthcare resources than those with lower risk codes. In turn, the MAOs fully absorbs the risk of patient health care costs. MAOs may share a portion of the risk with provider organizations such as independent practice associations (IPAs) with whom they contract to provide medical services to their members. Proper assessment of each member’s health status and accurate coding helps to assure that MAOs receive capitation fees consistent with the cost of insuring these members. Nerve conduction testing can provide valuable, early identification of peripheral neuropathy leading to clinical interventions that can reduce health care costs. Also, these tests provide valuable input regarding each member’s health risk status which can result in more appropriate capitated payments from CMS. 
The Medicare Advantage program is currently experiencing uncertainty due to changes in several aspects of the Medicare Advantage program recently proposed by the CMS. On January 30, 2023, CMS issued a final rule regarding the MA Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) program that is used to recover improper risk adjustment payments made to MAOs. Also, on February 1, 2023, CMS issued its 2024 Medicare Advantage Advance Notice, which proposed substantial changes to the Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) risk adjustment model for calendar year 2024. The proposal includes changes that limit HCC codes for some types of peripheral neuropathies. The eventual impact of these factors and related uncertainty is unclear; however, there could be a material effect on future DPNCheck revenues and margins. 
We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services.
Our success in selling DPNCheck and ADVANCE will depend upon, among other things, our customers receiving, and our potential customers’ expectation that they will receive sufficient reimbursement or patient capitated premium adjustments from third-party payers for procedures or therapies using these products. We expect that Quell will generally not be reimbursed by third party payers in the near future. See “Risk Factors,” “If health care providers are unable to obtain sufficient reimbursement or other financial incentives from third-party health care payers related to the use of our products other than Quell, their adoption and our future product sales will be materially adversely affected.”
FDA and Other Governmental Regulation
FDA Regulation
Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by other regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the risks associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Those three classes are:
•Class I, the lowest risk products, which require compliance with medical device general controls, including labeling, establishment registration, device product listing, adverse event reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA’s quality system regulations;
•Class II, comprising moderate-risk devices, which also require compliance with general controls and in some cases, so-called special controls that may include performance standards, particular labeling requirements, or post-market surveillance obligations; typically a Class II device also requires pre-market review and clearance by FDA of a pre-market notification (also referred to as a “510(k) application”) as well as adherence to the quality system regulations/good manufacturing practices for devices; and
•Class III, high-risk devices that are often implantable or life-sustaining, which also require compliance with the medical device general controls and quality system regulations, but which generally must be approved by FDA before entering the market, through a more-lengthy pre-market approval (PMA) application. Approved PMAs can include post-approval conditions and post-market surveillance requirements, analogous to some of the special controls that may be imposed on Class II devices.
Before being introduced into the U.S. market, our products must obtain marketing clearance or approval from FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process, the de novo classification process (summarized below under De Novo Classification Process (the PMA process), unless they are determined to be Class I devices or to otherwise qualify for an exemption from one of these available forms of pre-market review and authorization by the FDA. To date, our products have all been classified as Class II, moderate-risk medical devices and have been subject to the 510(k) review and clearance process. See “Risk Factors,” “We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA which could restrict the sales and marketing of Quell, DPNCheck and ADVANCE, as well as other products for which we may seek FDA clearance or approval, and could cause us to incur significant costs.”
510(k) Pre-Market Notification Process
Class II devices typically require pre-market review and clearance by the FDA, which is accomplished through the submission of a 510(k) pre-market notification before the device may be marketed. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, or to a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I - this device to which the new device is compared is called the “predicate device.” In some cases, we may be required to perform clinical trials to support a claim of substantial equivalence. If clinical trials are required, we may be required to submit an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be cleared by the FDA prior to the start of a clinical investigation, unless the device and clinical investigation are considered non-significant risk by the FDA or are exempt from the IDE requirements. Whether or not an IDE is required for a clinical study involving a medical device, an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) must review and approve the study protocol before it is initiated. It generally takes three months from the date of the pre-market notification submission to obtain a final 510(k) clearance decision from the FDA, but it can be significantly longer.
After a medical device receives a 510(k) clearance letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the new device for one or more specific indications for use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires the submission of a new 510(k) notification or could require de novo classification or a PMA. The FDA allows each company to make this determination, but the FDA can review the decision as part of routine compliance audits of the company. If the FDA disagrees with a company’s decision not to seek prior FDA authorization, the FDA may require the company to seek additional 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA also can require the company to cease marketing and/or recall the medical device in question until its regulatory status is resolved.
De Novo Classification Process
If the FDA determines that a new, previously unclassified medical device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk (in other words, they do not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a PMA because any risks associated with the device could be mitigated through general controls and/or special controls) may be eligible for the 510(k) De Novo classification process. If a product is classified as Class II through the De Novo classification process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications.
FDA has issued a Guidance document that formally codifies requirements for the medical device De Novo process and the procedures and criteria for product developers to file a De Novo classification request. FDA’s activities to create predictability, 
consistency, and transparency for innovative medical device developers may benefit the medical technology industry as a whole.
PMA Application Process
If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process and is not eligible for classification as a low or moderate-risk device through the De Novo process, the device is deemed to be Class III and a company must submit a PMA application to seek authorization for its commercial sale. A PMA requires more extensive pre-filing testing than is required in the 510(k) application and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain. The PMA review and approval process can take one to three years or longer, from the time the PMA application is filed with the FDA. Under a PMA, the company must demonstrate to the FDA that the new medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. A PMA typically includes extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device, its design, manufacture, labeling and components. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulation (QSR).
If FDA approves the PMA, the approved indications may be more limited than those originally sought. In addition, FDA’s approval order may include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with the post-approval conditions can result in adverse enforcement or administrative actions, including the withdrawal of the approval. Approval of a new PMA application or a PMA supplement may be required before making certain types of modifications to the device, including to its labeling, intended use or indication, or manufacturing process, especially when such modifications have the potential to affect safety and effectiveness.
Post-Marketing Compliance Obligations
Regardless of which pre-market pathway a medical device uses to reach the U.S. market, after a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices);
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide adequate information on both risks and benefits;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA any event that the company learns of in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and device recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDA caused by the device that may present a risk to health;
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility;
•regular and for-cause inspections by FDA to review a manufacturer’s facility and its compliance with applicable FDA requirements; and
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations.
Regulatory Approvals and Clearances
The ADVANCE System received 510(k) clearance as a Class II medical device in April 2008 for its intended use by physicians to perform nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography procedures.
The NC-stat System is also a Class II medical device and has been the subject of several 510(k) clearances, most recently in July 2006 (K060584). The NC-stat System is cleared for use to stimulate and measure neuromuscular signals that are useful in diagnosing and evaluating systemic and entrapment neuropathies. Our NC-stat DPNCheck, or DPNCheck, device is a technical modification to the 510(k) cleared NC-stat device and has the same intended use, and therefore does not raise safety or effectiveness questions that would require a separate 510(k) submission under the FDA’s published guidance on 510(k) requirements for modified devices.
As transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators, the SENSUS and Quell pain therapy devices are Class II medical devices that received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August 2012 and July 2014, respectively. In November 2012, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the disposable electrode used in conjunction with the SENSUS device, and in July 2013, the FDA provided 510(k) clearance for the use of SENSUS during sleep. The intended use of the SENSUS pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. The SENSUS device is no longer marketed and, where possible, we have transitioned SENSUS customers to Quell. In July 2014, our Quell device received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use and in November 2014, our Quell disposable electrode received 510(k) clearance for over-the-counter use. In January 2016, a number of new features were added to Quell and received 510(k) clearance, most notably use with an optional mobile app that contains several convenience features. The intended use of the Quell pain management therapeutic system is the symptomatic relief and management of chronic pain. The Quell device may also be used during nighttime sleep.
Quell – Fibromyalgia is a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator employing our core Quell technology. Its intended use was not substantially equivalent to an existing predicate device; however, it was considered low to moderate risk. FDA accepted the eligibility of Quell – Fibromyalgia as a 510 (k) De Novo submission and provided the device with De Novo authorization in May 2022. 
Federal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulatory oversight. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, or injunctions affecting the manner in which Quell could be marketed in the future.
Manufacturing Facilities
Our facility, and the facilities utilized by our contract sub-assembly manufacturer, have been inspected by FDA in the past, and observations were noted. There were no findings that involved a significant violation of regulatory requirements. The responses to these observations have been accepted by the FDA and we believe that we and our contract manufacturers are in substantial compliance with the FDA Quality System Regulation (QSR). We expect that our facility and our subcontract facilities will be inspected again as required by the FDA. If the FDA finds significant violations, we could be subject to fines, recalls, requirements to halt manufacturing, or other administrative or judicial sanctions.
Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP)
The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) recognized that a global approach to auditing and monitoring the manufacturing of medical devices could improve their safety and oversight on an international scale. The IMDRF established a work group which developed specific documents to advance a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP).
The Medical Device Single Audit Program allowed MDSAP recognized Auditing Organizations to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer to satisfy the relevant requirements of the regulatory authorities participating in the program.
MDSAP participating international partners include:
•MDSAP Members
◦Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia
◦Brazil’s Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária
◦Health Canada
◦Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
◦U.S. Food and Drug Administration
•MDSAP Official Observers:
◦The World Health Organization (WHO) Prequalification of In Vitro Diagnostics (IVDs) Programme
◦European Union (EU)
•MDSAP Affiliate Members: 
◦Republic of Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
Based on its evaluation of the MDSAP Final Pilot Report, the MDSAP Regulatory Authority Council (the international MDSAP governing body) determined that the MDSAP Pilot had satisfactorily demonstrated the viability of the Medical Device Single Audit Program.
In July 2022, NeuroMetrix underwent a MDSAP audit by the registrar TÜV SÜD. There were several observations noted during the MDSAP audit to which the Company has responded and are presently under review with TÜV SÜD. The FDA accepts MDSAP audit reports as a substitute for routine Agency inspections. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 27 full time employees. Of these employees, eight were in research and development, eight in sales and marketing, five in production/distribution, and six in general and administrative services. One employee holds both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees and one employee holds an M.D. degree. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe that we have good employee relations.
We recruit employees with the skills and training relevant to functional responsibilities. As a small, innovative company focused on profitable growth, we believe that our future success largely depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We assess the likelihood that a particular candidate will contribute to the Company’s overall goals, and beyond their specifically assigned tasks. Depending on the position, our recruitment reach can be national as well as local.  We aim to provide market-based compensation and stretch incentives. We work to retain our employees for many years, as evidenced by the average 11 plus years' tenure of our workforce. New employees are provided industry-relevant compliance training and are introduced to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, with which all employees are required to annually confirm compliance. During 2021 and 2022, as we worked to manage through the effects of the pandemic, all employees were retained at full salary and, where possible, were provided the option of working remotely or at our Woburn facility with appropriate safeguards.
