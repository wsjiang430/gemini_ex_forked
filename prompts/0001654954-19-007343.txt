 Full-Service Brokerage — We offer full-service brokerage covering a broad array of investment alternatives including exchange-traded and over-the-counter corporate equity and debt securities, money market instruments, exchange traded options and futures contracts, government bonds, and mutual funds. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from commissions from clients through accounts with transaction-based pricing. Brokerage commissions are charged on investment products in accordance with a schedule we have formulated that aligns with local practices.
  
 In Russia we augment our retail brokerage services with banking services conducted in rubles and foreign currencies for individuals and legal entities. In accordance with federal law in Russia, the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia insures 100% of deposits of individuals up to 1.4 million Russian rubles (approximately $21,600 as of March 31, 2019). We generate revenue by providing services that include money transfers, foreign currency exchange, interbank lending, deposits, settlements and escrow services. Currently, we focus our banking services to support our securities brokerage customers. We are an authorized Visa/MasterCard issuer, and a participant in the Mir payment system in Russia. We issue multi-currency cards. We have introduced internet banking and mobile applications for Android/iOS for companies and individuals. In addition, we offer clients several investment and structured banking products (insured deposits with option features and currency risk hedging products).
  
 Margin Lending — We extend credit to customers, collateralized by securities and cash in the customer’s account, for a portion of the purchase price, and we receive income from interest charged on such extensions of credit. The customer is charged for such margin financing at interest rates established by us.
  
 Investor Education— We provide a variety of investment education and training courses to clients. We do not engage in asset or portfolio management nor do we engage in discretionary trading in our client account investment advisory services. Our clients are provided online access to tools that enable them to manage and monitor their accounts and portfolio performance via Tradernet.
  
 Investment Research —  We employ 13 securities analysts that conduct equity and debt research covering a number of individual securities worldwide. We provide regular research reports, notes and earnings updates to our clients. The research department supports our clients and sales department with equity and fixed-income research focused on the Kazakhstani, Ukrainian, Russian and US markets. Our research reports focus primarily on large, liquid public companies along with other linked commodities and currency markets. Our research reports are based on fundamental valuation and are typically issued on a quarterly-basis or when significant events occur. Our analysts also perform analysis of fixed-income securities and portfolios and provide research and analysis of market forecasts and macroeconomic conditions for certain industries.

  CAPITAL MARKETS
  
 Our success and growth in retail securities brokerage has allowed us to extend our activities and participation in the capital markets.
  
  Investment Banking
  
 We have established a team of investment banking professionals in Almaty and Moscow. Our investment banking division provides strategic advisory services and capital markets products. Our investment banking team focuses on certain sectors including consumer and business services, energy, financial institutions and real estate, technology, media and communications. Our investment banking activities are concentrated in Kazakhstan, Russia and Uzbekistan where the governments continue to privatize industries, but commercial banks concentrate their services on large enterprises or state-owned enterprises. In these countries, the commercial lending sources also impose loan structures and debt covenants that exclude many companies. This has created growing interest and demand in our services. To date our activities have been underwriting of debt and equity offerings on “best efforts” and firm underwriting bases.
  
  Equities Capital Markets —  We provide capital raising solutions for corporate clients through initial public offerings and follow-on offerings. We focus on companies in growth industries and participate as market makers in our underwritten securities offerings after the initial placements of shares.
  
  Debt Capital Markets — We offer a range of debt capital markets solutions for emerging growth and small market companies. We focus on structuring and distributing private and public debt, for various purposes including buyouts, acquisitions, growth capital financings, and recapitalizations. In addition, we participate in bond financings for both sovereign and corporate emerging market issuers.
  
  Proprietary Trading and Investment Activities
  
 In the regular course of our business, we take securities positions as a market maker and/or principal to facilitate customer transactions and for investment purposes. In making markets and when trading for our own account, we expose our own capital to the risk of fluctuations in market value. Investment decisions are determined in accordance with internal policy and recommendations of our internal investment committees. The size of our securities positions vary substantially based upon economic and market conditions, allocations of capital, underwriting commitments and trading volume. Additionally, we intend to move part of our proprietary trading portfolio to fixed income instruments. Also, the aggregate value of inventories of securities which we may carry is limited by the Net Capital Rule as in effect in the jurisdictions where we conduct our business. See “Regulatory Capital Requirements” herein and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report.

  Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
  
 Additionally, through the use of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities purchased under agreements to resell, we act as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders of short-term funds and provide funding for various inventory positions. We also employ repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements in our proprietary trading activities. For additional information regarding our repurchase and reverse repurchase activities see “Securities reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements” in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 18- Securities Repurchase Agreement Obligations of our consolidated financial statements. All references to our “consolidated financial statements” are to “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.
 Securities Lending
  
 In connection with both our trading and brokerage activities, we borrow securities to cover short sales and to complete transactions in which customers have failed to deliver securities by the required settlement date and lend securities to other brokers and dealers for similar purposes. We earn interest on our cash collateral provided and pay interest on the cash collateral received less a rebate earned for lending securities.
 EMPLOYEES
  
 Administration and operations personnel are responsible for the processing of securities transactions; the receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities; the maintenance of internal financial controls; accounting functions; custody of customers' securities; the handling of margin accounts for us and our correspondents; and general office services.
  
 At March 31, 2019, the Company employed 1,141 employees (1,064 full-time and 77 part-time), of whom 514 were retail financial advisers, 434 were operations personnel, 13 were research and securities analysts, 8 were capital markets team, 52 were MIS and IT systems personnel and 120 were administrative personnel.

  COMPETITION
  
 We face aggressive competition in each of the markets where we offer our services. We compete with international, regional and local brokerage, banking, and financial services firms that offer an array of financial products and services. The brokerage and financial service firms with which we principally compete for customers include: (i) BrokerCreditService and Finam in Russia; (ii) Halyk Finance, Sky Bridge Invest and First Heartland Securities in Kazakhstan; (iii) BrokerCreditService, Otkrytie and Zerich in Cyprus; (iv) Dragan Capital, Univer Capital and Investment Capital Ukraine in Ukraine; and (v) DALAL STANDARD, Portfolio Investments and TAT REESTR in Uzbekistan. While there are many large banks in Russia, FFIN Bank has identified its principal banking competitors as Tinkoff, BCS, Bank Otkritie and Finam.
  
 Many of the firms with which we compete are larger, provide additional and more diversified services and products, provide access to more international markets, and have greater technical, and financial resources. We leverage competitive advantages we have developed, including our extensive experience in providing local investors access to the U.S. and European securities markets, our ability to deliver high quality analytical information and our focus on providing convenient, high tech user friendly access to our services and the markets. We also believe we provide our customers advantages in their regional markets, particularly in the area of access to participation in IPOs of foreign issuers and well-known global companies. We have also been an active participant in various privatization programs, which has allowed us to develop expertise and a prominent reputation in the public placement of securities of local issuers in the regions where we operate.
  
  BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN
  
 We identify business continuity as the capability to continue the delivery of services to our clients, employees and various business partners and counterparties at acceptable predefined levels following a disruption that may occur in one or more business activities and/or in one or more operating locations due to local, national or regional disasters, or due to failure of one or more components of information technology infrastructure, including proprietary or self-developed information system, databases, software and hardware that we operate to provide such service. Since our operations are conducted through our subsidiary companies, our business continuity plans are developed locally by our subsidiaries to cover key business areas, provide contingency plans for IT infrastructure and communication to employees, clients and counterparties. Our operating subsidiaries in each geographical location rely on local public utilities for electric power with additional electric generator back up (if available). For telephone, internet and data center services besides primary on-site, we engage where available back up providers. All of these service providers have assured management of our subsidiary companies that they have plans for providing continued service in the case of an unexpected event that might disrupt their services. At the same time, our business continuity plans have little impact if a failure occurs from disruption of third-party service providers that cannot be replaced in a reasonable time by another provider due to uniqueness or special services, such as stock exchanges, depositories, clearing houses, clearing firms or other financial intermediaries used to facilitate our securities transactions. For this purpose, our subsidiaries have established constant and ongoing communication with the service providers to ensure timely receipt of data about their planned and actual activities. We are in process of developing uniformity across our subsidiaries to address business continuity by pursuing a standard for business continuity that will conclude ISO 22301 Societal security - Business continuity management systems.

  CYBERSECURITY
  
 Cybersecurity continues to be a growing priority for companies of all sizes, across all industries, especially in the financial services industry. Development of internet, cloud technologies and remote access to services has increased the risk of personal/sensitive/confidential data theft, unauthorized access to systems and databases, and interruption of business services to unprecedented levels. Recent security incidents have demonstrated the problematic element of cybersecurity is the constantly evolving nature of security risks, as new threats appear on a daily basis and bad actors are taking malware to new levels of sophistication and impact. Ransomware, malware, social engineering and phishing are key cybersecurity threats today. Traditional antivirus and next-generation antivirus are primarily designed to block file-based malware through scanning files on disk and quarantining malicious executables. Cybersecurity attacks have evolved to bypass antivirus protection through widespread adoption of fileless delivery techniques. Advisory organizations and regulatory bodies are requiring companies to provide more proactive, adaptive and sophisticated defenses. They also recommend a shift toward continuous monitoring and real-time assessment. We conduct ongoing planning and control of crucial areas of our business to detect and prevent cyber-attacks and to mitigate the risks of service disruption, loss of client, financial, confidential and other data with restricted or limited access. We are planning to implement additional standards that will be based on, but not limited to, ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management standards. See Risk Factors – “Interruptions in the proper functioning of our information technology, or “IT” systems, including from cybersecurity threats, could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs or decreases in revenues, or both” “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this annual report.
 REGULATORY OVERSIGHT
  
 We operate in a highly regulated industry. Our securities and banking business activities are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the stock exchanges, central/national banks, governmental and self-regulatory authorities in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business activities, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II and Regulation of the European Union, and certain laws of the United States. We expect that the regulatory environment will continue to raise standards and impose new regulation.
  
 In the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business we are subject to overlapping schemes of regulation that govern all aspects of our relationship with our customers. These regulations cover a broad range of practices and procedures, including:
  
  ● 
 minimum net capital requirements;

  ● 
 the use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities;

  ● 
 recordkeeping and reporting requirements;

  ● 
 client identification, clearance and monitoring to identify and prevent money laundering and funding of terrorism and facilitate FATCA reporting;

  ● 
 supervisory and organizational procedures intended to monitor and assure compliance with relevant laws and regulations and to prevent improper trading practices;

  ● 
 employee-related matters, including qualification and certification of personnel;

  ● 
 provision of investment and ancillary services, clearance, and settlement procedures;

  ● 
 maximum loan and bank guarantees concentration issued to shareholders;

  ● 
 credit risk requirements;

  ● 
 liquidity risk requirements;

  ● 
 acquisitions;

  ● 
 qualification of firm management; and

  ● 
 risk detection, management, and correction.

 The regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction where we operate establish minimum net capital requirements we must meet to maintain our licensure to conduct the brokerage and/or banking services we provide. These minimum net capital requirements currently range from approximately $30,000 to $4,635,000 and fluctuate depending on various factors. In the event we fail to maintain minimum net capital, we may be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of operations, and disqualification of our management from working in the industry.
  
 Compliance with minimum capital requirements could limit our expansion into activities and operations that require significant capital. Minimum capital requirements could also restrict our ability to transfer funds among our subsidiaries.
  
 Violations of securities, banking, anti-money laundering and financing of terrorism laws, rules and regulations can subject us to a broad range of disciplinary actions including imposition of fines and sanctions, other remedial actions, such as cease and desist orders, removal from managerial positions, loss of licensing, and civil and criminal proceedings.
  
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act—In the U.S., the 1970 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, broadly prohibits foreign bribery and mandates recordkeeping and accounting practices. The anti-bribery provisions make it illegal for us, either directly or through any subsidiary that we may acquire, to bribe any foreign official for the purpose of obtaining business. The term “public official” is defined broadly to include persons affiliated with government-sponsored or owned commercial enterprises as well as appointed or elected public officials. The recordkeeping provisions require that we and our subsidiaries make and maintain books that, in reasonable detail, reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets and devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls that enables us to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly recorded in accordance with management’s authorizations, that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements, that access to our funds and other assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s authorizations, and that the recorded accounts for assets are compared periodically with the existing assets to assure conformity.
  
 The FCPA requires that we establish and maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Failure to comply with the FCPA can result in substantial fines and other sanctions.
  
 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act—The 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, was enacted in the United States to target non-compliance by U.S. taxpayers using foreign accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions, such as the Freedom Companies, to report to the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest.

 The United States has entered into intergovernmental agreements with a number of countries establishing mutually agreed-upon rules for the implementation of the data sharing requirements of FATCA. It has not, however, entered into such an agreement with Russia. As a result, Russia adopted legislation to allow financial institutions to share foreign taxpayer data with foreign tax authorities, such as the IRS, without breaching Russian data protection and confidentiality laws. The Russian legislation sets forth extensive rules relating to when and how the financial institution may gather and share foreign taxpayer information. The Russian legislation establishes extensive monitoring procedures requiring, among other things, the notification to various Russian state bodies by the financial institution of registration with a foreign tax authority, receipt of requests for foreign taxpayer data, and the delivery to Russian state bodies of foreign taxpayer data prior to delivery to a foreign tax authority. Under the legislation, Russian regulators retain the right to prohibit disclosure of foreign taxpayer information in certain instances. Failure to comply with the Russian legislation may result in monetary fines for the financial institution and its officers. Because of the lack of an agreement between the U.S. and Russia establishing mutually agreed-upon guidelines for data sharing, inconsistencies in the two legal regimes exist, which can place financial institutions in Russia, such as Freedom RU and FFIN Bank, in the position of having to decide whether to comply with Russian legislation or with FATCA. For example, under Russian legislation, a financial institution may share foreign taxpayer data only with the consent of the foreign taxpayer, and even when consent is given, Russian regulators may, in certain circumstances, prohibit disclosure. There is no exemption for foreign financial institutions from the FATCA disclosure requirements. Similarly, FATCA generally requires foreign financial institution to withhold 30% of designated payments. However, the Russian legislation does not grant financial institutions the authority to act as a withholding agent for a foreign tax authority. The Russian legislation does allow financial institutions to decline to provide services to foreign taxpayers.
  
 Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan have entered into Model 1 intergovernmental agreements with the United States containing provisions regulating the process for financial institutions in these countries to collect information on U.S. taxpayer accounts and provide that information to the IRS. In general, the requirements of the agreements concern the analysis of new and existing customer accounts to identify U.S. taxpayers. The agreement requires financial institutions in these countries to identify their clients and analyze their products to identify the accounts of customers affected by FATCA and collect all necessary information to classify those accounts in compliance with the requirements of FATCA. After classifying the accounts, financial institutions are obligated to regularly present information, including name, taxpayer identification number, and account balance, to the local tax authorities for transfer to the IRS. The agreements also address when financial institutions in these countries are required to withhold taxes to be remitted to the IRS. Pursuant to these intergovernmental agreements, our subsidiaries in these countries are required to obtain client documentation associated with the indicia of his, her, or its U.S. tax residency status as well as related account information in order to report accordingly.
  
 The failure to comply with FATCA could result in adverse financial and reputational consequences to us as well as the imposition of sanctions or penalties including responsibility for the taxes on any funds distributed without the proper withholdings set aside.

  MONETARY POLICY
  
 Our earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Cyprus and the United States. The monetary policies of these countries may have a significant effect upon our operating results. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
