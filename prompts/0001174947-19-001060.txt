Item 1. Business.
General
 The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 13, 1963. On December 21, 2018, the Company changed its name from EnviroStar, Inc. to EVI Industries, Inc.
 The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is a value-added distributor, and provides advisory and technical services. Through the Company’s vast sales organization, it provides its customers planning, designing, and consulting services related to their commercial laundry operations. The Company sells and/or leases its customers commercial laundry equipment specializing in washing, drying, finishing, material handling, water heating, power generation, and water reuse applications. In support of the suite of products it offers, the Company sells related parts and accessories. Additionally, through the Company’s robust network of commercial laundry technicians, the Company provides its customers installation, maintenance, and repair services.
 The Company’s customers include retail, commercial, industrial, institutional, and government customers. Purchases made by customers range from parts and accessories, to single or multiple units of equipment, to large complex systems, as well as installation, maintenance and repair services.
 Prior to the completion of the Company’s first acquisition pursuant to its “buy-and-build” growth strategy in October 2016, the Company’s operations related to the activities described above consisted solely of the business and operations of Steiner-Atlantic Corp. (“Steiner-Atlantic”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Beginning in 2015, the Company implemented a “buy-and-build” growth strategy which includes (i) the consideration and pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions expected to complement the Company’s existing business or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities for, or benefit, the Company and (ii) the implementation of a growth culture at acquired businesses based on the exchange of ideas and business concepts among the management teams of the Company and the acquired businesses as well as through certain additional initiatives, which may include investments in new locations, additional product lines, expanded service capabilities and advanced technologies. See “Buy-and-Build Growth Strategy” below for additional information regarding the Company’s “buy-and-build” growth strategy, including information regarding the acquisitions consummated by the Company since its implementation of the “buy-and-build” growth strategy in 2015.
 The Company maintains a culture designed to reward performance through a variety of performance-based pay, commission programs, cash incentives, and stock-based equity programs. Stock-based plans include a voluntary employee stock purchase plan and equity compensation plans under which restricted stock and other equity awards are available for grant based generally on individual merit and measures of performance. The Company’s equity compensation plans are designed to promote long-term performance, as well as to create long-term employee retention, continuity of leadership, and an ownership culture whereby management and employees think and act as owners of the Company. The Company believes that its restricted stock program promotes this culture and long-term performance because restricted stock grants generally provide for long-term vesting, including in certain cases entirely at the end of the recipient’s career (age 62 or later) and, prior to vesting, these grants remain subject to forfeiture.
 The Company reports its results of operations through a single reportable segment.
 Available Information
 The Company files Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, files or furnishes Current Reports on Form 8-K, files or furnishes amendments to those reports, and files proxy and information statements with the SEC. These reports and statements, as well as beneficial ownership reports filed by the Company’s officers and directors and beneficial owners of 10% or more of the Company’s common stock, may be accessed free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC, on the Company’s website at http://www.evi-ind.com.

Products and Services
 The Company sells, rents and leases an extensive line of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and steam and hot water boilers manufactured by others, as well as related replacement parts and accessories, and provides installation and maintenance services.
 The commercial and industrial laundry equipment distributed by the Company includes washroom, finishing, material handling, and mechanical equipment such as washers and dryers, tunnel systems and coin-operated machines, many of which are designed to reduce utility and water consumption. Finishing equipment distributed by the Company includes sheet feeders, flatwork ironers, automatic sheet folders, and stackers. Material handling equipment distributed by the Company includes conveyor and rail systems. Mechanical equipment distributed by the Company includes boilers, hot water/steam systems, water purification, reuse and recycling systems and air compressors.
 Boiler products distributed by the Company include high efficiency, low emission steam boilers, steam systems and hot water systems that are used in the laundry and dry cleaning industry for temperature control, heating, pressing and de-wrinkling, and in the healthcare industry, food and beverage industry, and other industrial markets for sterilization, product sealing and other purposes.
 The Company also sells replacement parts and accessories for the products it distributes.
 In addition to its distribution of products, the Company also provides installation and maintenance services to its customers.
 The Company seeks to position and price its products to appeal to customers in each of the high-end, mid-range and value-priced markets, as the products are generally offered in a wide range of price points to address the needs of a diverse customer base. The Company believes that its portfolio of products affords the Company’s customers a “one-stop shop” for commercial, industrial and vended laundry and dry cleaning machines, boilers and accessories and that, as a result, the Company is able to attract and support potential customers who can choose from the Company’s broad product line. The Company believes its installation and maintenance services are competitively priced.
 Buy-and-Build Growth Strategy
 As described above, in addition to its pursuit of organic growth initiatives, the Company implemented a “buy-and-build” growth strategy in 2015. The “buy” component of the strategy includes the consideration and pursuit of acquisitions and other strategic transactions expected to complement the Company’s existing business or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities for, or benefit, the Company. The Company is disciplined and conservative in its consideration of acquisitions and generally seeks to identify opportunities that fit certain financial and strategic criteria. The “build” component of the strategy involves implementing a growth culture at acquired businesses based on the exchange of ideas and business concepts among the management teams of the Company and the acquired businesses as well as through certain additional initiatives, which may include investments in new locations, additional product lines, expanded service capabilities and advanced technologies. The Company generally seeks to structure acquisitions to include both cash and stock consideration. The Company believes the issuance of stock consideration aligns the interests of the sellers of the acquired businesses, who the Company generally seeks to maintain to continue to operate the acquired businesses, with the interests of the Company’s other stockholders. The sellers as well as other key individuals at the acquired businesses may also be provided with the opportunity to own shares of the Company’s common stock through equity-based plans of the Company.

Since the implementation of its “buy-and-build” growth strategy in 2015, the Company has consummated the following acquisitions:
 On October 10, 2016, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of Western State Design, LLC (“WSD”), a California-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry, for a purchase price consisting of $18.5 million in cash and 2,044,990 shares of the Company’s common stock.

The acquired businesses are based in Dallas and distribute commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provide installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry. The approximately $20.4 million of total consideration paid by the Company consisted of approximately $8.1 million in cash and 348,360 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company funded the cash consideration with borrowings under its credit facility at the time.
 
On September 12, 2018, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Scott Equipment, Inc.

On February 5, 2019, the Company acquired PAC Industries Inc. (“PAC”), a Pennsylvania-based distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry, pursuant to a merger whereby PAC merged with and into a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “PAC Acquisition”).

In addition to the SEI Acquisition and the PAC Acquisition, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), the Company completed the acquisition of four other companies: Industrial Laundry Services, Inc. (“ILS”) on September 4, 2018; Washington Automated, Inc. (“WAI”) on November 6, 2018; Skyline Equipment, Inc. (“Skyline”) on November 14, 2018; and Worldwide Laundry, Inc. (“WWL”) on November 16, 2018, each of which is a distributor of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and a provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry. The total consideration for these four transactions consisted of $3.5 million in cash (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments), net of $738,000 of cash acquired, and 141,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company funded the cash consideration for each acquisition with credit facility borrowings. The acquisitions of ILS, Skyline and WWL were structured as asset acquisitions. The acquisition of WAI was effected by the merger of WAI with and into a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Each transaction described above was effected by the Company, indirectly through a separate wholly-owned subsidiary formed by the Company for the purpose of effecting the transaction and operating the related business following the transaction. In connection with each asset acquisition, the Company, indirectly through its applicable wholly-owned subsidiary, also assumed certain of the liabilities of the acquired business. The financial position, including assets and liabilities, and results of operations of the acquired businesses following the respective closing dates are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
In addition, on August 1, 2019, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Commercial Laundry Products, Inc., Professional Laundry Systems of PA, Inc., and Professional Laundry Systems West, Inc., New York-based distributors of commercial, industrial, and vended laundry products and provider of installation and maintenance services to the new and replacement segments of the commercial, industrial and vended laundry industry. The consideration paid by the Company in connection with the transactions consisted of cash and stock and was immaterial to the Company on a consolidated basis.
 
Customers and Markets
 The Company’s customer base consists of approximately 50,000 customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. The Company’s commercial and industrial laundry equipment and boilers are sold or leased primarily to laundry plants, hotels, motels, restaurants, cruise lines, hospitals, hospital combines, nursing homes, government institutions, distributors, vended laundry facilities and specialized users. No single customer in terms of revenue generated for fiscal 2019 exceeded 10% of the Company’s revenues. Historically, the Company has not noted any significant seasonality.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
 The Company employs sales personnel to market its products in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. The Company has exclusive and nonexclusive distribution rights to market its products. Orders for equipment and replacement parts and accessories are generally obtained by telephone, e-mail and fax inquiries originated by the customer or by the Company, from existing customer relationships and from newly formed customer relationships. The Company supports its sales, rental and leasing activities through its websites and by advertising in trade publications, participating in trade shows and engaging in regional promotions and incentive programs.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company trains its employees to provide service and customer support. The Company uses in-person classroom training, instructional videos and vendor sponsored seminars to educate employees about product information. In addition, the Company’s technical staff has prepared training manuals, written in English and Spanish, relating to specific training procedures. The Company’s technical personnel are retrained as the Company believes to be necessary, including in connection with the development of new technology.
 Foreign Sales
 Substantially all of the Company’s revenues from foreign activities relate to the sale of commercial and industrial laundry and dry cleaning equipment and boilers to customers in Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America.
 All of the Company’s foreign sales require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located, as well as the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located.
 Sources of Supply
 The Company purchases commercial and industrial laundry products, dry cleaning machines, boilers and other products for distribution from a number of manufacturers and suppliers. Purchases from three manufacturers accounted for a total of approximately 62% of the Company’s product purchases for fiscal 2019 and purchases from four manufacturers accounted for approximately 76% of the Company’s product purchases for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”). No other manufacturers accounted for more than 10% of product purchases. The major manufacturers of the products sold by the Company are Alliance Laundry Systems, LLC, American Dryer Corporation, Chicago Dryer Company, Cleaver Brooks Inc., Continental Girbau, Inc., Dexter Laundry, Inc., FMB Group, Fulton Thermal Corp., Kannegiesser ETECH, Maytag Corporation, Pellerin Milnor Corporation, Unipress Corporation and Whirlpool Corporation. The Company has generally not experienced difficulty in purchasing products it distributes and believes that it has good working relationships with its current manufacturers and suppliers. The Company has contracts with several of the manufacturers and suppliers of the products which the Company sells and has established, long-standing relationships with most of its manufacturers and suppliers. The Company believes that such relationships provide the Company with certain competitive advantages, including exclusivity for certain products in certain areas and, in certain cases, favorable prices and terms. In connection with certain recent acquisitions, the business relationship between the acquired business and a principal supplier ceased. As a result, the businesses distributed other brands from one or more of the Company’s other suppliers. The Company does not believe that the brand switch had a material adverse impact on the Company as a whole. However, there is no assurance that the Company or any of its acquired businesses will maintain its relationships with any of its suppliers, and the loss of certain of these relationships, including the loss of a relationship with a principal supplier and any inability to successfully mitigate the effect of the loss of such supplier, could adversely affect the Company’s business and results. See also “The Company’s business and results may be adversely affected if the Company does not maintain its relationships with its significant suppliers or customers” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.

Due to special options and features on most of the larger and more expensive equipment ordered by customers, in most instances, the Company purchases the equipment distributed by it after its receipt of orders from its customers. However, from time to time, including in fiscal 2019, the Company may decide to purchase inventory in advance to take advantage of favorable pricing at the time or for other purposes, including to support the Company’s sales growth initiatives in new distribution territories and in support of growth initiatives related to the establishment of new manufacturer and supplier distribution relationships. The Company also maintains an inventory of more standardized and smaller-sized equipment that often requires more rapid delivery to meet customer needs.
 Competition
 The commercial and industrial laundry, dry cleaning equipment and boiler distribution business is highly competitive and fragmented, with over 500 full-line or partial-line equipment distributors in the United States. The Company’s management believes that no one competitor has a major share of the market, substantially all competitors are independently owned, and, with the exception of several regional distributors, distributors operate primarily in local markets. In the United States, the Company’s primary competition is from a number of independently owned distributors and certain manufacturers which own distribution businesses operating in North America. In foreign markets, the Company also competes with several independently owned distributors and manufacturer-owned distribution businesses. Competition is based primarily on a distributor’s ability to effectively plan and design optimal commercial and industrial laundry facilities, competitive pricing, representation of reliable and high-quality products, in-house installation, maintenance, and repair services, available and on-time delivery of equipment, parts, and accessories, and the ability to provide continuous support services to the customer. The Company seeks to compete in these areas by employing experienced and successful professionals, by offering a comprehensive product line, by employing a robust network of qualified installation and service technicians, by maintaining optimized inventories of equipment, parts, and accessories at well-located facilities and on service vehicles, by investing in advanced technologies that improve the customer experience, and by expansion of its suite of value-added services.
Research and Development
 The Company’s research and development efforts and expenses are generally immaterial as most of the Company’s products are distributed for manufacturers that perform their own research and development.
Service Marks and Tradenames
 The Company is the owner of the United States service mark registration for the name DRYCLEAN USA®, which is licensed by it to retail dry cleaning establishments. The Company intends to use and protect its service marks, tradenames and other intellectual property, as necessary.
Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Laws and Regulations
 Over the past several decades, federal, state and local governments in the United States and various other countries have enacted environmental protection laws in response to public concerns about the environment. A number of industries, including the commercial and industrial dry cleaning and laundry equipment industries, are subject to these evolving laws and implementing regulations. As a supplier to the industry, the Company serves customers who are primarily responsible for compliance with environmental regulations. Among the United States federal laws that the Company believes are applicable to the industry are the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), which provides for the investigation and remediation of hazardous waste sites, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”), which regulates the generation and transportation of hazardous waste as well as its treatment, storage and disposal, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (“OSHA”), which regulates exposure to toxic substances and other health and safety hazards in the workplace. In addition, most states and a number of local jurisdictions have laws that regulate the environment, which are at least as stringent as the federal laws. The Company is also subject to rules and regulations with respect to its contracts and dealings with government facilities.
   8

 
The Company does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local environmental and other laws and regulations which have been adopted have had, or will have, a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 Employees
 As of August 15, 2019, the Company had 475 employees. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.
