ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Phoenix Motor Inc., doing business as “Phoenix Motorcars” through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Cars LLC, Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC, and EdisonFuture Motor, Inc., is a leading electrification solutions provider for the commercial vehicle industry as well as other industries. Phoenix designs, develops, manufactures, assembles, and integrates electric drive systems and light and medium duty electric vehicles (“EVs”), with an aim to reduce carbon intensity and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The Company operates two primary brands, “Phoenix Motorcars” which is focused on commercial products including medium duty electric vehicles, chargers and electric forklifts, and “EdisonFuture” which intends to offer light-duty electric vehicles.
As an EV pioneer, we launched our first medium-duty electric drivetrain in 2009 and delivered our first commercial EV in 2014. In 2019, we launched our second generation (“Gen 2”) High Power Drive System for the Ford E450 chassis, the E-200. Since April 2021, we have been in production of our third generation (“Gen 3”) drivetrain (E-300). We are currently scheduled to release our fourth generation (“Gen 4”) drivetrain in mid-2023, which is expected to allow for substantially higher production volumes and achieve significant cost reduction.
Over the last six years we have developed and deployed for our customers all-electric shuttle buses, utility trucks, service trucks, cargo trucks and flatbed trucks. This differentiates us in the market where most commercial EV manufacturers are still in the prototype phase. As of December 31, 2022, we have delivered a total of 116 EVs to more than 42 customers, representing what we believe is the largest number of Class 4 cutaway medium duty electric shuttle bus deployments in the U.S. and the most electric vehicles deployed on the Ford E-Series chassis. With over four million zero-emission miles accumulatively driven by the vehicles we delivered, we have gained significant industry experience, distinct expertise and extensive knowledge in R&D, production, commercialization, customer engagement and validation of light and medium duty EVs, enabling us to drive continued design enhancements and innovations in our current and future generations drivetrain systems and other products. 
Market Opportunity
The commercial EV market, which we believe is currently underserved, is projected to grow from a low base today to global sales of three million units by 2025 and nine million by 2030, led by buses and light trucks, representing significant growth opportunities. Major factors driving the growth of the commercial EV market are rising policy support, increasing electrification of public transport fleets, stringent government regulations, advancements in battery pack technologies and electric powertrains and accelerated investment in charging infrastructure. By taking advantage of our proprietary technology, industry-leading experience and expertise, as well as increasing EV demand boosted by government incentives, grants and regulations, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the commercial market opportunities. 
Products
We sell our products both fully integrated into complete vehicles and in kit form to other business partners for integration into complete vehicles. We are currently in production of our Gen 3 drivetrain, which includes the largest battery pack and longest range for any Class 4 product on the market, offering up to 160 miles in range. We plan to start production of our Gen 4 vehicles before the third quarter of 2023, offering battery pack capacities of 90kWh and 150kWh with both “Buy America” and non “Buy America” options, allowing for flexibility in pricing and configuration primarily targeting the transit bus, school bus, airport shuttle, delivery truck and work truck segments. In particular, key features such as drivetrain design with batteries mounted within frame rails, energy efficient 750V architecture and fast, bi-directional charging will significantly improve vehicle safety and overall performance of our products.
Customers
The wide range of our medium-duty fleet customers include utilities, cities, municipalities, transit agencies, airports, hotels, seaports, school districts, parking companies, universities, and corporate campuses, with the configurations varying from shuttle buses, Type A school buses, utility trucks, service trucks, to flatbed trucks, walk-in vans, and cargo trucks.
As of December 31, 2022, our backlog of approximately 61 orders consists of 56 vehicles and 5 electric drive system kits. The order backlog represents $12.22 million of revenue, consisting of $11.88 million for vehicles and $0.34 million for electric drive systems.

Our Strategies
In addressing the market opportunities, we are to:

● | Pursue an asset light strategy. We’ve been actively building and expanding strategic partnerships and alliance in R&D, engineering and supply chain to accelerate the development and production of our solutions. Tapping into and leveraging the existing capabilities and infrastructure that our strategic partners have built, we are able to bring our solutions to market more quickly and cost efficiently, without the need to invest substantial amounts of capital. In addition, we are currently designing and executing a plan to utilize customer and third-party assembly facilities to boost production capacity with low capital requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Achieve scale. By standardizing and modularizing production and optimizing operations, we have a clear path to achieving significant scale in a cost-effective manner for our Gen 4 products and onward. The ongoing reconfiguration of our Anaheim facility is to not only ramp up production, but also to serve as a training and showcase facility to ensure procedures are standardized across our entire production network.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secure supply of key components for production. Benefiting from strong supply chain partnerships such as the one recently announced with CATL, the largest battery supplier in the world for the EV industry in terms of volume, for long term strategic supply of K-Pack batteries and related products, we’re addressing the challenges and constraints that have contributed to delivery delays in prior reporting periods.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce costs. We’re shifting from a strategy of focus on low volume, high customization products to one that will allow us to scale quickly, based on a change of vehicle design and engineering, standardization and modularization of processes and procedures and the use of standardized components and sub-assemblies. As we ramp up and further optimize supply chains and improve processes, we expect to substantially lower production and material costs for Gen 4 vehicles compared to that for Gen 3 vehicles, transforming the fundamentals of the business towards sustainably higher profitability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalize on increasing regulatory and customer demands. We believe the commercial EV space is at a significant inflection point driven by multiple tailwinds including regulations, corporate environmental mandates and state and federal grants. The growing supply chain maturity is also significantly increasing the economic attractiveness of EVs when compared with internal combustion engine vehicles. We will continue to aggressively pursue the increasing demand for EV adoption.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop a purpose-built, ground-up chassis and EdisonFuture platform. The development of our fifth generation (“Gen 5”) product will enable Phoenix to be chassis independent, removing one of the major impediments facing our businesses. It’ll also reduce material and production costs and allow us to customize vehicle designs to meet specialized needs, while maintaining standardized processes and procedures, increasing our capacity to accommodate customer requirements and meet the evolving needs of the electric vehicle market. Our EdisonFuture platform will benefit greatly from the development of prior generations, which will further lower costs and speed time-to-market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
Competition in the light and medium-duty truck industry is intense, as new regulatory requirements for vehicle emissions, technological advances and shifting customer demands are pushing the industry towards zero-emission solutions.
Phoenix competes with a number of commercial EV manufacturers, such as Lightning eMotors and Green Power Motor Company. Several major companies, including BYD, Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Daimler have begun entry into the commercial EV market. In addition, many of the aforementioned companies, along with others, such as Volvo, BYD, Hyundai, Honda, and Fiat participate in the hybrid combined electric and gasoline powered vehicle business, which includes commercial vehicles that may compete with Phoenix. Most of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do. They may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their electric truck programs. Additionally, those competitors have greater name recognition, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships and other resources than we do.

Sales and Marketing
We sell our vehicles to fleet customers directly and through our strategic relationships with premier commercial vehicle companies, including Matthews Specialty Vehicles, a leading manufacturer of specialty trucks and Pegasus Bus Company, a leading manufacturer of Type A school buses.
Manufacturing and Production
We currently carry out the production of our EV shuttle buses and trucks from a leased facility at 1500 Lakeview Loop, Anaheim, California (the “Anaheim Facility”). The Anaheim Facility is leased by us at a rent of $0.4 million per year and comprises 39,043 square feet of space consisting of 21,000 square feet of manufacturing floor and 18,043 square feet of office space. Our Anaheim Facility will allow us design, build and test prototype vehicles and components in-house. The lease on Anaheim Facility expires in March 2027.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 60 full-time employees based primarily in the greater Anaheim, California area. A majority of our employees are engaged in manufacturing functions. Our targeted hires typically have significant experience working for well-respected original equipment manufacturers, automotive engineering firms and software companies. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Government Regulation
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species; and the remediation of environmental contamination. We have been required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to Phoenix are established by the laws and regulations of the state and countries in which Phoenix operates, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, and possibly orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works.
In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.

Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation
Our vehicles are subject to, and comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards (“FMVSS”). As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that the vehicles meet or are exempt from all applicable FMVSSs before a vehicle can be imported into or sold in the U.S.
There are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:

● | Electric Vehicle Safety — limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Crash Tests for High-Voltage System Integrity — preventing electric shock from high voltage systems and fires that result from fuel spillage during and after motor vehicle crashes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the FMVSS rules, Phoenix designs our vehicles to meet the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which prescribes requirements for bus and truck fleet owners. These include standards for defrosting and defogging systems and speedometers, as well as safety features such as steps and handholds.
We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements and federal laws administered by NHTSA, including early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports, foreign recalls and owner’s manual requirements.
Altoona Testing
Under the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (“STURAA”), federal funding of acquisition of a new model bus is unavailable unless a bus of that model has been tested for safety, structural integrity, durability, performance, maintainability, noise and fuel economy. Testing is conducted at the Larson Transportation Institute’s Bus Research and Testing Center in Altoona, Pennsylvania established for that purpose.
Vehicles that are built to Buy America compliant standards and have passed Altoona testing are eligible for FTA funding of up to 80% of the capital cost of a transit vehicle. Failure to complete testing in this timeframe would materially adversely affect order fulfillment, as well as future sales, to customers and potential customers that require successful completion of the test program.
EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”), concerning emissions for our vehicles. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and an Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. CARB sets the California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. There are currently four states which have adopted the California standard for heavy-duty vehicles.
The Greenhouse Gas Rule was incorporated into the Clean Air Act on August 9, 2011. Since our vehicles have zero-emissions, Phoenix is required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for the Greenhouse Gas Rule, and a CARB Executive Order for the CARB Greenhouse Gas Rule. Phoenix received the CARB Executive Order for its range of all-electric shuttle buses, trucks and school buses in November 2021 and application for the Executive Order for the 2022 Model Year vehicles is in process.
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Credits — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles under the Greenhouse Gas Rule, Phoenix will earn tradable credits that under current laws and regulations can be sold. Under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, each BEV earns a credit multiplier of 4.5 for use in the calculation of emission credits. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the nitrogen oxide emission standard for each type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to lower the emission requirement over time, increasing the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard. Until technology catches up for commercial vehicles, manufacturers of diesel trucks will need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The Greenhouse

Gas Rule provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation does not limit the number of battery-electric credits sold within the same commercial vehicle category.
Greenhouse Gas Credits — California Air Resources Board
California has a greenhouse gas emissions standard which follows very closely to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standard. The delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles in California under the Greenhouse Gas Rule will earn Phoenix tradable credits that can be sold. Under CARB greenhouse gas regulations, each BEV will also earn a credit multiplier of 4.5 for use in the calculation of emission credits. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the nitrogen oxide emission standard for each type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to lower the emission requirement over time, increasing the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard.
Until technology catches up for commercial vehicles, manufacturers of diesel buses and trucks will need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The California timeline for reaching very low GHG emissions is more aggressive than the EPA. Commercial vehicle manufacturers will look to cover their emission deficits first for California. The Greenhouse Gas Rule provides an opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation does not limit the number of battery-electric credits sold within the same commercial vehicle categories.
