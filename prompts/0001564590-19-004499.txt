ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Sleep Number Corporation, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was founded in 1987 and became publicly traded in 1998. We are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ Global Select Market) under the symbol “SNBR.” When used herein, the terms “Sleep Number,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sleep Number Corporation, including consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Our mission is to improve lives by individualizing sleep experiences. Our vision is to become one of the world's most beloved brands by delivering an unparalleled sleep experience. We expect to achieve our goals by executing our consumer innovation strategy with three significant competitive advantages: proprietary sleep innovations, exclusive retail distribution and lifelong customer relationships.
 
As a purpose-driven brand and the leader in sleep innovation, Sleep Number delivers proven quality sleep through effortless, adjustable comfort and biometric sleep tracking. We are visionary leaders in sleep and wellness and are redefining what consumers should expect from their bed. Our vertically integrated business model and role as the exclusive designer, manufacturer, marketer, retailer and servicer of Sleep Number® beds allows us to offer consumers high-quality, individualized sleep solutions and services. As a direct-to-consumer brand, we offer a cohesive experience across our Sleep Number® stores, online at SleepNumber.com and via phone at (800)753-3768. We also offer mattress home-delivery/installation and maintain an in-house customer service department.
 
In 2018, we revolutionized sleep with our complete line of Sleep Number 360® smart beds. The 360® smart bed, at the forefront of the digital health and wellness revolution, is rapidly becoming the “hub” for a healthy life by delivering proven quality sleep. It is the only bed in the world that offers SleepIQ® technology, a proprietary sensor technology that tracks each sleeper’s individual data, including movement, breathing rate, heartbeat and sleep habits. The SleepIQ technology platform captures over 8.5 billion biometric data points every night, building one of the most comprehensive databases of biometric sleep data in the world. Today, the 360 smart bed uses this data to automatically adjust the comfort of the bed for proven quality sleep. In the future, this high-quality data will likely enable customers to use their smart bed to manage their health and wellness. Through daily digital interactions that build lifelong relationships, SleepIQ technology also communicates how you slept and provides insight into what adjustments you can make, including adjusting your Sleep Number® setting, to optimize your sleep and improve your daily life.
 
Our commitment to quality, value and service has been widely recognized, including being ranked #1 in Customer Satisfaction with Mattresses by J.D. Power in 2018 and the best in six out of seven categories (support, durability, comfort, variety of features, value and warranty). Sleep Number has received the highest score in the 2015, 2016 and 2018 Mattress Satisfaction Report. Sleep Number ranked 27 points above the industry average in 2018.

We are committed to delivering superior shareholder value by: (1) increasing consumer demand; (2) leveraging our business model; and (3) deploying capital efficiently. Over the past six years, we have transformed the business with $481 million of capital expenditures and acquisitions, while building vital new demand-driving capabilities. This effort has positioned us for accelerated profits and cash generation. In 2018, we increased net sales by 6% to $1.53 billion and increased earnings per diluted share by 24% to $1.92.
 
Social Impact Commitment
 
Because excellent sleep is essential to a healthier and happier society, we are committed to helping future generations achieve quality sleep. In 2018, we announced a social impact commitment to help one million young people achieve life-changing sleep through our products and sleep expertise by 2025. Since announcing this commitment, we have already donated more than $1 million and helped to improve the lives of nearly 100,000 youth through our partnerships with Good360, GenYOUth and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.
Proprietary Sleep Innovations
 
As the creator and leader of the “sleep tech” category, Sleep Number introduced the revolutionary Sleep Number 360 smart bed at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2017 and completed the transition to all 360 smart beds in 2018. The winner of 13 CES innovation awards and the Edison Award for breakthrough product design and innovation in the Wellness Technology category, the 360 smart bed uses the sleeper’s movements and biometrics to automatically adjust the bed’s firmness throughout the night, providing the highest quality sleep.
 
Unlike the “one-size-fits-all” solution offered by other mattress brands, the Sleep Number 360 smart bed offers individualized comfort that is adjustable on each side of the bed. Our proprietary DualAirTM technology features two independent air chambers and allows couples to adjust firmness to their individual preference at the touch of a button. Each sleeper can set their ideal firmness, support and pressure-relieving comfort – their Sleep Number® setting – for deep, restful sleep. 
 
SleepIQ technology, our proprietary sleep tracking technology, is the bed’s operating system. It measures the user's sleep, continuously gathering hundreds of biometric readings per second, including average heart rate, breathing rate and movement. Using these measurements, the 360 smart bed automatically adjusts the firmness to keep each sleeper comfortable throughout the night. This data also enables our proprietary algorithm to deliver a daily SleepIQ® score from 1 to 100, helping sleepers understand how restful their sleep was the night before. Over time, we expect SleepIQ technology to provide individualized insights so the sleeper knows how to improve their health and wellness.
 
The Sleep Number 360 smart bed includes additional smart features, like foot warming, which gently warms your feet to help you fall asleep faster. The 360 smart bed also connects seamlessly with other smart devices, like the Nest Learning ThermostatTM and fitness trackers like Apple® HealthKit or Fitbit®, to help sleepers understand how daily activities impact their sleep. The Sleep Number 360 smart bed is more than just a bed – it’s the center of health and wellness.
 
The Sleep Number 360 smart bed is available at our Sleep Number stores and online at SleepN
umber.com, with pricing starting at $999. We offer our beds in good, better and best price ranges within the premium mattress category. Our Classic, Performance and Innovation lines come in a broad range of sizes, including twin, full, queen, eastern king and California king. 
 
Additional Sleep Number Innovations
 
We also offer a full line of exclusive FlexFitTM smart adjustable bases that allow customers to raise the head or foot of the bed. Our industry-leading FlexFit bases seamlessly integrate with SleepIQ to deliver features like our Partner SnoreTM technology, which allows your partner to press a button and raise the head of the bed to temporarily relieve snoring. 
 
The SleepIQ Kids® k2 bed extends Sleep Number's DualAir adjustability and SleepIQ technology to the children's mattress market. The k2 bed adjusts with children as they grow, giving them the best possible sleep.
Our exclusive Sleep Number® bedding collection features a full line of sleep products that are designed to help you get better sleep. Sleep Number has a wide assortment of pillows designed to fit each individual's size, shape and sleeping position for a more comfortable sleep. 
 
We also offer a wide assortment of temperature-balancing products including the DualTemp® layer. This proprietary sleep innovation features active air technology that allows each sleeper to select their ideal temperature at the simple touch of a button and can be used with any mattress brand or adjustable base.

Exclusive Distribution
 
Over 99% of our net sales are generated by our direct-to-consumer business, through a cohesive experience across our Sleep Number stores, online at SleepNumber.com and via phone. 
 
As the exclusive distributor of Sleep Number products, we target high-quality, convenient and visible store locations based on several factors, including each market’s overall sales potential, store geographic location, demographics and proximity to other specialty retail stores. Since 2012, we have overhauled our direct-to-consumer distribution strategy, repositioning a large percentage of our mall stores to stronger, out-of-mall locations, improving the size and positioning within each location and adding stores in both existing and new markets. As of December 29, 2018, there were 579 Sleep Number stores in all 50 states, 41% more than six years ago. Approximately 55% of our stores (including remodels) are less than five years old. With these investments, we created an exclusive, value-added retail in-store experience through award-winning store design, technology enhancements and stores that are about 50% larger on average. 
 
Our sleep experts in each store recognize that sleep is not “one size fits all” and provide individualized sleep solutions for each person. Shopping online is easy, too, at SleepNumber.com. Working in conjunction with our retail stores, we have a cohesive online experience that helps customers easily research our products and solutions, find and purchase products online, and receive post-sales support. Our omni-channel experience expands our digital brand, connecting with consumers to drive deeper awareness, consideration and engagement.
 
Our retail stores accounted for 91.5% of our net sales in 2018. Average annual net sales per store, based on Company-Controlled comparable sales, were $2.7 million in 2018. In 2018, 98% of our stores open for a full year, generated net sales over $1 million and 65% of our stores open for a full-year generated net sales over $2 million. We now have 25% of our stores delivering greater than $3 million in annual net sales. In 2018, our online and phone sales accounted for 7.6% of our net sales and increased double digits year-over-year. Wholesale/Other channel accounted for 0.9% of our net sales in 2018.
 
Marketing
 
We use a wide-ranging set of marketing and advertising instruments to expand brand reach, drive emotional brand engagement and create lifelong customer relationships. This relationship with our customers is an effective driver of repeat purchases and new customers referrals. Our marketing efforts target a broad customer demographic: 35-64 years old with greater than $75,000 household income for our core line of products. Our customers care about their own and their family's sleep quality and know that it leads to better overall health and well-being.
 
Marketing drives growth in our business by building brand relevance, reputation, awareness, consideration and ongoing engagement through integrated and authentic communications that amplify the value of the 360 smart bed. This results in increased quality traffic to our website and stores. Our advertising communications use a mix of national and local marketing to target existing customers for referral and repeat purchases and to attract new customers. Television is our most efficient media, followed by digital and social media. Our in-house digital capabilities, content marketing, user experience and data-driven tools allow us to optimize media investment, messages and audience in real-time. In 2018, media expense represented 13.7% of net sales.
 
In early 2018, we entered into a multi-year, strategic partnership as the Official Sleep and Wellness Partner of the National Football League (NFL) to broaden brand reach and engagement, amplify the benefits of our 360 smart beds and link quality sleep to performance. We also established partnerships with the NFL Players Associations (NFLPA) and the Professional Football Athletic Trainers Society (PFATS). After year one of our partnership with the NFL, most active NFL players have Sleep Number 360 smart beds, which are helping players compete more effectively by measuring, understanding and maximizing the benefits of a great night's sleep. Sleep Number will continue to work with the NFL, the NFLPA, PFATS, trainers, teams and players as they integrate sleep insights into their overall performance regimens.
 
Operations
 
Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We have two manufacturing plants located in Irmo, South Carolina and Salt Lake City, Utah. The manufacturing operations in South Carolina and Utah consist of cutting and sewing of the fabric covers for our beds and final assembly and packaging of mattresses and bases. In addition, our electrical Firmness ControlTM systems are assembled in our Utah plant.
 
We obtain all the raw materials and components used to produce our beds from outside sources. A number of components, including our air chambers, our adjustable foundations, various components for our Firmness Control systems, as well as fabrics and zippers, are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as our sole or primary source of supply for these components. We believe we can obtain these raw materials and components from other sources of supply, although we could experience some short-term disruption in our 
 5


ability to fulfill orders in the event of an unexpected loss of supply from one of our primary suppliers. We utilize dual sourcing on targeted components when effective.
 
We have taken, and continue to take, various measures to mitigate the potential impact of an unexpected disruption in supply from any sole-source suppliers, including increasing safety stocks and identifying potential secondary sources of supply. All the suppliers that produce unique or proprietary products for us have in place either contingency or disaster recovery plans, or redundant production capabilities in multiple locations in order to safeguard against any unforeseen disasters. We review these plans and sites on a regular basis to ensure the suppliers' ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of materials and components.
 
Historically, we manufactured our bed components in our two plants and completed final bed assembly in customers’ homes. We are pursuing a multi-year evolution to enable delivery of assembled mattresses to customers’ homes. Since 2017, we have opened three assembly distribution centers to assemble beds prior to delivery: Irmo, South Carolina, Salt Lake City, Utah and Baltimore, Maryland. We expect to expand this capability to approximately six assembly distribution centers over the next few years. We are also advancing our outbound logistics network to reduce product handling, hand-offs, damage and costs while in transit to customers’ homes. We see these initiatives providing a superior and reliable experience for customers with lower costs for the business.
 
Home Delivery Service
 
In July 2018, we completed the transition of our entire core mattress line to 360 smart beds. With this change, 100% of our 360 smart beds sold are now delivered and installed by our home delivery technicians or by our third-party service providers in certain markets.
Customer Service
 
Through our U.S.-based, in-house customer service team, we provide direct post-purchase support and are able to develop one-to-one relationships that improve the customer experience and drive our business. This team provides service and support via phone, email, “live chat” and social media. They also provide a unique opportunity to gather insights that help us continuously improve our product, strengthen our service quality and advance our innovation. This integration enables operational synergies and drives organizational efficiencies.
Research and Development
 
As the leader in consumer-driven sleep innovation, Sleep Number conducts extensive research to understand consumers’ needs and operates R&D facilities in San Jose, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota. This research drives the design and delivery of our award-winning sleep innovations, our customer experience and our proprietary SleepIQ technology. As consumers are rapidly adopting new digital tools and using their personal data to improve health and wellness, developing new technology that improves the quality of sleep and overall wellness of our customers will remain a top priority for Sleep Number. Our research and development expenses were $29 million in 2018, $28 million in 2017 and $28 million in 2016.
Information Systems
 
We use information technology systems to operate, analyze and manage our business, to reduce operating costs and to enhance our customers' experience. Our major systems include an in-store order entry system, a retail portal system, a payment processing system, in-bound and out-bound telecommunications systems for direct marketing, delivery scheduling and customer service, e-commerce systems, a data warehouse system and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. These systems are primarily comprised of packaged applications licensed from various software vendors plus a limited number of internally developed programs. Please refer to the information set forth in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, for a discussion of certain risks that may be encountered in connection with our information systems.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of our products, including air control systems, remote control systems, air chamber features, mattress construction, foundation systems, sensing systems, as well as other technology. We have numerous U.S. patents, expiring at various dates between February 2019 and February 2037 and numerous U.S. patent applications pending. We also have numerous foreign patents and patent applications pending. Notwithstanding these patents and patent applications, we cannot ensure that these patent rights will provide substantial protection or that others will not be able to develop products that are similar to or competitive with our products.

Industry and Competition
 
The U.S. bedding industry, including mattresses and foundations, is a mature and generally stable industry. According to the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA), the industry has grown by approximately 4% annually over the last 20 years and at an estimated 4% annually, on average, over the past five years. We believe that industry unit growth has been primarily driven by population growth, an increase in the number of homes (including secondary residences) and the increased size of homes. We believe growth in average wholesale prices resulted from a shift to both larger and higher-quality beds, which are typically more expensive. According to ISPA and Company estimates, industry wholesale shipments of mattresses and foundations (excluding adjustable bases) were approximately $8.2 billion in 2018 compared to $8.4 billion in 2017. Furniture/Today, a furniture industry trade publication, has ranked Sleep Number as the 5th largest mattress manufacturer and 2nd largest U.S. bedding retailer for 2017, with an 8% market share of industry retail revenue.
 
The retail bedding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. Our Company-Controlled distribution channel is exclusive, and we compete against regional and local specialty bedding retailers, home furnishing stores, mass merchants, national discount stores and online marketers. Our consumer innovation strategy with exclusive distribution is highly differentiated, and results in a retail-leading customer experience.
 
Manufacturers in the bedding industry compete on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance, including the perceived levels of comfort and support provided by a mattress. There is a high degree of concentration among manufacturers, who produce innerspring, memory foam and hybrid beds, under nationally recognized brand names, including Tempur Sealy, Stearns & Foster, Serta and Simmons. In recent years, numerous (approximately 200) direct-to-consumer companies and low-cost importers have entered the market, offering “bed-in-a-box” products to consumers primarily through the Internet. These companies market directly to consumers, competing primarily on convenience of online shopping and speed of delivery. Their products are generally foam-based and undifferentiated in terms of sleep benefits.
 
Governmental Regulation and Compliance
 
As a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting all aspects of our business.
 As a manufacturer, we are committed to product quality and safety, including adherence to all applicable laws and regulations affecting our products. Compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, including the federal fire retardant standards developed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which requires rigorous and costly testing, has increased the cost and complexity of manufacturing our products and may adversely impact the speed and cost of product development efforts. Further, our manufacturing and other business operations and facilities are, or may, become subject to additional federal, state or local laws or regulations relating to supply chain transparency, conflict minerals sourcing and disclosure, end-of-life disposal and recycling requirements, and other laws or regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety requirements.
 As a retailer, we are subject to additional laws and regulations that apply to retailers generally and govern the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of both our retail stores and our e-commerce activities. Many of the statutory and regulatory requirements which impact our retail and e-commerce operations are consumer-focused and pertain to activities such as the advertising and selling of credit-based promotional offers, truth-in-advertising, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements, accessibility and similar requirements.

All of our operations are or may become subject to federal, state and local labor laws including, but not limited to, those relating to occupational health and safety, employee privacy, wage and hour, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity and employee leaves and benefits. We are also subject to existing and emerging federal and state laws relating to data security and privacy.
 It is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance.
 
Customers
 
No single customer accounts for 10% or more of our net sales.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is modestly impacted by seasonal influences inherent in the U.S. bedding industry and general retail shopping patterns. The U.S. bedding industry generally experiences lower sales in the second quarter of the calendar year and increased sales during selected holiday or promotional periods.
Working Capital
 
We are able to operate with minimal working capital requirements because we sell directly to customers, utilize a primarily hybrid "make-to-stock" production process and operate retail stores that serve mainly as showrooms. We have historically generated sufficient cash flows to self-fund operations through an accelerated cash-conversion cycle. In February 2019, we amended our revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks (Lenders). The Credit Agreement provides a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with net aggregate availability of $450 million. The Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the amount of the credit facility from $450 million up to $600 million in total availability, subject to Lenders' approval. The Credit Agreement matures in February 2024.
 
Qualified customers are offered revolving credit to finance purchases through a private-label consumer credit facility provided by Synchrony Bank. Approximately 50% of our net sales in 2018 were financed by Synchrony Bank. Our current agreement with Synchrony Bank expires December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination upon certain events. We pay Synchrony Bank a fee for extended credit promotional financing offers. Under the terms of our agreement, Synchrony Bank sets the minimum acceptable credit ratings, the interest rates, fees and all other terms and conditions of the customer accounts, including collection policies and procedures. As the receivables are owned by Synchrony Bank, at no time are the receivables purchased or acquired from us. We are not liable to Synchrony Bank for our customers' credit defaults. In connection with all purchases financed under these arrangements, Synchrony Bank pays us an amount equal to the total amount of such purchases, net of promotional related discounts, upon delivery to the customer. Customers that do not qualify for credit under our agreement with Synchrony Bank may apply for credit under a secondary program that we offer through another provider.
 
Team Members
 
At December 29, 2018, we employed 4,220 individuals, including 2,167 retail sales and support team members, 382 customer service team members, 1,185 manufacturing and logistics team members, and 486 management and administrative team members, of which 59 were employed on a part-time or temporary basis. Except for managerial team members and professional support staff, all of our team members are paid on an hourly basis (plus commissions for sales professionals). Additionally, we provide various broad-participation incentive compensation programs tied to various performance objectives. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We regularly survey our team members with regard to engagement, and review engagement metrics and input with team members. We have a highly engaged team working in a values-driven culture, which we believe is important for an innovation company with an aspirational vision and life-changing mission.
