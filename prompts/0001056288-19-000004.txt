ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
General
Federated Investors, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Hermes Fund Managers Limited (Hermes) beginning July 1, 2018 (collectively, Federated), is a leading provider of investment management products and related financial services. Federated has been in the investment management business since 1955 and is one of the largest investment managers in the United States (U.S.) with $459.9 billion in assets under management (AUM or managed assets) at December 31, 2018.
Federated operates in 1 operating segment, the investment management business. Federated sponsors, markets and provides investment-related services to various investment products, including sponsored investment companies and other funds (Federated Funds) and Separate Accounts (which include separately managed accounts (SMAs), institutional accounts, sub-advised funds and other managed products) in both domestic and international markets, as well as provides stewardship services to various companies. Federated's principal source of revenue is investment advisory fee income earned by various domestic and/or foreign subsidiaries pursuant to investment advisory contracts and based primarily upon the AUM of the investment products. Domestic subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), while foreign subsidiaries are registered in the U.S and/or with foreign regulators.
Federated provides investment advisory services to 130 Federated Funds as of December 31, 2018. Federated markets these funds to banks, broker/dealers and other financial intermediaries who use them to meet the needs of customers and/or clients (collectively, customers), including retail investors, corporations and retirement plans. As of December 31, 2018, the Federated Funds are domiciled in the U.S., as well as Ireland, the United Kingdom (UK), the Cayman Islands and Canada. Most of Federated's U.S.-domiciled funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) and under other applicable federal laws. Each U.S.-domiciled registered fund enters into an advisory agreement that is subject to annual approval by the fund's board of directors or trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons, as defined under the 1940 Act, of the funds or Federated. In general, material amendments to such advisory agreements must be approved by the funds' shareholders. These advisory agreements are generally terminable upon 60 days' notice to the investment advisor. See Potential Adverse Effects of Termination or Failure to Renew Advisory Agreements in Item 1A - Risk Factors for additional information on Federated's advisory agreements.
Of the 130 Federated Funds as of December 31, 2018, Federated's investment advisory subsidiaries managed 28 money market funds totaling $208.5 billion in AUM, 47 fixed-income funds with $40.5 billion in AUM, 38 equity funds with $36.6 billion in AUM, 11 alternative/private markets funds with $11.4 billion in AUM and 6 multi-asset funds with $3.9 billion in AUM.
As of December 31, 2018, Federated provided investment advisory services to $159.0 billion in Separate Account assets. These Separate Accounts represent assets of government entities, high-net-worth individuals, pension and other employee benefit plans, corporations, trusts, foundations, endowments, sub-advised funds and other accounts or products owned or sponsored by third parties. Fees for Separate Accounts are typically based on AUM pursuant to investment advisory agreements that are generally terminable upon notice to Federated (or, in certain cases, after a 30 day, 60 day or similar notice period).
Certain Federated Funds have adopted distribution plans that, subject to applicable law, provide for payment to Federated for distribution services. These distribution plans are implemented through distribution agreements between Federated and the Federated Funds. Although the specific terms of each such agreement vary, the basic terms of the agreements are similar. Pursuant to these agreements, Federated acts as underwriter for the funds and distributes shares of the funds primarily through unaffiliated dealers. Each distribution plan and agreement is initially approved by the directors or trustees of the respective fund and is reviewed for approval by such directors or trustees annually as required under applicable law.
Federated also provides a broad range of services to support the operation and administration of the Federated Funds. These services, for which Federated receives fees pursuant to agreements with the Federated Funds, include administrative services and shareholder servicing.
On July 2, 2018, Federated completed, effective as of July 1, 2018, the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hermes (Hermes Acquisition). As a result of the Hermes Acquisition, Federated now also provides stewardship services and industry-leading environmental, social and governance (ESG) integrated investment strategies. Through the stewardship services, Federated offers clients a range of solutions for engagement, advocacy, active ownership and impact and delivers effective engagement with the companies in which they invest. Federated integrates ESG factors into, or considers ESG factors in connection with, certain of its investment strategies and processes to seek long-term performance for its customers and clients.

Total AUM are composed of Federated Funds and Separate Accounts and represent the balance of AUM at a point in time. Total managed assets for the past two years were as follows:

 | As of December 31, | | 2018vs. 2017 | 
dollars in millions | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 
Equity | $ | 72,497 | | | $ | 62,816 | | | 15 | %

Total Managed Assets | $ | 459,860 | | | $ | 397,570 | | | 16 | %


1 | Alternative/Private Markets at December 31, 2018 includes $8.3 billion of fund assets managed by a non-consolidated entity, Hermes GPE LLP, in which Hermes holds an equity method investment.

Average managed assets represent the average balance of AUM during a period of time. Because substantially all revenue and certain components of distribution expense are generally calculated daily based on AUM, changes in average managed assets are typically a key indicator of changes in revenue earned and asset-based expenses incurred during the same period. Average managed assets for the past three years were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, | | 2018 vs. 2017 | | | 2017 vs. 2016 | 
dollars in millions | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 
Equity | $ | 70,680 | | | $ | 60,255 | | $ | 53,492 | | 17 | % | 13 | %
Fixed-Income | 63,454 | | | 55,204 | | | 51,161 | | 15 | | 8 | 
Alternative / Private Markets1 | 9,397 | | | 441 | | | 650 | | NM | | (32 | )

Total Average Managed Assets | $ | 415,388 | | | $ | 366,421 | | $ | 362,938 | | 13 | % | 1 | %


1 | Alternative/Private Markets for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes $4.1 billion of average fund assets managed by a non-consolidated entity, Hermes GPE LLP, in which Hermes holds an equity method investment.

Changes in Federated's average asset mix year-over-year across both asset classes and product/strategy types have a direct impact on Federated's operating income. Asset mix impacts Federated's total revenue due to the difference in the fee rates earned on each asset class and product/strategy type per invested dollar. Generally, management-fee rates charged for advisory services provided to equity and multi-asset products and strategies are higher than management-fee rates charged to fixed-income and alternative/private markets products and strategies, which are higher than management-fee rates charged to money market products and strategies. Likewise, Federated Funds typically have a higher management-fee rate than Separate Accounts. Additionally, certain components of distribution expense can vary depending upon the asset class, distribution channel and/or the size or structure of the customer relationship. Federated generally pays out a larger portion of the revenue earned from managed assets in money market and multi-asset funds than the revenue earned from managed assets in equity, fixed-income and alternative/private markets funds.
Revenue
Federated's revenues from investment advisory, administrative and other service fees over the last three years were as follows:
 | Year Ended December 31, | | 2018vs. 2017 | | | 2017vs. 2016 | 
dollars in thousands | 2018 | | | 2017 | | | 2016 | |

Investment Products and Strategies
Federated offers a wide range of products and strategies, including money market, equity, fixed-income, alternative/private markets and multi-asset investments. Federated's offerings include products and strategies that Federated expects to be in demand under a variety of economic and market conditions. Federated has structured its investment process to meet the requirements of fiduciaries and others who use Federated's suitable products and strategies to meet the needs of their customers. Fiduciaries typically have stringent demands regarding portfolio composition, risk and investment performance.
Federated is one of the largest U.S. managers of money market assets, with $301.8 billion in AUM at December 31, 2018. Federated has developed expertise in managing cash for institutions, which typically have strict requirements for regulatory compliance, relative safety, liquidity and competitive yields. Federated began selling money market fund products to institutions in 1974. Federated also manages retail money market products that are typically distributed through broker/dealers. At December 31, 2018, Federated managed money market assets across a wide range of categories: government ($203.5 billion); prime ($87.6 billion); and tax-free ($10.7 billion).
Federated's equity assets totaled $72.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and are managed across a wide range of categories including: value and income ($32.5 billion); international/global ($24.1 billion); growth ($13.2 billion); and blend ($2.7 billion). 
Federated's fixed-income assets totaled $63.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and are managed across a wide range of categories including: multisector ($37.0 billion); high-yield ($10.1 billion); municipal ($5.1 billion); U.S. corporate ($4.9 billion); U.S. government ($3.0 billion); international/global ($2.2 billion); and mortgage-backed ($0.9 billion).
Federated's alternative/private markets and multi-asset investments totaled $18.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Federated's alternative/private markets assets are managed across a wide range of categories including: real estate ($8.6 billion); private equity ($4.1 billion); infrastructure ($4.1 billion); and other alternative ($1.5 billion).
Investment products are generally managed by a team of portfolio managers supported by fundamental and quantitative research analysts. Federated's proprietary, independent investment research process is centered on the integration of several disciplines including: fundamental research and credit analysis; ESG integrated investment strategies; quantitative research models; style-consistent and disciplined portfolio construction and management; performance attribution; and trading.
See Note (5) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on revenue concentration risk.
Distribution Channels and Product Markets
Federated's distribution strategy is to provide investment management products and services to more than 9,500 institutions and intermediaries including banks, broker/dealers, registered investment advisors, government entities, corporations, insurance companies, foundations and endowments. Federated uses its trained sales force of nearly 250 representatives and managers backed by an experienced support staff to offer its products and strategies, add new customer relationships and strengthen and expand existing relationships.
Federated's investment products and strategies are distributed in three markets. These markets and the relative percentage of managed assets at December 31, 2018 attributable to such markets are as follows: U.S. financial intermediary (64%); U.S. institutional (23%); and international (13%).
U.S. Financial Intermediary. Federated distributes its products and strategies in this market through a large, diversified group of over 2,500 national, regional and independent broker/dealers, banks and registered investment advisors. Financial intermediaries use Federated's products to meet the needs of their customers, who are often retail investors. Federated offers a full range of products to these customers, including mutual funds, separate accounts and private funds. As of December 31, 2018, managed assets in the U.S. financial intermediary market included $215.7 billion in money market assets, $45.1 billion in equity assets, $32.2 billion in fixed-income assets, $3.2 billion in multi-asset and $0.3 billion in alternative/private markets assets.
U.S. Institutional. Federated offers its products and strategies to a wide variety of domestic institutional customers including government entities, not-for-profit entities, corporations, corporate and public pension funds, foundations, endowments and non-Federated investment companies or other funds. As of December 31, 2018, managed assets in the U.S. institutional market included $76.8 billion in money market assets, $25.3 billion in fixed-income assets, $3.2 billion in equity assets and $0.8 billion in multi-asset.
International. Federated manages assets from institutional and financial intermediary customers outside the U.S. through subsidiaries focused on gathering assets in Europe, the Middle East, Canada, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. The 2018 Hermes Acquisition expanded the distribution footprint of Federated outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, 
6

managed assets in the international market included $24.2 billion in equity assets, $18.0 billion in alternative/private markets assets, $9.3 billion in money market assets and $5.7 billion in fixed-income assets. 
Competition
As of December 31, 2018, Federated had $300.8 billion of Federated Fund AUM and $159.0 billion of Separate Account AUM. Of the Separate Account AUM, $21.9 billion related to SMAs. 
The investment management business is highly competitive across all types of investment products and strategies, including mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), SMAs, institutional accounts, sub-advised funds and other managed products and strategies. Competition is particularly intense among mutual fund and ETF providers. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of 2018, there were over 8,000 open-end mutual funds and nearly 2,000 ETFs of varying sizes and investment objectives whose shares are currently being offered.
In addition to competition from other mutual fund managers, ETF providers and investment advisors, Federated competes with investment alternatives offered by insurance companies, commercial banks, broker/dealers, deposit brokers, other financial institutions, and hedge funds.
Competition for sales of investment products and strategies is influenced by various factors, including investment performance, attainment of stated objectives, yields and total returns, fees and expenses, advertising and sales promotional efforts, investor confidence and preference, relationships with intermediaries and type and quality of services.
Regulatory Matters
Federated and its investment management business are subject to extensive regulation both in and outside the U.S. Federated and its products, such as the Federated Funds, and strategies are subject to: federal securities laws, principally the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act), the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act; state laws regarding securities fraud and registration; regulations or other rules, promulgated by various regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges; and foreign laws, regulations or other rules promulgated by foreign regulatory or other authorities. See Item 1A - Risk Factors under the caption Potential Adverse Effects of Changes in Laws, Regulations and Other Rules on Federated's Investment Management Business for additional information.
Current Regulatory Environment - Domestic 
While the pace of new regulation slowed in 2018, and the possibility for a similar pace in 2019 exists, the regulatory environment continues to evolve. While certain regulatory initiatives were abandoned or modified amidst calls for deregulation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), among other regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations or exchanges, continued to propose new rules and regulations in 2018 and will continue to do so going forward. Certain previously adopted rules and regulations also became effective in 2018 or will become effective in 2019. The rules and regulations that have or are expected to become effective, and any new proposed rules and regulations, continue to impact the investment management industry (collectively, both domestically and abroad, as applicable, Regulatory Developments). 
The calls for deregulation first began through a series of Executive Orders and Presidential Memoranda issued in the first quarter of 2017. This was followed by a U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) report on asset management and insurance in October of 2017 (Treasury Asset Management Report), in which the Treasury Department made various recommendations for deregulation of the asset management industry, including, among others, a recommendation to eliminate Dodd-Frank Act-imposed stress testing requirements for investment advisors and investment companies in favor of stress testing requirements under Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act (Rule 2a-7). Deregulation also is a focus of certain legislative efforts. The House Financial Services Committee advanced a bill seeking to reverse certain aspects of money market fund reform and a hearing on that bill was held in the Senate in June 2018, and efforts continue in Congress to get this legislation passed and signed into law. The proposed law would permit the use of amortized cost valuation by, and override the floating NAV and certain other requirements for, institutional and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds. These requirements were imposed under the SEC's structural, operational and other money market fund reforms adopted through amendments to Rule 2a-7, and certain other regulations, on July 23, 2014 (2014 Money Fund Rules) and related guidance (collectively, the 2014 Money Fund Rules and Guidance). Compliance with the 2014 Money Fund Rules and Guidance became effective on October 14, 2016.
The current regulatory environment has affected, and is expected to continue to affect, to varying degrees, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Increased regulation and Regulatory Developments have required, and are expected to continue to require, additional internal and external resources to be devoted to technology, legal, compliance, operations and other efforts to address regulatory-related matters, and have caused, and may continue to cause, product structure, pricing, offering and development effort adjustments, as well as changes in asset flows and mix, customer 
7

relationships, revenues and operating income. Given the slowed pace of regulation and calls for deregulation, the degree of impact of Regulatory Developments can vary and is uncertain.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the SEC proposed or adopted new rules that impact U.S. investment management industry participants, including Federated. For example:

• | On December 19, 2018, the SEC proposed rule 12d1-4, and amendments, under the 1940 Act, designed to streamline and enhance the regulatory framework for funds that invest in other funds (or "fund of funds" arrangements), and rescinded rule 12d1-2 under the 1940 Act and most related exemptive orders granted by the SEC to provide relief from Sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), (C) and (G) of the 1940 Act. The SEC also proposed related amendments to rule 12d-1 under the 1940 Act and Form N-CEN. The proposed rule would, under certain specified conditions, permit a fund to acquire shares of another fund in excess of the limits of section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act without obtaining an exemptive order from the SEC. Specifically, proposed rule 12d1-4 would: (1) prohibit an acquiring fund, except one that is part of the same group of investment companies as the acquired fund or one that has a sub-advisor that acts as advisor to the acquired fund, from controlling an acquired fund and requires an applicable acquiring fund that holds more than 3% of an acquired fund's outstanding voting securities to vote those securities in a prescribed manner in order to minimize influence over the acquired fund; (2) prohibit an acquiring fund that acquires more than 3% of an acquired fund's outstanding voting securities from redeeming more than 3% of the acquired fund's total outstanding securities in any 30-day period; (3) impose conditions designed to prevent duplicative and excessive fees in fund of funds arrangements by requiring an evaluation of aggregate fees associated with the investment in the acquired fund and the complexity of the fund of funds arrangement; and (4) prohibit funds from creating three-tier fund of fund structures, except in certain limited circumstances. Rule 12d1-2, which is proposed to be rescinded, permits funds that primarily invest in funds within the same group of investment companies to invest in unaffiliated funds and certain non-fund assets. The proposed amendments to rule 12d1-1 would allow funds that primarily invest in funds within the same group of investment companies to continue to invest in unaffiliated money market funds. Finally, the amendments to Form N-CEN would require funds to report whether they relied on rule 12d1-4 or the statutory exception in Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the 1940 Act during the applicable reporting period. The public comment period on the proposed rule ends 90 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register. Federated is analyzing the potential impact that the proposed rule, if adopted as proposed, would have on Federated's fund of fund arrangements and relevant products and, as of December 31, 2018, Federated is unable to determine the impact on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.


• | On November 30, 2018, the SEC adopted a new rule under the 1933 Act to establish, subject to certain conditions, a non-exclusive safe harbor for an unaffiliated broker or dealer participating in a securities offering of a covered investment fund to publish or distribute a covered investment fund research report. The rule was first proposed by the SEC on May 23, 2018. Under the new rule, a broker-dealer's publication or distribution of research reports that satisfy the conditions in the rule would be deemed, for purposes of Sections 2(a)(10) and 5(c) of the 1933 Act, not to constitute an offer for sale or offer to sell a covered investment fund's securities. The new rule generally became effective on January 14, 2019.

Investment management industry participants, such as Federated, also continued, and will continue, to monitor, plan for and implement certain changes in response to new proposed or adopted rules, such as the following, which Federated previously described in greater detail in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018:

• | Three new SEC proposals were issued on April 18, 2018, including Regulation Best Interest, clarifications on an investment advisor's fiduciary duty and a short client or customer relationship summary report (Form CRS). In a December 6, 2018 speech, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton indicated that a key priority for the SEC in 2019 is to finalize Regulation Best Interest, which, if adopted as proposed, would require broker-dealers to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities and to put the retail customer's interests ahead of the broker-dealer's interests when making recommendations. Moreover, until Regulation Best Interest is finalized, it remains uncertain whether, and to what degree, broker-dealers or other intermediaries will roll-back or continue changes made prior to the Department of Labor's rule imposing a modified fiduciary standard for retirement plan advisors (DOL Fiduciary Rule) having been vacated in its entirety in mid-2018, such as eliminating commission-based compensation arrangements, reducing the number of mutual funds offered on their platforms or requiring "clean shares" or other product fee structure changes based on SEC guidance. It is also uncertain to what degree a final Regulation Best Interest may impact the types of products that intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, may offer to their customers, and to what degree, if any, such an impact may have on demand for Federated's products and services or how they are offered and sold.


• | An SEC request for comment was issued on June 5, 2018 seeking public input on enhancing mutual fund, ETF and other investment fund disclosures to improve the investor experience and help investors to make informed investment decisions.

8

Among other matters, it also solicits feedback on investor preferences for means of delivery and how to make better use of 21st century technology, including how to make disclosures more interactive and personalized. The public comment period ended on October 31, 2018.

• | Rule 30e-3 under the 1940 Act (Rule 30e-3), adopted by the SEC on June 6, 2018, creates an optional "notice and access" method for delivering shareholder reports through website posting in lieu of mailing. Subject to certain accessibility, quarterly holdings availability, formatting, notice, print upon request, and paper copy election conditions in the rule, the rule will allow funds to deliver their shareholder reports by making them publicly accessible on a website, free of charge, and sending investors a paper notice of each report's availability by mail. Federated intends to rely on Rule 30e-3 and the Federated Funds registered under the 1940 Act began including the required notice to shareholders in annual reports to fund shareholders and fund prospectuses beginning January 1, 2019.


• | In light of the adoption of Rule 30e-3, the SEC also issued on June 5, 2018, a request for public comment and additional data on the current processing fee framework intermediaries charge for forwarding fund materials, such as shareholder reports and prospectuses, to beneficial shareholders under current rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and other self-regulatory organizations, to better understand the potential effects on funds and their investors. The public comment period ended on October 31, 2018.


• | The SEC adopted amendments on June 28, 2018 to the public liquidity-related disclosure requirements for open-end mutual funds to assist in providing investors with accessible and useful information about the liquidity risk management practices of the funds in which they invest. Under the amendments, funds will be required to discuss in their annual or semi-annual shareholder reports the operation and effectiveness of their liquidity risk management program, replacing a pending requirement that funds publicly provide the aggregate liquidity classification profile of their portfolios on Form N-PORT. This rule became effective on September 10, 2018, with a compliance date for the Form N-PORT amendments being June 1, 2019, and a compliance date for the shareholder report disclosure requirements of December 1, 2019, for larger fund complexes.


• | The SEC proposed rule 6c-11 under the 1940 Act (Rule 6c-11) on June 28, 2018, which would permit ETFs that satisfy certain conditions to operate without the expense and delay of obtaining an exemptive order, impose certain enhanced disclosure requirements regarding ETF trading costs, and amend Form N-CEN to require ETFs to report whether they rely on Rule 6c-11 and to report additional information to allow the SEC to confirm compliance with Rule 6c-11. The public comment period on the proposed rule ended on October 1, 2018.


• | The SEC issued on June 28, 2018, a final rule that requires, among other things, the use of the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL) format for the submission of operating company financial statement information and fund risk/return summary information. The new rule became effective on September 17, 2018, and must be complied with by large mutual fund complexes, such as the Federated Funds, beginning September 17, 2020, and for public companies, such as Federated, with respect to fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2019.


• | While the SEC's proposed derivatives rule, which was issued on December 11, 2015 and would increase the regulation of the use of derivatives by investment companies, remains on the SEC's 2019 regulatory agenda, the SEC is considering issuing a new proposed derivatives rule later in 2019, which signals that this proposed rule will be modified from the SEC's original proposal. Among other recommendations on derivatives regulation, the Treasury Asset Management Report recommended that the SEC consider a derivatives rule that would include a derivatives risk management program and an asset segregation requirement, but reconsider what, if any, portfolio limits should be part of the rule.


• | The SEC adopted rules on October 13, 2016 relating to the modernization of investment company reporting and disclosure, the enhancement of liquidity risk management by open-end investment companies and the permitted use of "swing pricing" by open-end investment companies. Under the reporting modernization rules, the Federated Funds that are registered under the 1940 Act were required to report on Form N-CEN beginning in June 2018. For larger fund complexes, such as Federated's, required information for Form N-PORT was required to be compiled, maintained and made available to the SEC from and after June 1, 2018 and filing of Form N-PORT will be required beginning April 30, 2019. Regarding the liquidity management rules, compliance with disclosure and certain other elements of the rules was required by June 1, 2017. Federated established its liquidity risk management program by December 1, 2018, as required for larger fund complexes. The rules' limitation of illiquid investments to 15% of net assets also took effect on December 1, 2018. The SEC postponed the requirement to report on Form N-LIQUID until April 1, 2019, in light of the cyber incident disclosed by the SEC in September 2017, and the implementation of the liquidity bucketing requirement until June 1, 2019. Based on comments from certain SEC Commissioners, industry participants, including Federated, requested that the SEC consider eliminating the bucketing requirements because, among other reasons, they are highly burdensome, defective and costly,

9

and will not provide the SEC or fund managers with meaningful insights into fund liquidity during times of market stress or other intended benefits. As of December 31, 2018, management does not believe there is interest in the U.S. fund industry generally to adopt swing pricing.
In addition to the above Regulatory Developments, the SEC staff has been engaging in a series of investigations, enforcement actions and/or examinations involving investment management industry participants, including investment management companies and investment advisors. The number of SEC examinations increased in 2018 by 10% over 2017, and the number of SEC enforcement actions against investment advisors and investment companies also increased in 2018 over 2017. The SEC examinations have included certain sweep examinations of investment management companies and investment advisors involving various topics, including, but not limited to, compliance with the 2014 Money Fund Rules and Guidance, "distribution in guise," marketing support payments, intermediary and other payments and related disclosures, the impact of the UK's vote to exit the European Union (EU) (known as "Brexit"), share class selection, fixed-income and high yield liquidity, liquidity controls, liquid alternatives and cybersecurity. The SEC staff focused on cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, wrap fee programs, mutual funds and ETFs, disclosure of costs of investing and retirement products as examination priorities in 2018, and has announced that it will focus on matters important to retail investors, compliance in registrants responsible for critical market infrastructure, digital assets, cyber security and anti-money laundering, among other matters, as examination priorities in 2019. Over the past three years, the SEC staff also issued various guidance statements on cyber-security, investment company business continuity, mutual fund distribution, revising fund disclosures in light of changing market conditions, inadvertent custody, and sales load variation disclosure, among other topics. On October 11, 2018, the SEC also adopted a Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022 that describes using the SEC's examination resources to bolster regulatory requirements and protect investors. These investigations, actions and examinations have led, and may lead, to further regulation, guidance statements and scrutiny of the investment management industry. Given government regulatory policies, the changes in SEC management, and the possibility of a continuing slower pace for new regulation in the U.S., the degree to which regulatory investigations, actions and examinations will continue, as well as their frequency and scope, can vary and is uncertain.
Regulation or potential regulation by regulators other than the SEC also continued, and may continue, to affect investment management industry participants, including Federated. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) also has undertaken examinations, including, for example, a cybersecurity sweep examination, and various state legislatures or regulators have adopted or are beginning to adopt state-specific cybersecurity and/or privacy requirements that may apply, to varying degrees, in addition to federal regulation. 
The activities of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) also continue to be monitored by the investment management industry, including Federated. Since FSOC indicated in 2014 that it intended to monitor the effectiveness of the 2014 Money Fund Rules, concerns persisted that FSOC may recommend new or heightened regulation for "non-bank financial companies," which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Governors) have indicated can include open-end investment companies, such as money market funds and other mutual funds. The Treasury Asset Management Report, noting that entity-based systemic risk evaluations of asset managers or their funds are generally not the best approach for mitigating risk, recommended that, while the FSOC should maintain a risk identification and evaluation function, the FSOC should look to the SEC to address systemic risks through regulation within and across the asset management industry in the U.S. While the FSOC has since moved away from potential systemically important financial institution designations of asset managers or investment products in favor of studying and evaluating the financial stability implications of the asset management sector, the FSOC continues to focus on risks facing the investment management industry, and review and monitor SEC efforts on reporting modernization, liquidity management and derivatives. In its 2018 Annual Report published on December 19, 2018, FSOC recommended that the SEC monitor the implementation of these rules and evaluate the extent to which they address potential risks in the asset management industry. While its focus appears to have shifted, and while legislative and other efforts continue to improve its transparency and operation, the FSOC retains its authority to designate non-bank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions. Based on the foregoing, the degree to which actions by the FSOC can impact the investment management industry, including Federated, remains uncertain.
The current regulatory environment has impacted, and will continue to impact, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. For example, changes required under the 2014 Money Fund Rules and Guidance resulted in a shift in asset mix from institutional prime and municipal (or tax-exempt) money market funds to stable NAV government money market funds across the investment management industry, and at Federated, which impacted its AUM, revenues and operating income. Management continues to believe that, if interest rates continue to rise, money market funds will benefit generally from increased yields, particularly as compared to deposit account alternatives, and that, as spreads widen, investors who exited prime money market funds will likely continue to reconsider their investment options over time, including Federated's prime private money market fund and prime collective fund. While 2018 did see a shift in asset mix back toward 
10

institutional prime and municipal (tax-exempt) money market funds, there is no guarantee such shift will continue and return the asset mix between institutional prime, municipal (or tax-exempt) and government money market funds to pre-October 2016 levels; therefore, the degree of improvement to Federated's prime money market business can vary and is uncertain.
The changes made in response to the DOL Fiduciary Rule, and the proposed Regulation Best Interest, if adopted as proposed, impacted, or likely may impact, Federated's AUM, revenues and operating income. For example, while the extent to which broker-dealers and other intermediaries will roll-back actions taken to comply or to prepare to comply with the vacated DOL Fiduciary Rule remains uncertain, if intermediaries continue to reduce the number of Federated Funds offered on their platforms, mutual fund-related sales and distribution fees earned by Federated may decrease. In that case, similar to other investment management industry participants, Federated could experience a further shift in asset mix and AUM, and a further impact on revenues and operating income. On the other hand, management continues to believe that Federated's business may be positively affected because separately managed account/wrap-fee strategies work well in level wrap fee account structures and can provide transparency and potential tax advantages to clients, while Federated's experience with bank trust departments and fiduciary experience and resources presents an opportunity to add value for clients. 
Federated has dedicated, and continues to dedicate, significant internal and external resources to analyze and address Regulatory Developments, and their effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. This effort includes considering and/or affecting legislative, regulatory, product structure and development, information system development, reporting capability, business and other options that have been or may be available in an effort to minimize the potential impact of any adverse consequences. Federated's efforts include having conversations with intermediary customers regarding Regulatory Developments, and analyzing product offering and structure adjustments, regulatory alternatives and other means to comply, and to assist its customers to comply, with new fiduciary rules, the 1940 Act and other applicable laws and regulations. Among other actions, Federated developed an educational website to assist clients with compliance with the DOL Fiduciary Rule (now vacated), increased the number of Federated Funds that offer clean shares, including R6 shares, and added T Shares, which currently are not being offered, to 33 Federated Funds. As appropriate, Federated participated, and will continue to participate, either individually or with industry groups, in the comment process for proposed regulations. Federated also continues to expend legal and compliance resources to examine corporate governance and public company disclosure proposals issued by the SEC and to adopt, revise and/or implement policies and procedures and to respond to examinations, inquiries and other matters involving its regulators, including the SEC, customers or other third parties. Federated continues to devote resources to technology and system investment, cybersecurity and information governance, and the development of other investment management and compliance tools, to enable Federated to, among other things, be in a better position to address new or modified regulatory requirements. The Regulatory Developments discussed above, and related regulatory oversight, also impacted, and/or may impact, Federated's customers and vendors, their preferences and their businesses. For example, these developments have caused, and/or may cause, certain product line-up, structure, pricing and product development changes, as well as money market, equity, fixed-income, alternative/private markets or multi-asset fund products to be less attractive to institutional and other investors, reductions in the number of Federated Funds offered by intermediaries, changes in the fees Federated, retirement plan advisors and intermediaries will be able to earn on investment products and services sold to retirement plan clients, and reductions in AUM, revenues and operating profits. In addition, these developments have caused, and/or may cause changes in asset flows, levels and mix, as well as customer relationships.
Federated will continue to monitor Regulatory Developments as necessary, and may implement additional changes to its business and practices as it deems necessary or appropriate. Further analysis and planning, or additional refinements to Federated's product line and business practices, may be required in response to market, customer or regulatory changes and developments, such as further money market fund regulation or potential deregulation, new fiduciary rules and other Regulatory Developments, or any additional regulation or guidance issued by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
Management believes that the floating NAV, and fees and gates, required by the 2014 Money Fund Rules, as well as other Regulatory Developments, have been and will continue to be detrimental to Federated's fund business. In addition to the impact on Federated's AUM, revenues, operating income and other aspects of Federated's business described above, on a cumulative basis, Federated's regulatory, product development and restructuring, and other efforts in response to the Regulatory Developments discussed above, including the internal and external resources dedicated to such efforts, have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Federated's expenses and, in turn, financial performance. As of December 31, 2018, given the current regulatory environment, the possibility of future additional or modified regulation or oversight, and the possibility for a continuing slower pace for new regulation in the U.S., Federated is unable to fully assess the impact of adopted or proposed regulations, and other Regulatory Developments, and Federated's efforts related thereto, on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. The regulatory changes and developments in the current regulatory environment, and Federated's efforts in responding to them, could have a material and adverse effect on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, while the FSOC's change in focus and 
11

continuing FSOC transparency efforts have reduced the possibility of any Federated products being designated a systemically important non-bank financial company by the FSOC, in management's view any such designation, the issuance of final regulations pertaining to systemically important non-bank financial companies, and any reforms ultimately put into effect would be detrimental to Federated's money market fund business and could materially and adversely affect Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated also is unable to assess at this time whether, or the degree to which, any continuing deregulation efforts or potential options being evaluated in connection with regulatory changes and developments ultimately may be successful.
International
With UK Parliament rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit withdrawal agreement on January 15, 2019, the Prime Minister is continuing negotiations with the EU Parliament to avoid the possibility of Brexit occurring on March 29, 2019, without a withdrawal agreement governing the UK's separation from the EU (a so called "hard Brexit"). As negotiations continue, concerns continue regarding the value of the British Pound Sterling, the UK's credit rating, the impact on the financial markets, and the legal and regulatory impact of a hard Brexit, including, among other potential impacts, on the ability of investment management industry participants to offer and sell UK-based products in the EU and EU-based products in the UK.
Among other terms, the proposed withdrawal agreement rejected by the UK Parliament contained the following components: (A) maintaining a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products, other than common agricultural and fishery policies, but not services; (B) ensuring a fair trading environment through reciprocal commitments relating to state aid and cooperative arrangements between regulators on competition and maintaining high regulatory standards for the environment, climate change, social issues, employment, and consumer protection; (C) establishing a joint institutional framework to provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements in the UK and EU courts and appropriate resolution of disputes, including through the establishment of a joint committee of representatives from the UK and EU; and (D) developing a new business-friendly customs model and facilitated customs arrangement that operates as a combined customs territory and removes the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and EU. Under this arrangement, the UK would have applied UK tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the UK and the EU's tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the EU. The proposed withdrawal agreement also included a backstop plan that would have kept the UK in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade deal could be agreed upon to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. 
Since the January 15, 2019 rejection of the proposed withdrawal agreement, Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly escaped a no confidence vote in UK Parliament on January 16, 2019. Debate has also continued in the UK Parliament. On January 21, 2019, the Prime Minister delivered a speech to UK Parliament in which she declined to support measures to avoid or delay Brexit, including conducting a new Brexit referendum vote or revoking the UK's Article 50 notice, indicated she would be more flexible in engaging UK Parliament on withdrawal agreement negotiations, and committed to seeking the strongest possible protections on workers' rights and the environment and to ensuring no hard border in Northern Ireland. On January 28, 2019, the UK Parliament voted on seven amendments to the proposed withdrawal agreement: (1) an amendment to avoid a no deal Brexit and to seek a form of customs union (defeated); (2) an amendment that would extend Article 50 to the end of 2019 if a deal was not secured by late February 2019 (defeated); (3) an amendment to allow UK Parliament to take control in creating a series of indicative votes (defeated); (4) an amendment indicating that the UK would not leave the EU without a deal (passed, but it is only advisory and does not have legislative force); (5) an amendment to seek a two year extension of Article 50 if there is not a deal in place by February 26, 2019 (defeated); (6) an amendment to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland (passed); and (7) an amendment calling for an extension of Article 50 and removing a no deal Brexit as an option (defeated). With the passing of two amendments by the UK Parliament, Prime Minister Theresa May indicated that she would return to Brussels to continue negotiations with the European Commission. Promptly after the UK Parliament's vote on the amendments, a spokesman from the EU released a statement indicating that the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. It is uncertain to what degree EU Parliament will change its position and be receptive to renegotiating the proposed withdrawal agreement.
Given the uncertainty surrounding whether a withdrawal agreement can be reached, the process for agreeing and implementing the UK's withdrawal from the EU may result in a hard Brexit or a compromised withdrawal agreement by March 29, 2019, or may extend beyond that date. As time passes without a withdrawal agreement in place, significant political, economic, legal and regulatory uncertainty is likely to continue to increase. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks of political instability, currency abandonment and other market disruptions on Federated and its business. The UK's exit from the EU also will likely affect the requirements and/or timing of implementation of legislation and regulation applicable to doing business in the UK, including the laws and regulations applicable to Federated, as well as to the sponsoring, management, operation and distribution of Federated's products and services, both in and outside the UK. For example, while EU Directives have been approved by the UK Parliament, EU regulations generally are effective in the EU without local parliament action and will need to be approved by the UK Parliament to remain in effect post-Brexit. If the UK does not remain part of the single European 
12

market in connection with a hard Brexit, the ability to passport fund distribution and management services could be eliminated between the UK and EU, increasing regulatory burdens and compliance and other costs for UK funds being distributed in the EU and EU funds (such as Irish-domiciled funds) being distributed in the UK. The ability to engage investment managers for EU funds and UK funds also could be impacted, resulting in structural and other changes for UK- and EU-domiciled funds. It also remains unclear whether Brexit may impact various initiatives underway in the EU, such as money market fund reform and the implementation of a financial transactions tax (FTT). Despite the disagreement on the withdrawal agreement, UK and EU regulators are beginning to take steps to address the uncertainty created by a potential hard Brexit. For example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and other EU regulators have agreed to two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) that cover cooperation and exchange of information in the event the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal agreement and an implementation period. Specifically, the MoUs are multilateral MoUs, one with the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) National Competent Authorities (NCAs) covering supervisory cooperation, enforcement and information exchange; and one with ESMA covering supervision of Credit Rating Agencies and Trade Repositories. The FCA also is implementing a temporary permissions regime that, if a hard Brexit occurs, will allow EEA-domiciled investment funds that market in the UK under a passport to continue temporarily marketing in the UK, and will allow EEA-based firms currently passporting into the UK to continue new and existing regulated business within the scope of their current permissions in the UK for a limited period, while they seek full FCA authorization. EU governments, such as France, the Netherlands and Italy, also are beginning to adopt similar temporary permission regimes or other laws to permit UK products to be sold for a period of time in their countries in the event of a hard Brexit. Federated is monitoring the impact of Brexit, and, while Brexit has not had a significant impact on Federated's business as of December 31, 2018, Federated remains unable to assess the degree of any potential impact Brexit, and resulting changes, may have on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated continues to expend internal and external resources on contingency planning for Brexit, but the uncertainty around the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU make such planning difficult. For example, Hermes organized a subsidiary based in Dublin, Ireland, and established offices in Germany and Denmark, as part of Brexit contingency planning for its business. The Hermes Acquisition increases the potential impact Brexit, and resulting changes, may have on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
The EU Securitization Regulation became applicable on January 1, 2019 for originators, sponsors, lenders, securitization special purpose entities, and institutional investors, including, among others, UCITs funds, alternative investment fund managers and investment firms. Among other requirements, this regulation establishes requirements for due diligence, risk retention and transparency of disclosures for those involved in securitization transactions. For example, the regulation requires investors to conduct due diligence, and to maintain written policies on due diligence and monitoring. The EU also will insist on investors only investing in products where the originator, lender or sponsor maintains at least a 5% retention in the product, even if another country (such as the U.S.) removes their requirement for a 5% risk retention. The regulation also requires the performance of stress tests on cash flows and collateral values or, in the absence of stress testing, testing based on assumptions having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of risk positions. The regulation also requires internal reporting to a relevant management body so that such management body is aware of material risks and can ensure that they are appropriately managed. Finally, under the regulation, the originators, sponsors or lenders involved with a securitized product have to agree amongst themselves to publish information that will be publicly available via repositories that will enable investors to more easily conduct due diligence when investing in securitized products. 
The European Commission has issued four legislative proposals relating to its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance, and a further Action Plan, including a timetable for all actions, is expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2019. The legislation addresses, among other things, the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, including a unified EU classification system setting harmonized criteria to determine whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable, disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks, amendments to the Benchmark Regulation to create a new category of benchmarks comprising low-carbon and positive carbon impact benchmarks, and amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) to provide consistency and clarity for institutional investors integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment decision-making process. Federated is assessing the potential impact that Sustainable Finance proposals may have on its non-U.S. business (including Hermes), results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
Investment management industry participants, such as Federated, also continued, and will continue, to monitor, plan for and implement certain changes in response to new proposed or adopted rules, such as the following, which Federated previously described in greater detail in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018:

• | On April 5, 2017, European Parliament passed EU money market fund reforms (Money Market Fund Regulation or MMFR). The MMFR provides for the following types of money market funds in the EU: (1) Government constant NAV (CNAV) funds; (2) Low volatility NAV (LVNAV) funds; (3) Short-term variable NAV (VNAV) funds; and (4) standard

13

VNAV funds. The reforms became effective (i.e., must be complied with) in regards to new funds on July 21, 2018 and became effective in regards to certain existing funds (including the Federated Funds in Ireland and the UK) on January 21, 2019. Federated utilized both internal and external resources to complete the conversion of two non-U.S. money market funds to LVNAV funds and two government non-U.S. money market funds to public debt CNAV funds, and otherwise began to comply with the MMFR, on January 11, 2019. Federated also continues to engage with trade associations and appropriate regulators in connection with the MMFR because the European Securities Market Authority and the European Commission continue work on implementing the MMFR and government CNAV and LVNAV fund reforms will be subject to a future review of their adequacy from a prudential and economic perspective by the European Commission in 2022. 

• | A European FTT also continues to be discussed without the FTT being adopted. Notwithstanding challenges to its legality, these discussions continue to involve, among other topics, the scope, application and allocation of the FTT, although any agreement on the FTT may be delayed until the Brexit negotiations are completed. Since the European Commission first proposed a European FTT in 2011, proponents of the FTT have sought the widest possible application of the FTT with low tax rates. On December 3, 2018, Germany and France discussed with other EU Member States, including Austria, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain, at a finance ministers' meeting in Brussels, a renewed proposal for a European FTT based on an existing French FTT on stock trades involving domestically issued shares by companies with a market capitalization over one billion euros. It has been reported that the Belgian Finance Minister indicated that the German-French initiative is a positive evolution in the discussions, and that the Austrian Finance Minister indicated that more information is needed to assess the proposal, that an FTT with the scope limited to domestically issued shares would not be a real FTT, and that the finance ministers will consider it as a possible alternative. This new German-French initiative is narrower than prior proposals for a European FTT, which involved a broader, more substantial FTT applicable to securities transactions, including derivatives. For example, prior proposals would have imposed a 0.1% tax on equity and bond trades and a 0.01% tax on derivative transactions. The exact time needed to reach resolution, implement any agreement and enact legislation is not known at this time. As noted above, Brexit could delay agreement on, and implementation of, the FTT in Europe. The Labour Party in the UK has also separately proposed a UK FTT, but with the Brexit uncertainty, it is uncertain whether a UK FTT will be advanced in 2019.


• | On July 4, 2018, the FCA released near final rules extending the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR) to insurers and all other firms offering financial services in the UK, intended to increase accountability for senior personnel and key staff. The FCA designates certain "senior management functions" and "certification functions." Under the SMCR, personnel conducting senior management functions (called Senior Managers) will need to be approved by the FCA and, those approved, will be listed in a Financial Services Register. Personnel that do not perform senior management functions but whose role could cause significant harm to customers or the firm are considered to perform certification functions (called Certification Staff). As such, firms are required to certify that such personnel are fit and proper to perform their roles. Both Senior Managers and Certification Staff must be identified and trained by December 9, 2019. Firms will have an additional twelve months to complete the certification process for Certification Staff. All staff (other than ancillary staff) will be subject to certain conduct rules set forth by the FCA.

The activities of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) also continue to be monitored by the investment management industry, including Federated. Building on consultations and other reports published in 2015 through 2018 regarding methodologies for identifying non-bank non-insurer global systemically important financial institutions, recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities, and liquidity risk management, the FSB and IOSCO continued, and will continue, to assess, and recommend and implement regulatory reforms affecting, money market funds, liquidity risk management, derivatives, leverage, and other aspects of the investment management industry. For example, in its 4th Annual Report published on November 28, 2018, among other topics, the FSB stated that it continues to monitor and assess the growth and risks in non-bank intermediation, including, for example, liquidity, digitalization of finance (or financial technology), crypto-assets, and artificial intelligence, and that it will continue to promote cross-border cooperation amongst regulators. In November of 2018, IOSCO published an update on its principles for the regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives markets and a consultation paper on leverage. In the consultation paper, IOSCO outlined a proposed framework that could be used by regulators to calculate and analyze leverage in investment funds, and requested comments by February 1, 2019.
The FCA and the Bank of England (BoE) Prudential Regulation Authority continue efforts started in September 2018 regarding the transition from LIBOR to the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) by the end of 2021. The BOE continues to encourage firms to consider their actions and preparations in managing the transition from LIBOR to alternative interest rate benchmarks, and to seek assurances that firms' senior managers and boards understand the risks associated with this transition. Regulators in the U.S. and other countries also are working on the transition from LIBOR. For example, the SEC and other regulators in the U.S. are undertaking efforts to identify risks and prepare for the transition from LIBOR to the Secured 
14

Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) by the end of 2021. The SOFR was selected as the preferred LIBOR replacement in the U.S. by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a December 6, 2018 speech, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton discussed the transition from LIBOR, noting that the SEC is working with other regulators to monitor risks and work needs to be done to develop a SOFR term structure that will facilitate the transition. The phase-out of LIBOR may cause the renegotiation or re-pricing of certain credit facilities, derivatives or other financial transactions to which investment management industry participants, including Federated and its products, customers or service providers, are parties, alter the accounting treatment of certain instruments or transactions, or have other unintended consequences, which, among other effects, could require additional internal and external resources to address these effects and increase operating expenses. 
Management believes that a UK FTT or EU FTT, particularly if enacted with broad application, would be detrimental to Federated's business and could adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Management continues to monitor and evaluate the post-implementation impact of European money market reforms on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Regulatory reforms stemming from Brexit or FCA, FSB, IOSCO or other initiatives or Regulatory Developments, as well as the potential political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit, also may adversely affect, potentially in a material way, Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Similar to Federated's efforts in the U.S., Federated has dedicated, and continues to dedicate, significant internal and external resources to analyze and address European reforms that impact Federated's fund business. European Regulatory Developments, and Federated's efforts relating thereto, have had, and may continue to have, an impact on Federated's expenses and, in turn, financial performance. As of December 31, 2018, Federated is unable to assess the potential impact that EU money market reforms, an FTT or other regulatory reforms or initiatives may have on its business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Federated also is unable to assess at this time whether, or the degree to which Federated, any of its investment management subsidiaries or any of the Federated Funds, including money market funds, or any of its other products, could ultimately be determined to be a non-bank, non-insurance company global systemically important financial institution. The Hermes Acquisition increases the potential impact that the above matters may have on Federated's business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, Federated employed 1,878 persons.
