ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 The disclosures set forth in this Item are qualified by the section captioned “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” contained in Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report.
 
Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc.
 
Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. is a one-bank holding company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in August 1991.  Mid Penn Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as “Mid Penn” or the “Corporation.”  On December 31, 1991, Mid Penn acquired, as part of the holding company formation, all of the outstanding common stock of Mid Penn Bank (the “Bank”), and the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mid Penn.  Mid Penn’s primary business is to supervise and coordinate the business of its Bank subsidiary and its divisions, and to provide them with capital and resources.
 
Mid Penn’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations consist almost entirely of that of the Bank, which is managed as a single business segment.  At December 31, 2018, Mid Penn had total consolidated assets of $2,077,981,000 with total deposits of $1,726,026,000 and total shareholders’ equity of $223,209,000.  Mid Penn currently does not own or lease any real property.  Mid Penn Bank owns or leases the banking offices as identified in Part I, Item 2.
 
All Mid Penn employees are employed by the Bank, with a shared services agreement to support the operation of the holding company.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had 372 full-time and 34 part-time employees.  The Bank and its employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the Bank believes it enjoys good relations with its personnel.
 
Mid Penn Insurance Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mid Penn Bank that provided a wide range of personal and commercial insurance products, ceased operations effective March 1, 2016 due to a lack of activity within this subsidiary.
 
Mid Penn Bank
 
Mid Penn Bank was organized in 1868 under a predecessor name, Millersburg Bank, and became a state chartered bank in 1931 and obtained trust powers in 1935, at which time its name was changed to Millersburg Trust Company.  In 1971, Millersburg Trust Company adopted the name “Mid Penn Bank”.  Mid Penn’s and the Bank’s legal headquarters are located at 349 Union Street, Millersburg, Pennsylvania 17061.  
 
On March 1, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of Phoenix Bancorp, Inc. (“Phoenix”) by Mid Penn, Phoenix’s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Miners Bank, was merged with and into the Bank.  The Bank was the surviving charter, and Miners Bank’s five branches in Schuylkill and Luzerne Counties, Pennsylvania operate as “Miners Bank, a Division of Mid Penn Bank”.  
 
On January 8, 2018, Mid Penn completed its acquisition of The Scottdale Bank and Trust Company (“Scottdale”) through the merger of Scottdale with and into Mid Penn Bank (the “Scottdale Merger”).  The Scottdale Merger resulted in the addition of five branches in Western Pennsylvania operating as “Scottdale Bank & Trust, a Division of Mid Penn Bank”.  
 
On July 31, 2018, Mid Penn completed its acquisition of First Priority Financial Corp. (“First Priority”) pursuant to which First Priority was merged with and into Mid Penn (the “First Priority Merger”), with Mid Penn being the surviving corporation in the First Priority Merger. As part of this acquisition, First Priority’s banking subsidiary, First Priority Bank, was merged with and into Mid Penn Bank.  The First Priority Merger resulted in the addition of eight offices in Southeastern Pennsylvania operating as “First Priority Bank, a Division of Mid Penn Bank”. 
 
Additional information related to the Scottdale and First Priority Mergers can be found in Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 
Also, in January 2018, Mid Penn opened a new full-service office in Halifax, PA, and in September 2018, opened a new full-service office in Pillow, PA.  After the opening of these two branches and adding thirteen from the two acquisitions that occurred during 2018, the Bank now has thirty-eight full service retail banking properties located in Berks, Bucks, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Fayette, Lancaster, Luzerne, Montgomery, Northumberland, Schuylkill and Westmoreland Counties within Pennsylvania.

MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
 
Mid Penn’s primary business consists of attracting deposits and loans from the Bank’s network of community banking offices.  The Bank engages in full-service commercial banking and trust business, making available to the community a wide range of financial services, including, but not limited to, mortgage and home equity loans, secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans, lines of credit, construction financing, farm loans, community development and local government loans and various types of time and demand deposits.  The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) supervise the Bank. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) to the maximum extent provided by law. In addition, the Bank provides a full range of trust and retail investment services.  The Bank also offers other services such as online banking, telephone banking, cash management services, automated teller services and safe deposit boxes.
Business Strategy
 
The Bank provides services to commercial businesses and real estate investors, consumers, nonprofit organizations, and municipalities through thirty-eight full service retail banking properties, one loan production office, a corporate administration office, and one operations facility which are all based in Pennsylvania.  Mid Penn’s primary markets reflect a diversified manufacturing and services base across twelve Pennsylvania counties, including having several offices in and around the state capital region of Harrisburg.  The Bank emphasizes developing long-term customer relationships, maintaining high quality service, and providing quick responses to customer needs.  Mid Penn believes that local relationship building and its conservative approach to lending are important factors in the success and growth of Mid Penn.
Lending Activities
 
The Bank offers a variety of loan products to its customers, including loans secured by real estate, and commercial and consumer loans.  The Bank’s primary lending objectives are as follows:

• | to establish relationships with creditworthy customers who exhibit positive historical repayment trends, stable cash flows and secondary sources of repayment from tangible collateral;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to establish a diversified loan portfolio; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | to provide a satisfactory return to Mid Penn’s shareholders by properly pricing loans to include the cost of funds, administrative costs, bad debts, local economic conditions, competition, customer relationships, the term of the loan, credit risk, collateral quality and a reasonable profit margin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Credit risk is managed through portfolio diversification, underwriting policies and procedures, and loan monitoring practices. Lenders are provided with detailed underwriting policies for all types of credit risks accepted by the Bank, and must obtain appropriate approvals for credit extensions.  The Bank also maintains strict documentation requirements and extensive credit quality assurance practices in order to identify credit portfolio weaknesses as early as possible so any exposures that are discovered might be mitigated or potential losses reduced. The Bank generally secures its loans with real estate with such collateral values dependent and subject to change based on real estate market conditions within its market area.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s highest concentration of credit is in commercial real estate.
 
Investment Activities
 
Mid Penn’s securities portfolio is a source for both liquidity and interest earnings, and serves to support pledging requirements on public funds deposits through investments in primarily higher-quality fixed-income debt securities.  Mid Penn does not have any significant non-governmental concentrations within its investment securities portfolio.
 
In addition to an available-for-sale portfolio, during the first quarter of 2017, Mid Penn established a held-to-maturity investment portfolio comprised primarily of lower-risk and lower-yielding U.S. Treasury notes, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, and investment-grade municipal securities. The held-to-maturity portfolio was established to support the Bank’s growth in public fund deposits which require pledging. The investments in the held-to-maturity portfolio are recorded on the balance sheet at book value (amortized cost), while the available-for-sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  Mid Penn’s available-for-sale investments include agency notes, agency mortgage-backed securities, and municipal securities.  These debt securities derive fair values relative to investments of the same type and credit profile with similar maturity dates.  As the interest rate environment changes, Mid Penn’s fair value of securities will change.  This difference between the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale investment securities, or unrealized loss, amounted to $4,103,000 as of December 31, 2018.  On an after-tax basis, this unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities resulted in a reduction to shareholders’ equity, through the accumulated other comprehensive loss component, of $3,242,000.  A majority of the investments are high quality United States and municipal securities that, if held to maturity, are expected to result in no realized loss to the Bank.

Deposits and Other Sources of Funds
 
The Bank primarily uses retail deposits and, to a lesser extent, wholesale borrowings to finance lending and investment activities.  Wholesale borrowing sources include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (the “FHLB”) and overnight borrowings from the Bank’s other correspondent banking relationships.  All borrowings, except for lines of credit with the Bank’s correspondent banks, require collateral in the form of loans or securities.  Collateral levels, therefore, limit the extent of borrowings and the available lines of credit extended by the Bank’s creditors.  As a result, generating and retaining retail deposits remains critical to the future funding and growth of the business.  Deposit growth within the banking industry has been subject to strong competition from a variety of financial services companies.  This competition may require financial institutions to adjust their product offerings and pricing to maintain and grow deposits. 
 
Additionally, the safety of traditional bank deposit products has remained an attractive option during periods of market volatility.  Mid Penn’s ability to attract retail funds in the future will continue to be impacted by the public’s appetite for the safety of insured or local investments versus the returns offered by alternative choices as part of their personal investment mix.
 
Competition
 
The banking business is highly competitive, and the profitability of Mid Penn depends principally upon the Bank’s ability to successfully compete in its market area.  The Bank actively competes with other financial services companies for deposit, loan, and trust business.  Competitors include other commercial banks, credit unions, savings banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, finance companies, mutual funds, and service alternatives via the Internet.  Financial institutions compete primarily on the quality of services rendered, interest rates on loans and deposits, service charges, the convenience of banking facilities, location and hours of operation and, in the case of loans to larger commercial borrowers, relative lending limits.
 
Many competitors are larger than the Bank and have significantly greater financial resources, personnel and locations from which to conduct business.  In addition, the Bank is subject to banking regulations while certain competitors may not be.  For more information, see the “Supervision and Regulation” section below and Item 1A., “Risk Factors”.
 
Mid Penn has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service, convenient hours, efficient and friendly employees, local decision making, and quality products.  
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 
Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws.  The regulation and supervision of Mid Penn and the Bank are primarily focused on the protection of depositors, the DIF, and the monetary system, and do not prioritize shareholder interests.  Enforcement actions that may be imposed by federal and state banking regulators include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, cease-and-desist orders and written agreements, the termination of insurance on deposits, the imposition of civil money penalties, and removal and prohibition orders.  If a banking regulator takes any enforcement action, the value of an equity investment in Mid Penn could be substantially reduced or eliminated.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was not subject to any supervisory enforcement actions.
 
Federal and state banking laws contain numerous provisions affecting various aspects of the business and operations of Mid Penn and the Bank.  Mid Penn is subject to, among others, the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Bank is subject to, among others, the regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and the FDIC.  The descriptions below of, and references to, applicable statutes and regulations are not intended to be complete lists or reflective of all applicable provisions or their effects on Mid Penn or the Bank.  They are summaries of the more significant laws and regulations and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete provisions of such statutes and regulations.
 
Holding Company Regulation
 
Mid Penn is a registered bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve.  As such, it is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”) and many of the Federal Reserve’s regulations promulgated thereunder.  The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies, including the power to impose substantial fines and civil penalties.
 
5

MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
 

The BHCA requires Mid Penn to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve regarding the holding company and its subsidiary bank.  The Federal Reserve Board also makes examinations of the holding company.  The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System; however, the Federal Reserve possesses cease-and-desist powers over bank holding companies and their subsidiaries where actions would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or violation of law.  The Federal Reserve Board also makes policy that applies to the declaration and distribution of dividends by bank holding companies.
 
The BHCA restricts a bank holding company’s ability to acquire control of additional banks.  In addition, the BHCA restricts the activities in which bank holding companies may engage directly or through non-bank subsidiaries.
 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act
 
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act (“GLB”), bank holding companies, such as Mid Penn, that meet certain management, capital, and Community Reinvestment Act standards, are permitted to become financial holding companies.  No prior regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in certain financial activities permitted under GLB. Activities cited by GLB as being financial in nature include:

• | securities underwriting, dealing and market making;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | insurance underwriting and agency;
--+-----------------------------------


• | merchant banking activities; and
--+---------------------------------


• | activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to permitting financial holding companies entry into new lines of business, the law allows companies the freedom to streamline existing operations and to potentially reduce costs.  The GLB may increase both opportunity and competition. 
 
A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the FDIC Improvement Act’s prompt corrective action provisions, is well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.  The required filing is a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company and meets all applicable requirements.  Many community banks are less able to devote the capital and management resources needed to facilitate broad expansion of financial services, such as insurance and brokerage services.  Mid Penn has not elected to become a financial holding company at this time.
 
Bank Regulation
 
The Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered institution, is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by both the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the FDIC.  The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law.  The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums, the amount of which depends in part on both the asset size and the condition of the Bank. Moreover, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance of the Bank under certain circumstances.  The federal and state banking regulatory agencies have broad enforcement powers over depository institutions under their jurisdiction, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a conservator or receiver if any of a number of conditions is met.  In addition, the Bank is subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws that affect its operations.
 
Banking regulations affect a wide range of the Bank’s activities and operations, including, but snot limited to, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans, compensation standards, payment of dividends, various bank account and bank service disclosures, and the safety and soundness of banking practices.
 
Capital Requirements
 
Under risk-based capital requirements for bank holding companies, Mid Penn is required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit) of eight percent. At least half of the total capital is to be composed of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill (“Tier 1 Capital”).  The remainder may consist of subordinated debt, non-qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance (“Tier 2 Capital”).  Combined, the Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital comprise regulatory “Total Capital”.  As of December 31, 2018, Mid Penn complied with these risk-based capital requirements.

MID PENN BANCORP, INC.
 
In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio requirements for bank holding companies.  These requirements provide for a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets (“leverage ratio”) equal to 3% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating.  All other bank holding companies will generally be required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4-5%.  The requirements also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets.  Furthermore, the requirements indicate that the Federal Reserve will continue to consider a “Tangible Tier 1 Leverage Ratio” (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity.  As of December 31, 2018, Mid Penn has met these leverage requirements, and the Federal Reserve has not advised Mid Penn of any specific minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement.
 
The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the FDIC, and as of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s capital levels were sufficient to be considered “well-capitalized”. The FDIC has not advised the Bank of any specific minimum leverage ratios.
 
The capital ratios of Mid Penn and the Bank are described in Note 19 to Mid Penn’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein.
 
Banking regulators may further refine capital requirements applicable to banking organizations, including those discussed in the “Regulatory Capital Changes” section below.  Changes to capital requirements could materially affect the profitability of Mid Penn or the fair value of Mid Penn stock.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 
In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, federal law establishes a system of “prompt corrective actions” which federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions which they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls.  Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution, which is not adequately capitalized.  Under the rules, an institution will be deemed to be “adequately capitalized” if it exceeds the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements.  However, it will be deemed “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0%, and “critically undercapitalized” if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
 
The prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party.  In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions including a prohibition on payment of dividends, a limitation on asset growth and expansion, in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain “management fees” to any “controlling person”. Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring, a limitation on the institution’s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business, obligations to raise additional capital, restrictions on transactions with affiliates, and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits.  In certain cases, bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors, or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser.  If an institution is deemed “critically undercapitalized” and continues in that category for four quarters, the statute requires, with certain limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership.

Regulatory Capital Changes
 
In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).  The final rules established a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer with a multi-year phase in to an eventual buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations.  If a banking organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the applicable capital conservation buffer for a given year, the bank could be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.  The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016 and were phased-in over a three-year period.  The final rules called for the following minimum capital requirements, including the capital conservation buffer, effective at both January 1, 2018 and 2019).

 | Effective January 1, | 
-----------------------------------------------------+----------------------+-----
 | 2018 | | 2019 
Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets | 6.375% | | 7.0% 
Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets | 7.875% | | 8.5% 
Total capital to risk-weighted assets | 9.875% | | 10.5%
Leverage ratio | | 4.0% | | 4.0%

 
The final rules also allowed community banks to make a one-time election not to include the additional components of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital.  Mid Penn made the election not to include the additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital.
 The final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010 for inclusion in the Tier 1 Capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 and banking organizations that were mutual holding companies as of May 19, 2010.
 Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the new rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures.  Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-ups approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250% risk weight.
 Under the new rules, mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”) and certain deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the former general risk-based capital rule.  The new rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain risk weights and credit conversion factors.
 Mid Penn and the Bank have complied throughout the phase-in period, and currently remain in compliance, with all the regulatory capital requirements.  Accordingly, the new rules did not have a material negative effect on Mid Penn’s financial condition or capital management activities for any period since the changes were implemented.
 Safety and Soundness Standards
 The federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards for depository institutions such as the Bank.  The guidelines establish general standards relating to management practices, internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, liquidity, capital, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.  In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.  The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder.  In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan.  If an institution is not satisfying certain safety and soundness standards and fails to submit to the banking regulatory agency an acceptable compliance plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the agency may issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions be taken, including restricting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid on deposits, restricting dividend payments to shareholders, and requiring an increase in the institution’s ratio of tangible equity to assets.  For the periods reported in this Form 10-K and in the period subsequent to December 31, 2018, up to the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, Mid Penn was not subject to any such bank regulatory orders.

Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions
 Mid Penn is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, the Bank.  There are various legal and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the Bank can, among other things, finance, or otherwise supply funds to, Mid Penn.  Specifically, dividends from the Bank are the principal source of Mid Penn’s cash funds, and there are certain legal restrictions under Pennsylvania law and Pennsylvania banking regulations on the payment of dividends by state-chartered banks.  The relevant regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit Mid Penn and the Bank from engaging in what, in the opinion of such regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound banking practice.  Depending upon the financial condition of Mid Penn and the Bank, the payment of dividends could be deemed by a regulatory agency to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice.  Mid Penn and the Bank were not subject to any such dividend prohibitions during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
Deposit Insurance
 The FDIC insures deposits of the Bank through the DIF. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium.  The amount each institution is assessed is based upon a variety of factors that include the level of assets and tangible equity, and the condition of the Bank (the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund).  The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000.  The Bank pays an insurance premium into the DIF based on a regulatory defined assessment calculation.  The FDIC uses a risk-based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the DIF.  The FDIC places each institution in one of four risk categories using a two-step process based first on capital ratios (the capital group assignment) and then on other relevant information (the supervisory group assignment).  Subsequently, the rate for each institution within a risk category may be adjusted depending upon different factors that either enhance or reduce the risk the institution poses to the DIF, including the unsecured debt, secured liabilities and brokered deposits related to each institution.  Finally, certain risk multipliers may be applied to the adjusted assessment.
 Beginning with the second quarter of 2011 and as applicable continuously through to the current period, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base that the FDIC uses to calculate assessment premiums is a bank’s average assets minus average tangible equity.   As the asset base of the banking industry is larger than the deposit base, the range of assessment rates is a low of 2.5 basis points and a high of 45 basis points, per $100 of assets.
 The FDIC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to establish assessment rates that will allow the DIF to achieve a reserve ratio of 1.35% of Insurance Fund insured deposits by September 2020.  In addition, the FDIC has established a “designated reserve ratio” of 2.0%, a target ratio that, until it is achieved, will not likely result in the FDIC reducing assessment rates.  In attempting to achieve the mandated 1.35% ratio, the FDIC is required to implement assessment formulas that charge banks over $10 billion in asset size more than banks under that size.  These new formulas did not affect the Bank as it was less than $10 billion in total assets size.  
 Consumer Protection Laws
 A number of laws govern the relationship between the Bank and its customers.  For example, the Community Reinvestment Act is designed to encourage services, investments, and lending activities in low and moderate income areas. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act attempt to minimize lending decisions based on impermissible criteria, such as race or gender. The Truth-in-Lending Act and the Truth-in-Savings Act require banks to provide certain disclosure of relevant terms related to loans and savings accounts, respectively.  Anti-tying restrictions (which prohibit conditioning the availability or terms of credit on the purchase of another banking product) further restrict the Bank’s relationships with its customers.  The Bank maintains a comprehensive compliance management program to promote its compliance with these and other applicable consumer protection laws and regulations.
Privacy Laws
 The federal banking regulators have issued a number of regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial and customer information.  The regulations limit the disclosure by financial institutions, such as Mid Penn and the Bank, of nonpublic personal information about individuals who obtain financial products or services for personal, family, or household purposes.  Subject to certain exceptions allowed by law, the regulations cover information sharing between financial institutions and nonaffiliated third parties.  More specifically, the regulations require financial institutions to provide:

• | initial notices to customers about their privacy policies, describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | annual notices of their privacy policies to their current customers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a reasonable method for consumers to “opt out” of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affiliate Transactions
 Transactions between Mid Penn and the Bank and its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An “affiliate” of a bank or savings institution is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank or savings institution.  Generally, a subsidiary of a depository institution that is not also a depository institution is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Sections 23A and 23B are intended to protect insured depository institutions from suffering losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates, by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
 The USA Patriot Act, Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing
 The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”) broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions, such as broker-dealers, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  Under Title III of the USA Patriot Act, also known as the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act of 2001, all financial institutions, including Mid Penn and the Bank, are required in general to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA Patriot Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state-chartered banks:
 
 
• | establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional information-sharing among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities is encouraged for financial institutions that comply with this provision and the authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt rules to further encourage cooperation and information-sharing.  
 The USA Patriot Act also expanded the conditions under which funds in a U.S. interbank account may be subject to forfeiture and increased the penalties for violation of anti-money laundering regulations.  Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.  The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money-laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act, which applies to the Bank.
 The Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act under the existing regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the USA Patriot Act and implementing regulations.
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 
On December 22, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), a tax reform law that included a significant provision reducing the corporate tax rate applicable to Mid Penn, for tax years beginning after 2017, to a flat 21 percent rate.  The reduction resulted in a one-time $1,169,000 write-down of Mid Penn’s deferred tax asset in December 2017, because the deferred tax asset was previously valued based upon the projection of Mid Penn realizing a 34 percent future corporate tax rate benefit.  This write-down was included in Mid Penn’s income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017, as further discussed in Note 18 (Federal Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Other significant provisions of the TCJA include (i) for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, the corporate AMT is repealed, and (ii) for property placed in service in tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017, the maximum amount Mid Penn may expense under Internal Revenue Code Sec. 179 is increased to $1 million, and the deduction phase-out threshold amount for all qualifying purchases in a year is increased to $2.5 million (with these amounts being indexed for inflation beginning for tax years after 2018).

JOBS Act
 
In 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) became law.  The JOBS Act is aimed at facilitating capital raising by smaller companies, banks, and bank holding companies.  Certain changes implemented by the JOBS Act that impacted Mid Penn included (i) raising the threshold requiring registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") for banks and bank holdings companies from 500 to 2,000 holders of record, and (ii) raising the threshold for triggering deregistration under the Exchange Act for banks and bank holding companies from 300 to 1,200 holders of record.
 Dodd-Frank Act
 The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, significantly changed regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry.  Dodd-Frank created a Financial Services Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation, and centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws.  Dodd-Frank also permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000, established strengthened capital standards for banks, disallowed certain trust preferred securities from qualifying as Tier 1 Capital (subject to certain grandfather provisions for existing trust preferred securities), established new minimum mortgage underwriting standards, granted the Federal Reserve the power to regulate debit card interchange fees, and implemented corporate governance changes.
 Effects of Government Policy and Potential Changes in Regulation
 Changes in regulations applicable to Mid Penn or the Bank, or shifts in monetary or other government policies, could have a material effect on our business. Mid Penn’s and the Bank’s business is also affected by the state of the financial services industry in general.  As a result of legal, economic, and competitive changes, management believes that the Bank and the financial services industry will continue to experience an increased rate of change from both the opportunities and competitive challenges resulting from greater product and service offerings, technological advancements, and business combinations.
 From time to time, legislation is enacted that has the effect of increasing the compliance and operations requirements and the cost of doing business, changing the tax structure applicable to Mid Penn, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions.  Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in Congress, and before various bank regulatory agencies.  Mid Penn cannot predict the likelihood of any major changes or the impact such changes might have on Mid Penn and/or the Bank.  Congressional bills and other proposals could result in additional significant changes to the banking system, including but not limited to provisions for limitations on deposit insurance coverage, changing the timing and method financial institutions use to pay for deposit insurance, expanding the power of banks by removing the restrictions on bank underwriting activities, changing the regulation of bank derivatives activities, and allowing commercial enterprises to own banks.  As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, the Bank’s business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal legislation and regulations that may increase the costs of doing business or change Mid Penn’s and the Bank’s competitive landscape.  Whether any future legislation will be enacted or additional regulations will be adopted, and how they might impact Mid Penn, cannot be determined at this time.
 Mid Penn’s earnings are, and will be affected by, domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies.  The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the operating results of commercial banks because of the Federal Reserve’s power to implement national monetary policy to, among other things, promote employment, control inflation or combat recession.  The Federal Reserve has a major impact on the loan and deposit rates offered by the Bank and its competitors, and on the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits, through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to reasonably predict the nature, amount, frequency, and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
 Environmental Laws
 Management does not anticipate that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have any material effect on Mid Penn’s capital, expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.  However, environmentally-related hazards have become a source of high risk and liability for some financial institutions.

Additionally, the Pennsylvania Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act provides, among other things, protection to lenders from environmental liability and remediation costs under the environmental laws for releases and contamination caused by others.  A lender who engages in activities involved in the routine practices of commercial lending, including, but not limited to, the providing of financial services, holding of security interests, workout practices, foreclosure or the recovery of funds from the sale of property shall not be liable under the environmental acts or common law equivalents to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources or to any other person by virtue of the fact that the lender engages in such commercial lending practice.  A lender, however, will be liable if it, its employees or agents, directly cause an immediate release or directly exacerbate a release of regulated substance on or from the property, or knew and willfully compelled the borrower to commit an action which caused such release or to violate an environmental act.  The Pennsylvania Economic Development Agency, Fiduciary and Lender Environmental Liability Protection Act does not limit federal liability which still exists under certain circumstances.
Corporate Governance
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) and related regulations adopted by the SEC and NASDAQ addressed the following issues:  corporate governance, auditor independence and accounting standards, executive compensation, insider loans, whistleblower protection, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.  Mid Penn has established policies, procedures, and systems designed to promote compliance with these regulations. Section 404 of SOX requires publicly held companies to document, test and certify that their internal control systems over financial reporting are effective.  Effective for year-end financial reports beginning with December 31, 2017, Mid Penn is subject to the independent attestation requirement under Section 404 of the SOX.  The Bank remains subject to independent auditor attestation under FDIC regulation 363.3(b), which is a similar independent attestation requirement at the Bank level.
