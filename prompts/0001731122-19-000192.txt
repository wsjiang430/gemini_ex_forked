Description of Business
 
We are a development-stage company focusing on the acquisition, development and commercialization of autologous (using a patient’s own cells) cellular therapies for medical and aesthetic applications. On July 12, 2013, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RenovaCare Sciences Corp., completed the acquisition of our flagship CellMistTM System along with associated United States patent applications and two foreign patent applications, the first of which was filed on August 23, 2007 (DE 10 2007 040 252.1) and the second of which was filed on April 27, 2011 (DE 10 2011 100 450.9), both of which have been granted. One of the US patent applications was granted to us on November 29, 2016 (Patent No. US 9,505,000) and the other patent application was granted to us on April 4, 2017 (Patent No. US 9,610,430). Two additional patent applications are pending.
 
On or about April 11, 2017, we received from Avita Medical a Petition for Inter Partes Review purporting to challenge the validity of the claims in U.S. Patent No. 9,610,430 before the PTAB of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Upon consideration of the arguments and evidence set forth by us and Avita, on December 18, 2017, the PTAB rendered a Final Written Decision dismissing the Petition in its entirety and, accordingly, confirming all such claims. Avita Medical’s right to file an appeal expired on February 21, 2018.
 
In the case of U.S. patents, a typical utility patent term is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, if the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications, from the date on which the earliest such application was filed. Patents filed outside of the U.S. have a patent term typically running 20 years from the date of first filing, but which are determined by the law of the country in which they issue. Patent term may be affected by events such as maintenance (or annuity) fee payment, terminal or statutory disclaimer, post-grant proceedings, patent term adjustment, and/or patent term extension.
 
The development of our CellMistTM System is in the early stage and we anticipate that we will be required to expend significant time and resources to further develop our technology and determine whether a commercially viable product can be developed. Research and development of new technologies involves a high degree of risk and there is no assurance that our development activities will result in a commercially viable product. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our development programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.
 
The average adult human has a skin surface area of between 16 - 21 square feet, which protects all other organs against the external environment. When a person’s skin is assailed by trauma or exposed to extreme heat, the skin’s various layers may be destroyed and depending on the severity of the injury, might cause life-threatening conditions. Currently, severe trauma to the skin, such as second or third degree burns, requires surgical mesh-grafting of skin, whereby healthy skin is removed from one area of the patient’s body (a “donor site”) and implanted on the damaged area. 
   2



While mesh grafting is often the method of choice, there are significant deficiencies with this method. The surgical procedure to remove healthy skin from the donor site can be painful and leaves the patient with a new wound that must also be attended to. In many instances the aesthetic results are not satisfying, as the color of the skin from the donor site may not match the skin color of the damaged skin. Additionally, the size of the donor skin removed must be substantially equal in size to the damaged skin area. These donor and injury sites can take weeks to heal, requiring expensive hospital stays, ongoing wound dressing management, and in some cases, complex anti-infection strategies.
 
We are currently evaluating the potential of our CellMistTM System in the treatment of tissue that has been subject to severe trauma such as second degree burns. The CellMistTM System utilizes the patient’s own skin stem cells, reduces the size of the donor site, and has shown to significantly decrease scarring. Furthermore, we believe the CellMistTM System could enable treatment of other skin disorders with minimal scarring. 
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
According to medical market research firm, Kalorama Information, the global market for wound care products is projected to grow to approximately $18.3 billion by 2019.
 
Burn Wounds
 
Burns are one of the most common and devastating forms of trauma. Patients with serious thermal injury require immediate specialized care in order to minimize morbidity and mortality. Data from the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in the U.S. show that approximately 2 million fires are reported each year which result in 1.2 million people with burn injuries (see American Burn Association Burn Incidence and Treatment in the US: 2000 Fact Sheet, available at: http://www.ameriburn.org). Moderate to severe burn injuries requiring hospitalization account for approximately 100,000 of these cases, and about 5,000 patients die each year from burn-related complications (see Church D, Elsayed S, Reid O, Winston B, Lindsay R “Burn wound infections” Clinical Microbiology Reviews 2006;19(2):403–34, available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1471990).
 
The prevalence of patients with severe burns is even higher in emerging economies. For example, according to the World Health Organization over 1,000,000 people in India are moderately to severely burnt every year and approximately 265,000 people worldwide die from burn related injuries (see World Health Organization “Burns: Fact Sheet No. 365,” reviewed September 2016, available at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs365/en/). According to Critical Care, an international clinical medical journal, burns are also among the most expensive traumatic injuries because of long and costly hospitalization, rehabilitation and wound and scar treatment (see Brusselaers, N., Monstrey, et al, “Severe Burn Injury in Europe: A systematic Review of the Incidence, Etiology, Morbidity, and Mortality” available at: http://ccforum.com/content/14/5/R188).
 
Burn injuries account for a significant cost to the health care system in North America and worldwide. In the U.S. there are currently 127 centers specializing in burn care. Recent estimates in the U.S. show that 40,000 patients are admitted annually for treatment with burn injuries, over 60% of the estimated U.S. acute hospitalizations related to burn injury were admitted to burn centers. Such centers now average over 200 annual admissions for burn injury and skin disorders requiring similar treatment. The other 4,500 U.S. acute care hospitals average less than 3 burn admissions per year (see American Burn Association Burn Incidence and Treatment in the US: 2013 Fact Sheet, available at: http://www.ameriburn.org).
 
Initial hospitalization costs and physicians' fees for specialized care of a patient with a major burn injury are currently estimated to be $200,000. Overall, costs escalate for major burn cases because of repeated admissions for reconstruction and rehabilitation therapy. In the U.S., current annual estimates show that more than $18 billion is spent on specialized care of patients with major burn injuries (see Church D, Elsayed S, Reid O, Winston B, Lindsay R “Burn wound infections” Clinical Microbiology Reviews 2006;19(2):403–34, available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1471990).

Most burn injuries involve layers of the upper skin, the epidermis. Severe major trauma involves a complete loss of the entire thickness of the skin and often requires major surgery involving split-skin mesh-grafting. Skin grafting is a procedure where healthy skin is removed from one area of the body and transplanted to a wound site.
 
Our Technology
 
Our cell isolation methodology is referred to as the CellMistTM process, and our cell deposition device is referred to as the SkinGunTM. We isolate a patient's stem cells from a small biopsy of the patient's skin. The stem cells are placed into a liquid solution, which is then filled into a sterile syringe. The syringe is inserted into the SkinGunTM, which then sprays the stem cell-loaded liquid solution into the wound.
 
The first phase of gathering the patient's stem cells, creating a liquid solution, and applying the stem cells takes approximately 1.5–2 hours. Within two weeks following the wound treatment procedure, the skin cells fully generate a normal upper skin layer (re-epithelialization), and within months the skin regains its color and texture.
 
Our cell isolation procedure and the cell spraying are performed on the same day, in an on-site setting. Because the skin cells sprayed using the SkinGunTM are actually the patient's own cells, the skin that is regenerated looks more natural than artificial skin replacements. During recovery, the skin cells grow into fully functional layers of the skin and the regenerated skin leaves minimal scarring. Additionally, our methods require substantially smaller donor areas than skin grafting, reducing donor area burden such as pain and the risk of complications.
 
The CellMistTM System remains an experimental, unproven methodology and we continue to evaluate its efficacy. There is no guarantee that we will able to develop a commercially viable product based upon the CellMistTM System and its underlying technology.
 
Domestic Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products or devices such as those we are attempting to develop. Our device candidates, to the extent they are developed, will be subject to pre-market approval by the FDA prior to their marketing for commercial use in the U.S., and to any approvals required by foreign governmental entities prior to their marketing outside the U.S. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require the submission of a new application in the U.S. for pre-market approval, or for foreign regulatory approvals outside the U.S.. The process of obtaining foreign approvals, can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain.
Premarket Approval
 
We will be required to file for premarket approval (“PMA”) for the SkinGunTMor any other device that we commercialize if it is deemed a Class III medical device. PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA has determined that general and special controls alone are insufficient to assure the safety and effectiveness of class III devices. Therefore, these devices require a PMA application under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in order to obtain marketing clearance.
 
PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. The applicant must receive FDA approval of its PMA application prior to marketing the device. PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). An approved PMA is, in effect, a private license granting the applicant (or owner) permission to market the device.

Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”)
 
Among the data required in a PMA application is human clinical test data. The FDA’s regulation that governs the human testing is the IDE and other patient protection regulations. For devices that are considered Significant Risk, an IDE application is required. It consists of the proposed clinical protocol and all supporting study documentation and must be submitted and approved by FDA and an Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to initiation of the human testing. Since the CellMistTM System employs the use of stem cells taken from the patient, it is considered Significant Risk by the FDA; therefore, we will be required to file an IDE application prior to conducting a clinical study for any application, such as for treatment of severe burns. The FDA has a specified review timeline and process for IDE reviews - each review phase takes 30 days and if the FDA has questions or concerns about the study design, there may be multiple review rounds until FDA either: (a) conditionally approves, (b) approves or (c) denies approval of the clinical study conduct under the submitted IDE. There is no guarantee that any IDE application we submit will be approved by the FDA.
 
HIPAA Requirements
 
Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with any research activities we conduct. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In relevant part, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to such health information. The first rule imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information. These standards restrict the manner and circumstances under which covered entities may use and disclose protected health information so as to protect the privacy of that information. The second rule released by HHS establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information. While we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA, the HIPAA standards impose requirements on covered entities conducting research activities regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected in the course of conducting the research.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.
International Regulation
 
The regulation of any potential product candidates we may produce outside of the U.S. varies by country. Certain countries regulate human tissue products as a biological product, which would require us to make extensive filings and obtain regulatory approvals before selling our product candidates. Certain other countries may classify our product candidates as human tissue for transplantation but may restrict its import or sale. Other countries have no application regulations regarding the import or sale of products similar to potential product candidates, creating uncertainty as to what standards we may be required to meet.

Competition
 
The biotechnology, medical device, and wound care industries are characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Our CellMistTM System competes with a variety of companies in the wound care markets, many of which offer substantially different treatments for similar problems. Currently Avita Medical Limited is evaluating the efficacy of ReCell, a cell spray device and a cell isolation procedure for autologous cells. Integra Lifesciences Holding Corp. sells Integra Dermal Regeneration Template, which does not use autologous cells, but instead uses an animal-derived intercellular matrix with an artificial waterproof barrier. Other competitors include: MiMedx Group, Inc.; Kinetic Concepts Inc.; Fibrocell Science, Inc.; Shire Plc and Organogenesis, Inc.
 
Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than those available to us. Additionally, many of our present and potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines. Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions addressed by our products, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our competitors.
 
Intellectual Property
 
General
 
In the course of conducting our business, we from time to time create inventions. Obtaining, maintaining and protecting our inventions, including seeking patent protection, might be important depending on the nature of the invention. To that end, we seek to implement patent and other intellectual property strategies to appropriately protect our intellectual property. While we file and prosecute patent applications to protect our inventions, our pending patent applications might not result in the issuance of patents or issued patents might not provide competitive advantages. Also, our patent protection might not prevent others from developing competitive products using related or other technology.
 
The scope, enforceability and effective term of issued patents can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions. Moreover, the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a patent with similar claim scope in another country, and claim interpretation and infringement laws vary among countries, so we are unable to predict the extent of patent protection in any country. The patents we obtain and the unpatented proprietary technology we hold might not afford us significant commercial protection or advantage.
 
In addition to issued patents describe above, we plan to file additional patent applications that, if issued, would provide further protection for The CellMistTM System. Although we believe the bases for these patents and patent applications are sound, they are untested; and there is no assurance that they will not be successfully challenged. There can be no assurance that any patent previously issued will be of commercial value, that any patent applications will result in issued patents of commercial value, or that our technology will not be held to infringe patents held by others.
 
Strategy
 
Our ultimate goal is to leverage the potential of our CellMistTM System, together with our cell isolation method, as cutting edge treatments in skin therapy. Before we can do so, however, there are a number of steps we must first take, including:

• | initiating a series of clinical trials to determine the CellMistTM System’s safety and efficacy for treating wounds and burns; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | formalizing collaborations with universities and scientific partners; 
• | creating a network of clinical and research partners; 
• | achieving FDA and other regulatory clearance; and 
• | expanding the range of possible applications.

Additionally, we will likely be continue to raise significant capital in order to fund our ongoing research and development operations, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
Operations
 
We expect to be engaged in research and development activities for the foreseeable future.
 
Employees
 
We currently have one full time employee, Mr. Andrew Danielson, Director of Operations, and two consultants, one of whom provides service as officers: Ms. Patsy Trisler, Vice-President Clinical & Regulatory Affairs; and Dr. Roger Esteban-Vives, Director of Cell Sciences. From time to time we use additional independent contractors to provide us with services. None of the consultants are required to expend all of their time and efforts on our behalf and may engage in other activities.
