BUSINESS
Business Overview
For over 55 years, we have been a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of safety and survivability equipment for first responders. Our equipment provides critical protection which allows its users to safely perform their duties and protect those around them in hazardous or life-threatening situations. Through our dedication to superior quality, we establish a direct covenant with end users that our products will perform and keep them safe when they are most needed. We sell a wide range of products including body armor, explosive ordnance disposal equipment and duty gear through both direct and indirect channels. In addition, through our owned distribution, we serve as a one-stop shop for first responders providing equipment we manufacture as well as third-party products including uniforms, optics, boots, firearms and ammunition. The majority of our diversified product offering is governed by rigorous safety standards and regulations. Demand for our products is driven by technological advancement as well as recurring modernization and replacement cycles for the equipment to maintain its efficiency, effective performance and regulatory compliance.
As discussed below, we believe we have established leading market positions in our major product categories through high-quality standards, innovation and a direct connection to the end users, including being a leading provider of explosive ordnance disposal technician equipment globally as well as a leading provider of safety holsters and a top provider of soft body armor for first responders in the U.S. We service the ever-changing needs of our end users by investing in research and development for new product innovation and technical advancements that continually raise the standards for safety and survivability equipment in the first responder market. Our target end user base includes domestic and international first responders such as state and local law enforcement, fire and rescue, explosive ordnance disposal technicians, emergency medical technicians (“EMT”), fishing and wildlife enforcement and departments of corrections, as well as federal agencies including the U.S. Department of State (“DoS”), U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”), U.S. Department of Interior (“DoI”), U.S. Department of Justice (“DoJ”), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), U.S. Department of Corrections (“DoC”) and numerous foreign government agencies. We have a large and diverse customer base, with no individual customer representing more than 10% of our total revenue.
We are committed to honoring those who put their lives in danger through the SAVES CLUB®, which pays homage to first responders who experience a life-threatening incident in the line of work in which our armor or duty gear contribute to saving their lives. The SAVES CLUB® currently has over 2,000 members and counting. With the help of our suppliers, distributors and first responder end users, we strive to fulfill the Company creed: Together, We Save Lives.
Industry Overview
The market for safety and survivability equipment serving first responders focuses on providing a diverse set of protective and mission enhancing products and solutions to our target end users. The market is driven by multiple factors including customer refresh cycles, growing number of personnel employed by first responder organizations, equipment replacement and modernization trends, greater emphasis on public and first responders’ safety and demographic shifts.
Body armor, explosive ordnance disposal equipment and duty gear comprise the core product areas in the safety and survivability equipment market and law enforcement personnel growth is a significant driver for our business. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the number of law enforcement personnel in the U.S. to increase at a faster rate than broader labor market growth over the 10-year period from 2019 to 2029, or 5%, from 813,500 in 2019 to 854,200 in 2029. Demand for first responder safety and survivability equipment is also fueled by increasing law enforcement budgets. 
In addition to the macro industry trends, each of these product segments experience unique drivers in and of themselves. Increasing mandatory body armor use and refresh policies, evolving technical standards and increases in tactical or special weapons and tactics (“SWAT”) law enforcement personnel act as tailwinds to the body armor market. Meanwhile, the explosive ordnance disposal equipment market is driven by the continued emergence of new global threats while duty gear is driven mainly by product use and replacement cycles.

Our management estimates the annual addressable market for soft body armor (including tactical soft armor) to be approximately $870 million. We also estimate explosive ordnance disposal equipment to have an addressable market of approximately $245 million over the seven-to-ten year life cycle of the products’ installed base. Finally, the annual addressable market for holsters for the global law enforcement and military and consumer markets is estimated to be approximately $380 million.
The international market is also poised for growth as foreign governments face increasingly complex safety challenges and seek to replace legacy equipment. Additionally, we foresee the demand for safety and survivability equipment from overseas markets to increase due to heightened awareness of the importance and effectiveness of such products and as countries are exposed to new threats. Our management estimates our addressable number of total law enforcement personnel outside the U.S. to be approximately 9.7 million, representing a substantial market opportunity.
Our management team believes that the safety and survivability equipment industry for first responders represents a stable and growing market with long-term opportunities. Given our strong market standing, direct connection to the end users, extensive distribution network, long history of innovations and high-quality standards, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the positive market dynamics.

expand our product and technology offerings, enter new markets and expand geographically to achieve attractive returns in our invested capital period.
We maintain a robust pipeline of opportunistic M&A opportunities, spanning our existing core products and markets as well as attractive adjacencies within the safety and survivability landscape. We plan to utilize our relatively high free-cash-flow generation and historical success in acquisitions to drive favorable acquisition structures and efficient integration. Our operating model, passion around connecting with customers and expansive channel help maximize the value created from our acquisitions.
Continuous Margin Improvement Initiatives. Our management team has shown a strong track record of achieving cost structure optimization to drive operating leverage, as evidenced by past years’ margin improvements. Our operating model starts with complexity reduction then uses lean tools and methods to continuously improve operational and commercial processes. Strategic initiatives completed over the past few years include among others, rationalizing the Company’s manufacturing footprint, divesting non-core activities, enhancing our supply chain and optimizing customer relationships and key contracts. Together these activities have helped enhance the Company’s manufacturing and sales operations, ultimately driving profitability growth.
Customers and Selling Channels
We sell our products through distributors and work directly with agencies to effectively reach end users. We classify our first responder customers into four categories: U.S. State and Local Agencies, International, U.S. Federal Agencies, and Commercial (which includes our direct-to-consumer sites). 
U.S. State and Local Agencies. We have built relationships with the majority of domestic law enforcement agencies in the country, selling at least one product category to each of the top 50 major departments. Other end users in this category include fire and rescue, explosive ordnance disposal technicians, EMT, fishing and wildlife enforcement and departments of corrections. We sell our products through a network of longstanding third-party distributors as well as an owned distribution platform, both of which interact directly with agencies and end users. 
International. Over the past three years, we have sold products to more than 100 countries globally. We service foreign defense ministries, foreign national law enforcement agencies and other foreign agencies through our distribution partners as well as through agency agreements with representatives to help service broad regions. 
U.S. Federal Agencies. We sell to a variety of federal agencies including the DoS, DoD, DoI, DoJ and DHS Inc. Furthermore, we have long-standing contracts with key departments within the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. 
Commercial. Our Commercial channel consists primarily of sales through largely recognized e-commerce companies and retailers as well as through our own e-commerce sites. 
We service each of our channels through in-field technical salespeople and an owned distribution network. Our traditional distribution network consists of longstanding distribution partners and agents for first responders and federal agencies, retailers and e-commerce platforms and our own website where we sell directly to the end user. We pair our in-house expertise with outside partners in order to provide our customers with the best service possible while maintaining a real-time understanding of end user needs. In total, we have 81 salespeople domestically and 21 internationally. We believe that by combining our third party network with our in-house salesforce and our extensive owned distribution network, we create continuous customer interaction and best- in-class service and training, providing us with a distinct advantage over our peers.
Our brand name recognition and reputation among our customers, diversified product line and extensive distribution network are central to our marketing strategy. We leverage these advantages along with involvement and support of several law enforcement associations to market our products.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
We operate a global manufacturing footprint with 16 sites across North America and Europe. Each site has capacity to scale up without further material investment in machinery and equipment. Additionally, we manage a diverse global supplier base of leading 

9



textile, fabric and raw material providers. We have multiple sources for each input in order to limit our dependency on any single vendor. No supplier makes up more than 10% of total purchases.
We are reliant on certain suppliers that provide us with the raw materials and components that we utilize in manufacturing our ballistic resistant garments. Although in some cases substitutable alternative materials and components may be obtained from other commercially available sources, any change in the materials and components that we utilize in manufacturing our ballistic resistant garments may require additional research and development, recertification as well as customer acceptance.
Competition
We compete in the large public safety and outdoor and recreation markets amongst other ancillary addressable markets. Competition in the public safety markets depends on the specific product in question but is generally based on a number of factors including product quality, safety performance, fit, price, and brand recognition. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully driven by the combination of our brand and product dependability, superior engineering and manufacturing capabilities, industry-leading product innovations, as well as on the breadth of our offering to customers.
Our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Point Blank Enterprises, Inc., Avon Protection Systems, Inc., Central Lake Armor Express, Inc. (d/b/a Armor Express), as well as the Blackhawk division of Vista Outdoor Inc. None of our competitors across individual product categories compete in each of our product verticals, making us the only one-stop provider of critical safety and survivability equipment solutions in the market.
Certain of our products cross over into the broader outdoor and recreation market, which is highly fragmented and highly competitive. While we believe that acceptance in this market is principally driven by the ability to bring new and innovative products to market, price point is critical.
Human Capital
We have a total of 2,274 employees. Of these employees, 1,729 were engaged in manufacturing, 221 in sales, marketing, product management and customer support, 152 in corporate functions (IT, Finance, HR, Legal and Compliance, etc.), 127 in R&D, technical engineering, manufacturing engineering and project management, 33 retail store associates and 12 in various executive and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. We believe that our employee relations are good. Our human capital objectives center around identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. 
Research and Development
Our significant IP portfolio combined with best-in-class product development and advanced materials processing separates us from our competitors. We have dedicated research and development centers at our manufacturing sites that specialize in product categories, including ballistics developments and state-of-the-art testing laboratory in Ontario, California, blast impact and technology development for explosive ordnances in Ottawa, Canada, and holster development and design in Jacksonville, FL, each of which focus on quality and product performance in order to generate critical real-time feedback. We aim to achieve efficient integration of quality materials and latest technologies to develop our products, which will allow us to leverage our first mover advantage from our suppliers.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We own significant intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, manufacturing processes and trade secrets related to our products, processes and business. Although our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position, we do not consider any single patent, trademark, manufacturing process or trade secret to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole.
We own a total of 447 patents and pending patent applications worldwide, of which 402 are patents granted and 45 are pending patent applications, with expiry dates ranging from 2023 to 2045 in 33 jurisdictions. Of those 447 patents and pending patent applications, 329 are for utility patents and 118 are for design patents. We own patents and pending patent applications in the United 

10



States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the People’s Republic of China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, as well as in the European Union.
The loss of patent protection for patents expiring in 2023 is not expected to have a material effect on our business.
Our material registered trademarks include SAFARILAND® and MED-ENG®.

Government Regulation
We are subject to federal licensing requirements with respect to the sale of some of our products in foreign countries. In addition, we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal, state and local regulations, both domestically and abroad, governing certain aspects of our operations and workplace.
The export of certain of our products from the U.S. is subject to various U.S. regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), and the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”). More specifically, to export some of our products in accordance with ITAR or EAR, we must obtain export authorizations or licenses from the U.S. government, primarily the U.S. Department of State for ITAR and the U.S. Department of Commerce for EAR. Also, the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (“AECA”) requires that a certification be provided to the U.S. Congress prior to the granting of any license or other approval for certain transactions involving exports of any defense articles and defense services and for exports of major defense equipment.
Our business in Canada is subject to the Canadian Controlled Good Directorate Registration regime, which regulates commerce in controlled goods, meaning those that require a license to export, including ITAR items.
We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) along with similar anti-corruption laws worldwide which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by U.S. and other business entities.
The transportation of certain of our products is subject to U.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Material Regulations (“HMR”), which govern the transportation of hazardous materials in interstate, intrastate, and foreign commerce. Prior to transportation into and within the United States, explosives must be tested and classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Domestically, the manufacture, sale, and purchase of certain products are subject to extensive federal, state, and local governmental regulation, with the primary regulatory body being the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, and Explosives (“ATF”). The primary federal laws are the National Firearms Act of 1934 (“NFA”), the Gun Control Act of 1968 (“GCA”) and the AECA. Among other things, the ATF conducts periodic audits of our facilities that hold Federal Firearms Licenses.

11



The Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) governs the majority of our contracts with U.S. federal agencies, mandating uniform policies and procedures across agencies and with each agency supplementing the FAR as needed. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“DFARS”). Finally, agencies routinely audit and review government contractors for performance and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards.
In addition, like many other manufacturers, we are subject to compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), data privacy laws, and many other regulations surrounding employment law, environmental law, taxation, and consumer protection.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; the restoration of damages to the environment; and health and safety matters. We have an excellent workplace safety track record and believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. We incur expenses in complying with environmental requirements and could incur higher costs in the future as a result of more stringent requirements that may be enacted in the future.
Impact of COVID-19
The global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S., and European governments in March 2020, with governments world-wide implementing safety measures restricting travel and requiring citizen lockdowns and self-confinements for quarantining purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, this had negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in significant transport restrictions and disruption of global financial markets.
An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have, a significant impact on the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on related activities causing disruption and delay, along with increased raw material, storage, and shipping costs. Any of these disruptions and delays may strain domestic and international supply chains, which could negatively affect the flow or availability of certain critical raw materials and finished good products that the Company relies upon. Furthermore, the foregoing impacts may negatively affect our logistical operations, including our fulfillment and shipping functions, which could result in periodic delays in the delivery of our products.
We expect that an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have, an impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these trends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors (some of which are outside management’s control), including those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
