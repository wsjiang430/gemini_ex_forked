ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General

Highwoods Properties, Inc., headquartered in Raleigh, is a publicly-traded real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company is a fully integrated office REIT that owns, develops, acquires, leases and manages properties primarily in the best business districts (BBDs) of Atlanta, Greensboro, Memphis, Nashville, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond and Tampa. Our Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "HIW." 
At December 31, 2018, the Company owned all of the Preferred Units and 103.1 million, or 97.4%, of the Common Units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners owned the remaining 2.7 million Common Units. Generally, the Operating Partnership is obligated to redeem each Common Unit at the request of the holder thereof for cash equal to the value of one share of Common Stock based on the average of the market price for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the notice date of such redemption, provided that the Company, at its option, may elect to acquire any such Common Units presented for redemption for cash or one share of Common Stock. The Common Units owned by the Company are not redeemable.

The Company was incorporated in Maryland in 1994. The Operating Partnership was formed in North Carolina in 1994. Our executive offices are located at 3100 Smoketree Court, Suite 600, Raleigh, NC 27604, and our telephone number is (919) 872-4924.

Our primary business is the operation, acquisition and development of office properties, which accounted for more than 97% of our annualized cash rental revenues as of December 31, 2018. There are no material inter-segment transactions. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the rental and other revenues, net operating income and assets for each reportable segment.

Business and Operating Strategy

Our Strategic Plan focuses on:


• | owning high-quality, differentiated office buildings in the BBDs of our core markets;


• | improving the operating results of our properties through concentrated leasing, asset management, cost control and customer service efforts;


• | developing and acquiring office buildings in BBDs that improve the overall quality of our portfolio and generate attractive returns over the long term for our stockholders;


• | disposing of properties no longer considered to be core assets primarily due to location, age, quality and/or overall strategic fit; and


• | maintaining a balance sheet with ample liquidity to meet our funding needs and growth prospects.

Local Market Leadership. We focus our real estate activities in markets where we have extensive local knowledge and own a significant amount of assets. In each of our core markets, we maintain offices that are led by division officers with significant real estate experience. Our real estate professionals are seasoned and have significant experience managing commercial real estate through all aspects of multiple economic cycles. Our senior leadership team has significant experience and maintains important relationships with market participants in each of our core markets.

Customer Service-Oriented Organization. We provide a complete line of real estate services to our customers. We believe that our in-house leasing and asset management, development, acquisition and construction management services generally allow us to respond to the many demands of our existing and potential customer base. We provide our customers with cost-effective services such as build-to-suit construction and space modification, including tenant improvements and expansions. In addition, the breadth of our capabilities and resources provides us with market information not generally available. We believe that operating efficiencies achieved through our fully integrated organization and the strength of our balance sheet also provide a competitive advantage in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers as well as setting our rental rates and pricing other services. In addition, our relationships with our customers may lead to development projects when these customers seek new space.

Geographic Diversification. Our core portfolio consists primarily of office properties in Raleigh, Atlanta, Tampa, Nashville, Memphis, Pittsburgh, Richmond and Orlando and office and industrial properties in Greensboro. We do not believe that our operations are significantly dependent upon any particular geographic market. 

Conservative and Flexible Balance Sheet. We are committed to maintaining a conservative and flexible balance sheet with access to ample liquidity, multiple sources of debt and equity capital and sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to fund our short and long-term liquidity requirements. Our balance sheet also allows us to proactively assure our existing and prospective customers that we are able to fund tenant improvements and maintain our properties in good condition while retaining the flexibility to capitalize on favorable development and acquisition opportunities as they arise.

Competition

Our properties compete for customers with similar properties located in our markets primarily on the basis of location, rent, services provided and the design, quality and condition of the facilities. We also compete with other domestic and foreign REITs, financial institutions, pension funds, partnerships, individual investors and others when attempting to acquire, develop and operate properties.
Sustainability
We are firmly committed to our intrinsic and societal responsibility to routinely minimize all environmental impacts resulting from our development and operation of our properties. We are devoted to creating healthy and productive workspaces for our customers and communities. More information regarding our sustainability strategy is available under the “Service Not Space/Sustainability” section of our website. Information on our website is not considered part of this Annual Report.
