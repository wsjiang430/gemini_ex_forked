GENERAL
 
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
 
Overview of the Company
 
Omega Flex, Inc. (Omega Flex) is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose, and is currently engaged in a number of different markets, including construction, manufacturing, transportation, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and other industries.
 
The Company’s business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories. The Company’s products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction, and general industrial markets, with a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property and patents issued in various countries around the world. The Company’s primary product, flexible gas piping, is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings. Through its flexibility and ease of use, the Company’s TracPipe® and TracPipe® CounterStrike® flexible gas piping, along with its fittings distributed under the trademarks AutoSnap® and AutoFlare®, allows users to substantially cut the time required to install gas piping, as compared to traditional methods. The Company’s products are primarily manufactured at its Exton, Pennsylvania facilities in the United States, and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom. A majority of the Company’s sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives, wholesalers and distributors, or a combination of both. The Company has a broad distribution network in North America and to a lesser extent in other global markets.
 
Industry Overview
 
The flexible metal hose industry is highly fragmented and diverse, with over 10 companies producing flexible metal hose in the United States, and at least that many in Europe and Asia. Because of its simple and ubiquitous nature, flexible metal hose can be applied and has been applied to a number of different applications across a broad range of industries.
 
The major market categories for flexible metallic hose include (1) automotive, (2) aerospace, (3) residential, commercial, and institutional construction, and (4) general industrial. Omega Flex participates in the latter two markets for flexible metallic hose. The residential and commercial construction markets utilize corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) primarily for flexible gas piping, double containment piping for conveying diesel fuel and gasoline from a storage tank to a dispenser or back-up generator. The Company utilizes corrugated copper tubing for medical gases in medical care facilities, including hospitals, clinics, dental and veterinary offices and long-term care facilities. The general industrial market includes all of the processing industries, the most important of which include primary steel, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and specialty applications for the transfer of fluids at both extremely low and high temperatures, (such as the conveying of cryogenic liquids) and a highly fragmented Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) market, as well as the maintenance and repair market.

None of our competitors appear to be dominant in more than one market. We are a leading supplier of flexible metal hose in each of the markets in which we participate. Our assessment of our overall competitive position is based on several factors. The flexible gas piping market in the U.S. is currently concentrated in the residential housing market. Based on the reports issued by the national trade groups on housing construction, the level of acceptance of flexible gas piping in the construction market, and the average usage of flexible gas piping in a residential building, we believe that we are able to estimate with a reasonable level of accuracy the size of the total gas piping market. In addition, the Company is a member of an industry trade group comprised of the largest manufacturers of CSST in the United States, which compiles and distributes sales volume statistics for its members relative to flexible gas piping. Based on our sales and the statistics described above, the Company believes it can estimate its position within that market. For other applications, industry trade groups collect and report data related to these markets, and we can then compare and estimate our status within that group as a whole. In addition, the customer base for the products that we sell, and the identity of the manufacturers aligned with those customers is fairly well known, which again allows the Company to extract information and estimate its market position. Lastly, the term “leading” implies a host of factors other than sales volume and market share position. It includes the range and capability of the product line, history of product development and new product launches, all of which information is in the public domain. Based on all of this information, the Company is reasonably confident that it is indeed a leader in the major market segments in which it participates.
 
Development of Business
 
Incorporated in 1975 under the name of Tofle America, Inc., the Company was originally established as the subsidiary of a Japanese manufacturer of flexible metal hose. For a number of years, we were a manufacturer of flexible metal hose that was sold primarily to customers using the hose for incorporation into finished assemblies for industrial applications. We later changed our name to Omega Flex, Inc., and in 1996, we were acquired by Mestek, Inc. (Mestek).
 
In January 2005, Mestek announced its intention to distribute its equity ownership in our common stock to the Mestek shareholders. A registration statement for the Omega Flex common stock was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the registration statement was declared effective on July 22, 2005. We also listed our common stock on the NASDAQ National Market (now the NASDAQ Global Market) under the stock symbol “OFLX”, and began public trading of our common stock on August 1, 2005. All Mestek shareholders as of the record date for the distribution received one share of Omega Flex common stock for each share of Mestek common stock owned as of the record date. We are now a totally separate company from Mestek, and we do not use or share any material assets or services of Mestek in conducting our business.
 
Over the years, most of the Company’s business has been generated from Omega Flex, Inc., and concentrated in North America, but the Company also has two foreign subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, which are largely focused on European and other international markets. The Company also has a local subsidiary which owns the Company’s Exton, Pennsylvania real estate.
 
Overview of Current Business
 
Products
 
The Company’s business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories.
 
The Company has had the most success within the residential construction industry with its flexible gas piping products, TracPipe®, which was introduced in 1997, and its more robust counterpart TracPipe® CounterStrike®, which came to market in 2004. Partnered with the development of our AutoFlare® and AutoSnap® patented fittings and accessories, both have enjoyed wide acceptance due to their reliability and durability. Within the residential construction industry, the flexible gas piping products that we offer and similar products offered by our competitors have sought to overcome the use of black iron pipe that has traditionally been used by the construction industry in the United States and Canada for the piping of fuel gases within a building. Prior to the introduction of the first CSST system in 1989, nearly all construction in the United States and Canada used traditional black iron pipe for gas piping. However, the advantages of CSST in areas subject to high incidence and likelihood of seismic events had been first demonstrated in Japan. In seismic testing, the CSST was shown to withstand the stresses on a piping system created by the shifting and movement of an earthquake better than rigid pipe. The advantages of CSST over the traditional black iron pipe also include lower overall installation costs because it can be installed in long uninterrupted lines within the building.

The flexibility of the tube allows it to be bent by hand without any tools when a change in direction in the line is required. In contrast, black iron pipe requires that each bend in the pipe have a separate fitting attached. This requires the installer to thread the ends of the black iron pipe, apply an adhesive to the threads, and then screw on the fitting, all of which is labor intensive and costly, including testing and rework if the work is not done properly. As a result of these advantages, the Company estimates that CSST now commands slightly over one-half of the market for fuel gas piping in new and remodeled residential construction in the United States, and the use of rigid iron pipe, and to a lesser degree copper tubing, accounts for the remainder of the market. The Company plans to continue its growth trend by demonstrating its advantages against other technologies, in both the residential and commercial markets, in both the United States and overseas in geographic areas that have access to natural gas distribution systems.
 
In 2004, we introduced a new brand of flexible gas piping sold under the registered trademark “CounterStrike®”. CounterStrike® is designed to be more resistant to damage from transient electrical arcing. This feature is particularly desirable in areas that are subject to high levels of lightning strikes, such as the Southeast and Ohio Valley sections of the United States. In a lightning strike, the electrical energy of the lightning can energize all metal systems and components in a building. This electrical energy, in attempting to reach ground, may arc between metal systems that have different electrical resistance, and arcing can cause damage to the metal systems. In standard CSST systems, an electrical bond between the CSST and the building’s grounding electrode would address this issue, but lightning is an extremely powerful and unpredictable force. CounterStrike® CSST is designed to be electrically conductive and therefore disperse the energy of any electrical charge over the entire surface of the CounterStrike® line. In 2007, we introduced a new version of CounterStrike® CSST that was tested to be even more resistant to damage from electrical arcing than the original version, and substantially more effective than standard CSST products. As a result of its robust performance, the new version of CounterStrike® has been widely accepted in the market, and thus during 2011, the Company made the decision to sell exclusively CounterStrike® within the United States. This move demonstrated the Company’s commitment to innovation and safety, and further enhanced our leadership in the marketplace.
 
In 2008, the Company introduced its first double containment piping product – DoubleTrac®. DoubleTrac® double containment piping has earned stringent industry certifications for its ability to safely contain and convey automotive fuels. DoubleTrac® received certification from Underwriters Laboratory, the testing and approval agency, that our product is fully compliant with UL971A, which is the product standard in the United States for metallic underground fuel piping, as well as approvals from other relevant state agencies that have more stringent testing procedures for the product. Similar to our flexible gas piping, DoubleTrac® provides advantages over older rigid pipe technologies. DoubleTrac® is made and can be installed in long continuous runs, eliminating the need for manually assembling rigid pipe junctions at the end of a pipe or at a turn in direction. In addition, DoubleTrac® has superior performance in terms of its ability to safely convey fuel from the storage tank to the dispenser, primarily because DoubleTrac® is essentially a zero permeation piping system, far exceeding the most stringent government regulations. Originally designed for applications involving automotive fueling stations running from the storage tank to the fuel dispenser, the ability of DoubleTrac® to handle a variety of installation challenges has broadened its applications to include refueling at marinas, fuel lines for back-up generators, and corrosive liquids at waste treatment plants. In short, in applications where double containment piping is required to handle potentially contaminating fluids or corrosive fluids, DoubleTrac® is engineered to handle those demanding applications.

DEF-Trac®, a complementary product which is very similar to DoubleTrac®, was brought to the marketplace in 2011. DEF-Trac® piping is specifically engineered to handle the demanding requirements for diesel emissions fluid (DEF). Recent federal regulations require all diesel engines to use DEF to reduce the particulate contaminants from the diesel combustion process. However, DEF is highly corrosive and cannot be pre-mixed with the diesel fuel. This requires that new diesel trucks and automobiles must have separate tanks built into the vehicle so that the diesel emissions fluid can be injected into the catalytic converter after the point of combustion. Similarly, a large portion of fueling stations carrying diesel fuel are now also selling DEF through a separate dispenser. In addition to being highly corrosive, DEF also has a high freezing temperature, requiring a heat trace in the piping in applications in northern areas of the United States. DEF-Trac® flexible piping is uniquely suited to handle all of these challenges, as the stainless steel inner core is corrosion resistant, and DEF-Trac® also comes with options for heat trace that is extruded directly into the wall of the product. In summary, DEF-Trac® provides a complete solution to the demanding requirements of this unique application, as such, DEF-Trac® has been met with enormous acceptance from the industry that was searching for a solution to the new environmental requirement. The advantageous market position of DEF-Trac® has leveraged the penetration of DoubleTrac® into the broader market for automotive fueling applications.
 
In September 2013, the Company announced that it would be releasing a newly developed fitting, AutoSnap®, as part of its flexible gas piping product line. After successfully completing all required testing by independent testing agencies, as well as extensive field trials across the United States by trained TracPipe® CounterStrike® installers, AutoSnap® was officially introduced to the market in January 2014 to wide acceptance. With its patent-pending design, the product simplified the installation process, and addressed installer preferences for both speed and ease of installation.
 
In January 2018, the Company announced its new product launch for MediTrac® corrugated medical tubing (“CMT”). Developed for the healthcare industry, the product can be used in hospitals, ambulatory care centers, dental, physician and veterinary clinics, laboratories, and any facility that uses medical gas. Made from a copper alloy with an exterior fire-retardant jacket, corrugated MediTrac CMT is made and sold in long continuous-length rolls.This flexibility and long lengths allows the product to be installed in health care facilities much more easily and quickly than traditional medical grade rigid copper pipe, which comes in 20 foot long sections. The MediTrac CMT can be unrolled from a spool and installed in a medical facility in one long continuous length, and can be bent by hand when a change in direction is needed. The long lengths and ability to change direction easily eliminates labor that would otherwise be need to braze connections to connect straight sections of copper pipe or elbows or tees for changes in direction. Easy to assemble axial swaged brass fittings connect with all K, L and DWV medical tubing that is sized from ½” to 2” in diameter, and provides a leak-tight seal using ordinary hand tools. The patent-pending fitting also prevents tampering or disassembly through the use of a tamper-proof sleeve that is required by the Health Care Facilities Code (NFPA 99 – 2018 edition). The use of long continuous lengths and assembly of factory-made fittings eliminates most brazing work that is typically needed for installing traditional rigid copper pipe, increasing installation efficiency and operational safety. Rated for 185 psig, MediTrac® can deliver the necessary volume of gas wherever its needed across long distances of a large facility. A recent case study comparing the installation of rigid copper pipe and MediTrac® CMT showed that MediTrac® increases installation efficiency by a factor of five (i.e., a 500% increase in efficiency). Because the tubing is supplied cleaned and capped, MediTrac also reduces possible contamination into the medical gas system. MediTrac® hs additional benefits of eliminating the costs for installation materials like brazing rods and purge gases, easier transportation of rolls of pipe as compared to 20 foot long lengths of rigid copper pipe, and reduced fire risk from reduced number of brazed connections. MediTrac is currently listed to UL 1365 and has an ASTM E84 rating of 25/50, and meets all 2018 requirements of the Health Care Facilities Code (NFPA 99 – 2018). We have completed several beta sites 2018, and full commercialization will commence in 2019.
 
In addition to the flexible gas piping and other previously described markets, our flexible metal hose is used in a wide variety of other applications. Our involvement in these markets is important because just as the flexible gas piping applications have sprung from our expertise in manufacturing annular metal hose, other applications may also evolve from our participation in the industry. Flexible metal hose is used in a wide variety of industrial and processing applications where the characteristics of the flexible hose in terms of its flexibility, and its ability to absorb vibration and thermal expansion and contraction, have substantial benefits over rigid piping. For example, in certain pharmaceutical processing applications, the process of developing the specific pharmaceutical may require rapid freezing of various compounds through the use of liquefied gases, such as liquefied nitrogen, helium or Freon. The use of flexible metal tubing is particularly appropriate in these types of applications. Flexible metal hose can accommodate the thermal expansion caused by the liquefied gases carried through the hose, and the total length of the hose will not significantly vary. In contrast, fixed or rigid metal pipe would expand and contract along its length as the liquid gases passed through it, causing stresses on the pipe junctions that would over time cause fatigue and failure. Alternatively, within certain industrial or commercial applications using steam, either as a heat source or in the industrial process itself, the pumps used to transfer the liquid or steam within the system are subject to varying degrees of vibration. Additionally, flexible metal hoses can also be used as connections between the pump and the intake of the fluids being transferred to eliminate the vibration effects of the pumps on the piping transfer system. All of these areas provide opportunities for the flexible metal hose arena, and thus the Company continues to participate in these markets, as it seeks new innovative solutions which will generate additional revenue streams for the future.

Manufacturing
 
In each instance, whether the application is for CSST for fuel gases, flexible metal hose for handling specialty chemicals or gases, flexible double containment piping, unique industrial applications requiring the ability to withstand wide variations in temperature and vibration, or copper alloyed CMT for medical facilities, all of our success rests on our metal hose. Most of our flexible metal hoses range in diameter from 1/4” to 2” while certain applications require diameters of up to 16”. All of our smaller diameter pipe (2” inner diameter and smaller) is made by a proprietary process that is known as the rotary process. The proprietary process that we use to manufacture our annular hose is the result of a long-term development effort begun in 1995. Through continuous improvement over the years, we have developed and fine-tuned the process so that we can manufacture annular flexible metal hose on a high speed, continuous process. We believe that our own rotary process for manufacturing annular corrugated metal hose is the most cost efficient method in the industry, and that our rotary process provides us with a significant advantage in many of the industries in which we participate. As a result, we are able to provide our product on a demand basis. Over the years, the Company has had great success in achieving on-time delivery performance to the scheduled ship date. The quick inventory turnover reduces our costs for in-process inventory, and further contributes to our gross margin levels. We have also improved our productivity on a historical basis.
Raw Materials
 
We use various materials in the manufacture of our products, primarily stainless steel for our flexible metal hose and plastics for our jacketing material on TracPipe® CounterStrike® flexible gas piping and DoubleTrac® double containment piping, as well as a copper alloy for our MediTrac® CMT. We also purchase all of our proprietary fittings for use with the TracPipe® and CounterStrike® flexible gas piping, DoubleTrac® double containment piping, and MediTrac® CMT. Although we have multiple sources qualified for all of our major raw materials and components, we have historically used only one or two sources of supply for such raw materials and components. Our current orders for stainless steel and fittings are each placed with one or two suppliers. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, then we would have to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from our other qualified sources. This potential transition, if it were to occur, could affect our operations and financial results during the period of such transition. During 2018, the commodity prices of nickel increased compared to the prior year, while copper was reasonably flat. The Company experienced increases in most of its core components, as our vendors sought to recoup pricing and production burdens. Nickel is a prime material in stainless steel which the Company utilizes to manufacture CSST, and copper is a key component of the Company’s brass fittings and our MediTrac® CMT. Fortunately, the Company was able to maintain reasonably stable margins during 2018. This was accomplished by implementing our own pricing actions to help offset the upward movements in our material costs. The supply of our main raw materials appears to be sufficient with ample volume. We believe that with our purchase commitments for stainless steel, polyethylene and for our proprietary fittings, we have adequate sources of supply for these raw materials and components. We have not had difficulty in obtaining the raw materials, component parts or finished goods from our suppliers. We believe that the supply sufficiency of stainless steel will continue until there is a reduction in global capacity, such as mine closures, which would then cause a constriction. Volatility in the commodities marketplace and competitive conditions in the sale of our products could potentially restrict us from passing along raw materials or component part price increases to our customers.

Business Seasonality
 
The demand for our flexible piping products that are related to construction activity including TracPipe®, Counterstrike®, DoubleTrac® and MediTrac®, may be affected by the construction industry’s demand, which generally tightens during the winter months of each year due to cold and inclement weather. Accordingly, sales are usually higher in the spring, summer and fall.
Customers
 
We sell our products to customers scattered across a wide and diverse set of industries ranging from construction to pharmaceutical with over 9,000 customers on record. These sales channels include sales through independent sales representatives, distributors, original equipment manufacturers, direct sales, and sales through our website on the internet. We utilize various distribution companies in the sale of our TracPipe® and Counterstrike® flexible gas piping, and these distribution customers in the aggregate represent a significant portion of our business. In particular, the Company has one significant customer, Ferguson Enterprises, whose various branches had sales in the range of 13% to 15% of total sales during the period of 2016 to 2018, and was in the range of 19% to 22% of our accounts receivable balance over the last two years. All of this business is done on a purchase order basis for immediate resale commitments or stocking, and there are no long-term purchase commitments. In the event we were to lose an account, we would not expect any long-term reduction in our sales due to the broad end-user acceptance of our products. We would anticipate that in the event of a loss of any one or more distributors, that after an initial transition period, the sale of our products would resume at or near their historical levels. Furthermore, in the case of certain national distribution chains, which is the case regarding the Company’s largest customer noted above, and other distributors, it is possible that there would continue to be purchasing activity from one or more regional or branch distribution customers. We sell our products within North America, primarily in the United States and Canada, and we also sell our products internationally, primarily in Europe through our manufacturing facility located in Banbury, England. Our sales outside of North America were in the range of 10% to 11% of our total sales during the last three years, with most of the sales occurring in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. We do not have a material portion of our long-lived assets located outside of the United States.
Distribution of Sales
 
As mentioned previously, we sell our products primarily through independent outside sales organizations, including independent sales representatives, distributors, fabricating distributors, wholesalers, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We have a limited internal sales function that sells our products to key accounts, including OEMs and distributors of bulk hose. We believe that within each geographic market in which the independent sales representative, distributor or wholesaler is located that our outside sales organizations are the first or second most successful outside sales organization for the particular product line within that geographic area.
Competition
 
There are approximately ten manufacturers of flexible metal hose in the United States, and approximately that number in Europe and Asia. The U. S. manufacturers include Titeflex Corporation, Ward Manufacturing, Microflex, U. S. Hose, Hose Master and several smaller privately held companies. No one manufacturer, as a general rule, participates in more than two of the major market categories, automotive, aerospace, residential and commercial construction, and general industrial, with most concentrating in just one. We estimate that we are at or near the top position of the two major categories in which we participate in regards to market share. In the flexible gas piping market, the U.S. market is currently concentrated in the residential housing market. Based on the reports issued by the national trade groups on housing construction, the level of acceptance of flexible gas piping in the construction market, and the average usage of flexible gas piping in a residential building, as well as through our sales position within that market, we are able to estimate with a high level of accuracy the size of the total gas piping market. In addition, the Company is a member of an industry trade group, which compiles and distributes sales statistics for its members relative to flexible gas piping. For other applications, industry trade groups collect and report on the size of the relevant market, and we can estimate our percentage of the relevant market based on our sales as compared to the market as a whole. The larger of our two markets, the construction industry, has seen a modest increase in the number of residential housing starts in 2018, as compared to the previous year. As discussed elsewhere, black iron pipe or copper tubing was historically used by all builders of commercial and residential buildings until the advent of flexible gas piping and changes in the relevant building codes. Since that time, flexible gas piping has taken an increasing share of the total amount of fuel gas piping used in construction.

Due to the number of applications in which flexible metal hose may be used, and the number of companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose, the general industrial market is very fragmented, and we estimate that no one company has a predominant market share of the business over other competitors. In the market for double containment piping, we compete primarily against rigid pipe systems that are more costly to install than DoubleTrac® double containment piping. For medical tubing applications, the main competitor is medical grade (Type K or Type L) rigid copper pipe. MediTrac® is the only corrugated medical tubing in the United States that is approved to the stringent requirements of UL 1365. The general industrial markets within Europe are very mature and tend to offer opportunities that are interesting to us in niche markets or during periods in which a weak dollar increases the demand for our products on a competitive basis. Such has been the case for several years and has created new relationships for us. Currently, we are not heavily engaged in the manufacture of flexible metal hose for the aerospace or automotive markets, but we continue to review opportunities in all markets for our products to determine appropriate applications that will provide growth potential and high margins. In some cases, where the product offering is considered a commodity, price is the overriding competing factor. In other cases, a proprietary product offering or superior performance will be the major factors with pricing being secondary and in some cases, a non-factor. The majority of our sales are to distributors and wholesalers, and our relationships with these customers are on an arms-length basis in that neither we, nor the customers are so dependent on the other to yield any significant business advantage. From our perspective, we are able to maintain a steady demand for our products due to the broad acceptance of our products by end users, regardless of which distributor or wholesaler sells the product.
 
Backlog
 
Management does not believe that backlog figures are material to an understanding of our business because most products are shipped promptly after the receipt of orders.
Intellectual Property
 
We have a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property, including approximately 240 patents issued in various countries around the world. The patents cover (a) the fittings used by the flexible gas piping to join the piping to a junction or assembly, (b) pre-sleeved CSST for use in underground applications, (c) an electrically conductive jacket for flexible gas piping that we sell under the trademark CounterStrike®, and (d) a tubing containment system for our DoubleTrac® double containment piping and CMT fittings. In combination, our AutoFlare® and AutoSnap® fittings are the leading products used with flexible gas piping because they offer a metal-to-metal seal between the fitting and the tubing, and because of their robustness and ease of use. The metal-to-metal contact provides for a longer lasting and more reliable seal than fittings which use gaskets or sealing compounds that can deteriorate over time. In applications involving fuel gases in a building, the ability to maintain the seal and prevent the leaking of such gases over long periods of time is valued by our customers. In addition, the AutoSnap® fitting provides the installer with greater ease of use by preassembling all the securing elements inside the body of the fitting. We also have received a patent for the composition of the polyethylene jacket used in our CounterStrike® flexible gas piping product, which has increased ability to dissipate electrical energy in the event of a nearby lightning strike. The tubing containment system of our DoubleTrac® double containment piping, which is also patented in the U.S. and in other countries, allows for the monitoring and collection of any liquids that may leak from the stainless steel containment layer. We have filed patent applications for the MediTrac fittings to cover the unique requirements in the United States for fittings that permanently affix the fitting to the CMT system, and provides a tamper-proof connection to the CMT system. The expiration dates for the several patents covering our AutoFlare® fittings will be expiring through 2020 and the Counterstrike® patent will expire in 2025. We currently have several patent applications pending in the United States and internationally covering improvements to our AutoFlare® fittings and our CounterStrike® polyethylene jacket, and also have a patent pending on our new AutoSnap® fitting. Finally, and as mentioned above, our unique rotary process for manufacturing flexible metal hose has been developed over the last ten years, and constitutes a valuable trade secret. In 2007, a Pennsylvania court issued a ruling that confirms our proprietary rotary manufacturing process does constitute a “trade secret” under Pennsylvania law, and is entitled to protection against unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 151 employees. Most of our employees are located in our manufacturing facilities in Exton, Pennsylvania, which contain our factory personnel, engineering, finance, human resources and most of our sales staff. Our factory workforce in Exton, Pennsylvania, is not party to a collective bargaining agreement. A small amount of employees work at our facility in Houston, Texas. We also maintain an office in Middletown, Connecticut where certain management, sales and administrative personnel reside. A number of individual sales personnel are also scattered across the United States. We also maintain a manufacturing facility in Banbury, England, which contains employees of similar functions to those in the U.S., but on a much smaller scale. The sales personnel in England handle all sales and service for our products in Europe, most notably the United Kingdom, and the majority of our transactions with other international territories.
Environmental
 
Our manufacturing processes do not require the use of significant quantities of hazardous substances or materials, and therefore we are able to operate our Exton facility as a “small quantity generator” under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 321 et seq. As a result, compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws do not pose a material burden on our business, and we are not required to expend any material amounts on capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for our manufacturing facility.
