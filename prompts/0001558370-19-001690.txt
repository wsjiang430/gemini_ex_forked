 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a provider of professional technical and consulting services to utilities, private industry, and public agencies at all levels of government. We enable our clients to realize cost and energy savings by providing a wide range of specialized services.
 We seek to establish close working relationships with our clients and expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them over time.  We operate our business through a nationwide network of offices spread across 20 states and the District of Columbia. Our business with public and private utilities is concentrated primarily in California and New York, including 16 of the 25 largest electric utilities and five of the 10 largest municipal utilities in the United States. Our business with public agencies is concentrated in California, New York and Arizona. We also serve special districts, school districts, a range of public agencies and private industry.
 We operate within two segments for financial reporting purposes, Energy and Engineering and Consulting.
 Our Energy segment consists of the business of our subsidiary, Willdan Energy Solutions (“WES”), which offers energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services to utilities, public agencies and private industry under a variety of business names, including Willdan Lighting & Electric, Abacus Resource Management Company, 360 Energy Engineers, LLC, Genesys Engineering P.C., Integral Analytics, Inc., Newcomb Anderson McCormick, Inc. and Lime Energy. This segment is currently our largest segment based on contract revenue, representing approximately 72% and 73% of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect that consolidated contract revenue generated from our Energy segment as a percentage of our total consolidated contract revenue will continue to grow in fiscal year 2019 as a result of our acquisition of Lime Energy.
 Our Engineering and Consulting segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries, Willdan Engineering, Willdan Infrastructure, Public Agency Resources, Willdan Financial Services and Willdan Homeland Solutions. Willdan Engineering provides civil engineering‑related construction management, building and safety, city engineering, city planning, geotechnical, material testing and other engineering consulting services to our clients. Willdan Infrastructure provides engineering services to larger rail, port, water, mining and other civil engineering projects. Public Agency Resources primarily provides staffing to Willdan Engineering. Willdan Financial Services provides economic and financial consulting to public agencies. Willdan Homeland Solutions provides national preparedness and interoperability services and communications and technology solutions. Contract revenue for the Engineering and Consulting segment represented approximately 28% and 27% of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 We were founded in 1964 and Willdan Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2006 to serve as our holding company. Historically, our clients have been public agencies in communities with populations ranging from 10,000 to 300,000 people.  We believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects and private sector projects.  Since expanding into energy efficiency services, our client base has grown to include investor-owned and other public utilities as well as substantial energy users in government and business.
 Since December 31, 2014, we have successfully completed seven acquisitions:

· | On January 15, 2015, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary WES acquired all of the outstanding shares of Abacus Resource Management Company, an Oregon-based energy engineering company, and substantially all of the assets of 360 Energy Engineers, LLC, a Kansas-based energy engineering company.

--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Government funding programs and various state legislation that provide funds for local communities to provide services to their constituents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Energy Services
 In response to an increased awareness of global warming and climate change issues, private industry and public agencies are increasingly seeking out cost‑effective, turnkey solutions that provide innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation and sustainability services. State and local governments are frequently turning to specialized resource conservation firms to strike the balance between environmental responsibility and economic competitiveness. Our consultants have the expertise to develop efficient and cost effective solutions. The use of energy efficiency services, including audits, program design, benchmark analysis, metering and partnerships provides government agencies, utilities and private firms with the ability to realize long‑term savings. Engineering and Consulting Services
 Our Engineering and Consulting segment provides a variety of services to a diverse customer base, with a focus on providing our customers with design, construction oversight, advisory and training services. Many of our customers find it more efficient to outsource such services to service providers rather than maintain the necessary staff and resources to provide such services themselves. For example, we design and provide construction oversight of public infrastructure projects for federal, state and local governments who have increased their infrastructure-related funding as a result of population growth, increase in local and state funding and aging infrastructure. Relatedly, we provide consulting services to public agencies as they raise the necessary funds to develop such infrastructure projects and provide other services. We also advise public agencies on disaster and emergency preparedness which, as a result of terrorist attacks and natural and man-made disasters over the last two decades, have placed increased strain on state, regional and local agencies.

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Energy | 72 | % | 73 | % | 68 | %
Engineering and Consulting | 28 | % | 27 | % | 32 | %

  See Note 13 “—Segment Information” for additional segment information.
 Energy Services 
 We commenced providing energy services with the creation of our subsidiary, WES and its acquisition of Intergy Corporation in fiscal year 2008. Since then, we have grown our Energy segment through organic growth and through the acquisitions by WES of all of the capital stock or substantially all of the assets of Abacus Resource Management Company and 360 Energy Engineers, LLC in January 2015, Genesys Engineering, P.C. in March 2016, Integral Analytics, Inc. in July 2017, Newcomb Anderson McCormick, Inc. in April 2018 and Lime Energy in November 2018.
 Through WES and its subsidiaries, we provide specialized, innovative, comprehensive energy solutions to businesses, utilities, state agencies, municipalities, and non‑profit organizations in the U.S. Our experienced engineers, consultants and staff help our clients realize cost and energy savings by tailoring efficient and cost‑effective solutions to assist them in optimizing their energy spend. Our energy services include comprehensive surveys, program design, master planning, benchmarking analyses, design engineering, construction management, performance contracting, installation, alternative financing, and measurement and verification services.
 We believe that our recent acquisition of Lime Energy will further expand our presence in the energy services market and enhance our product offerings. The acquisition of Lime Energy provides us the opportunity to diversify our geographical presence, including in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States where we previously had limited operations. Lime Energy also expands our utility customer base, as Lime Energy delivers energy efficiency programs to some of the largest electric utilities that were not previously our clients. In addition, we believe that the acquisition of Lime Energy will better position us to take advantage of the anticipated upcoming expansions in energy efficiency budgets and contracts in California and the Northeastern United States.
 Our range of energy efficiency services are described below:
 Energy Efficiency. We provide complete energy efficiency consulting and engineering services, including: program design, management and administration; marketing, customer outreach, and project origination; energy audits and feasibility analyses; retro‑commissioning; implementation, training and management; data management and reporting; and measurement and verification services.

  Engineering and Consulting Services
 We provide a broad range of engineering and consulting services to the public sector and limited services to the private sector. In general, contracts for engineering and consulting services (as opposed to construction oversight contracts) are awarded by public agencies based primarily upon the qualifications of the engineering professional, rather than the proposed fees. We have longstanding relationships with many of these agencies and are recognized as having relevant expertise and customer focused services. A substantial percentage of our work is for existing clients that we have served for many years.
 Since 1999, our subsidiary Willdan Financial Services, a public finance consulting business, has supplemented the engineering services that we offer our clients. In general, we supply expertise and support for the various financing techniques employed by public agencies to finance their operations and infrastructure. We also support the mandated reporting and other requirements associated with these financings. We do not provide underwriting or financial advisory services for municipal securities. Further, our subsidiary Willdan Homeland Solutions provides emergency preparedness planning, emergency preparedness training and emergency preparedness exercises that focus on integrating local resources and assets within state and federal systems to cities, counties and related municipal service agencies, such as utility and water companies, as well as school districts, port and transportation authorities, tribal governments and large business enterprises with a need for homeland security related services.
 The following are examples of the services that we provide in the Engineering and Consulting segment:
 Building and Safety. Our building and safety services range from managing and staffing an entire municipal building department to providing specific outsourced services, such as plan review and field inspections. Other related services that we offer under this umbrella include performing accessibility compliance and providing disaster recovery teams, energy compliance evaluations, permit processing and issuance, seismic retrofitting programs, and structural plan review. Many of our building and safety services engagements are with municipalities and counties where we supplement the capacity of in‑house staff.
 City Engineering and Code Enforcement. We provide municipalities with city engineering services and assist municipalities with the development, implementation and enforcement of building and development codes. These

adjacent properties. We design open and closed storm drain systems and detention basin facilities, for cities, counties and the Army Corp of Engineers.
 District Administration. We administer special districts on behalf of public agencies. The types of special districts administered include community facilities districts (in California, Mello‑Roos districts), assessment districts, landscape and lighting districts, school facilities improvement districts, benefit assessment districts, fire suppression districts, and business improvement districts. Our district administration services include calculating the annual levy for each parcel in the district; billing charges directly or through a county tax roll; preparing the annual Engineer’s Report, budget and resolutions; reporting on collections and payment status; calculating prepayment quotes; and providing financial analyses, modeling and budget forecasting.
 The key to our district administration services is our proprietary software package, MuniMagic+SM: Municipal Administration & Government Information Coordinator, which we developed internally to redefine the way we administer special districts. MuniMagic+SM is a database management program that maintains parcel data; calculates special taxes, assessments, fees and charges; manages payment tracking; maintains bond‑related information in a single, central location; and provides reporting, financial modeling and analysis at multiple levels of detail. MuniMagic+SM offers a significant competitive advantage in an industry driven by the ability to accurately process large quantities of data.
 Financial Consulting. We perform economic analyses and financial projects for public agencies, including fee and rate studies, such as cost allocation studies and user fee analysis; utility rate analysis and utility system appraisals and acquisitions; economic development and redevelopment planning; Community Choice Aggregation feasibility studies, in which local entities contemplate aggregating buying power in order to secure alternative energy supply contracts; real estate and market analysis associated with planning efforts, and development fee studies; special district formation and other special projects.
 Federal Compliance. We offer several services that support bonded debt compliance reporting for cities, counties, states, school districts, water districts, housing authorities, 501C-3 and other municipal entities. We provide federal compliance services to approximately 750 issuers in 42 states and the District of Columbia managing approximately $70 billion in municipal debt.

 We are organized to profitably manage numerous small and large contracts at the same time. Our contracts typically range from $1,000 to over $10,000,000 in contract revenue. Our contracts typically have a duration of between two and thirty-six months, although we have city services contracts that have been in effect for over 30 years. At December 28, 2018, we had approximately 3,549 open projects. 
 Our largest clients are based in New York and California. In fiscal year 2018, services provided to clients in California accounted for approximately 35% of our contract revenue and services provided to clients in New York accounted for approximately 29% of our contract revenue.
 Along with our more typical shorter-term projects, we also derive substantial revenue from three significant long-term contracts with Consolidated Edison of New York, Inc. (“Consolidated Edison”), the City of Elk Grove (the “City of Elk Grove”) and the Dormitory Authority-State of New York (“DASNY”). For fiscal year 2018, Consolidated Edison, City of Elk Grove and DASNY represented 19%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated contract revenue.
 In January 2017, we announced a new three-year contract with Consolidated Edison to implement Consolidated Edison’s Commercial Direct Install (“CDI”) program across the utility's New York City and Westchester County service area. This program replaced and expanded Consolidated Edison's Small Business Direct Install (“SBDI”) program, which we had implemented since 2009, by increasing the size of eligible commercial customers and diversifying the program offerings. The Consolidated Edison contract continues through the end of 2019. The CDI program, Consolidated Edison's largest energy efficiency program, helps customers save energy, lower their bills and protect the environment by providing financial incentives to identify and buy down the cost of energy efficiency measures. To support this effort, we provide full-service program implementation including outreach and direct sales to potential commercial customers, on-site energy efficiency assessments, direct implementation of energy savings measures and subcontractor management.  While the contract does not obligate Consolidated Edison to engage us for a minimum amount of services, the contract terms, including amendments, provide for an anticipated budget for our services of up to $91.7 million of services over a three-year period, of which $35.2 million remained as of December 28, 2018. Consolidated Edison may terminate the contract at any time for any reason. 
 In connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Genesys Engineering, P.C. (“Genesys”) in March 2016, we entered into an administrative services agreement with Genesys pursuant to which our subsidiary, WES, provides Genesys with ongoing administrative, operational and other non-professional support services. Under such administrative services agreement, WES provides administrative services for a series of Genesys’s DASNY contracts. WES provides administrative services to Genesys in its performance of rehabilitation and construction work and architectural and engineering services at various sites within New York State for DASNY under these contracts, including energy efficient design, utility cost evaluation and review, and various regulatory compliance services. Specific project descriptions are set out by DASNY in work authorizations, which are issued under the terms of the contracts. The termination dates of the DASNY contracts vary; the latest of which was February 13, 2019. Work authorized but not yet completed under this contract continues to be bound by the terms of the agreement beyond the termination date until completion of the projects. Genesys expects to receive an amendment from DASNY to the master contract extending the termination date under DASNY’s option to extend this contract term twice, one year at a time. DASNY may at any time terminate any of the contracts or suspend all projects, for its convenience and without cause.
 Further, with our acquisition of Lime Energy in November 2018, we assumed Lime Energy’s customer relationships with Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Duke Energy Corp. For Lime Energy’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, revenue generated from Lime Energy’s utility programs associated with Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Duke Energy Corp. represented 67% of Lime Energy’s consolidated revenue. The amounts due from these two utilities represented 43% of the outstanding accounts receivable of Lime Energy as of December 31, 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, these utility programs represented 66% of Lime Energy’s consolidated revenue.

 Contract Structure
 We generally provide our services under contracts, purchase orders or retainer letters. The agreements we enter into with our clients typically incorporate one of three principal types of pricing provisions:
· | Time-and-materials provisions provide for reimbursement of costs and overhead plus a fee for labor based on the time expended on a project multiplied by a negotiated hourly billing rate. The profitability achievable on a time-and-materials basis is driven by billable headcount and cost control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Unit-based provisions require the delivery of specific units of work, such as energy efficiency savings goals measured in kWh or Therms, arbitrage rebate calculations, dissemination of municipal securities continuing disclosure reports, or building plan checks, at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units performed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fixed price provisions require all work under a contract to be performed for a specified lump sum, which may be subject to adjustment if the scope of the project changes. Contracts with fixed price provisions carry certain inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, delays in project completion, problems with new technologies, price increases for materials, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Consequently, the profitability, if any, of fixed price contracts can vary substantially. Willdan typically hedges some of these risks through the use of fixed price subcontracts for services, material and equipment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the approximate percentage of our contract revenue subject to each type of pricing provision:

 | Fiscal Year | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Time-and-materials | 27 | % | 19 | %
Unit-based | 47 | % | 32 | %
Fixed price | 26 | % | 49 | %
Total | 100 | % | 100 | %

  In relation to the pricing provisions, our service-related contracts, including operations and maintenance services and a variety of technical assistance services, are accounted for over the period of performance, in proportion to the cost of performance. Award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed and determinable and consider customer contract terms.
 For time-and-materials and fixed price contracts, we bill our clients periodically in accordance with the contract terms based on costs incurred, on either an hourly fee basis or on a percentage of completion basis, as the project progresses. For unit-based contracts, we bill our clients upon delivery of the contracted item or service, and in some cases, in advance of delivery.
 Our contracts come up for renewal periodically and at the time of renewal may be subject to renegotiation, which could impact the profitability on that contract. In addition, during the term of a contract, public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction. Most of our contracts permit our clients, with prior notice, to terminate the contracts at any time without cause. While we have a large volume of transactions and generally low customer concentration, the renewal, termination or modification of a contract may have a material effect on our consolidated operations.
 Competition
 The market for our services is highly fragmented. We often compete with many other firms ranging from small local firms to large national firms. Contract awards are based primarily on qualifications, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, geographic presence, stability and price.

 Doing business with utilities and governmental agencies is complex and requires the ability to comply with intricate regulations and satisfy periodic audits. We have been serving cities, counties, special districts and other public agencies for over 50 years. We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with utilities, governmental entities and agencies is a barrier to entry for potential competitors.
 Our competition varies by type of client, type of service and geography. The range of competitors for any one project can vary depending upon technical specialties, the relative value of the project, geographic location, financial terms, risks associated with the work, and any client imposed restrictions. Unlike most of our competitors, we focus our services on utilities and public sector clients. Utility and public sector clients generally choose among competing firms by weighing the quality, experience, innovation and timeliness of the firm’s services. When selecting consultants for engineering projects, many utilities and government agencies are required to, and others choose to, employ Qualifications Based Selection (“QBS”). QBS requires the selection of the most technically qualified firms for a project, while the financial and legal terms of the engagement are generally secondary. 
 Our competition varies geographically. Although we provide services in several states, we may be stronger in certain service lines in some geographical areas than in other regions. Similarly, some of our larger competitors are stronger in some service lines in certain localities but are not as competitive in others. Our smaller competitors generally are limited both geographically as well as by the services they are able to provide.
 We believe that our Energy and Engineering and Consulting segments compete with numerous competitors and no single competitor has sufficient market share to influence the market.
 Insurance
 We currently maintain the following insurance coverage: commercial general liability insurance, automobile liability insurance, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance and cyber liability insurance. We also carry professional liability insurance and an umbrella/excess liability insurance. We are liable to pay these claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits. Employees
 At December 28, 2018, we had approximately 927 full‑time employees and 275 part‑time employees. All Public Agency Resources’ employees are classified as part‑time. Our employees include, among others, licensed electrical, mechanical, structural and civil engineers, land surveyors, certified building officials, licensed geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists, certified inspectors and plans examiners, licensed architects and landscape architects, certified planners, and information technology specialists. We believe that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel with significant industry experience and strong client relationships by offering them challenging assignments in a stable work environment. We believe that our employee relations are good.
 The following table sets forth the number of our employees in each of our business segments and our holding company:

 | As of 
 | Fiscal Year End
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Energy | 677 | 381 | 334 
Engineering and Consulting | 469 | 448 | 446 
Holding Company Employees (Willdan Group, Inc.) | 56 | 53 | 51 
Total | 1,202 | 882 | 831 

  At December 28, 2018, we contracted with approximately 100 former and current public safety officers to conduct homeland security services training courses. These instructors are classified as subcontractors and not employees.
