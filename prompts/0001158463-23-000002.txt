ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
General
JetBlue Airways Corporation, or JetBlue, is New York's Hometown Airline®. As of December 31, 2022, JetBlue served over 100 destinations across the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, Canada, and England.
JetBlue was incorporated in Delaware in August 1998 and commenced service on February 11, 2000. We believe our differentiated product and culture combined with our competitive cost structure enables us to compete effectively in the high-value geographies we serve. Looking to the future, we plan to continue to grow in our high-value geographies, invest in industry leading products, and provide award-winning service by our 24,000+ dedicated employees, whom we refer to as crewmembers. Going forward, we believe we will continue to differentiate ourselves from other airlines, enabling us to continue to attract a greater mix of customers, and to drive continued growth. We are focused on delivering solid results for our stockholders, our customers, and our crewmembers. 
 As used in this Report, the terms “JetBlue,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms refer to JetBlue Airways Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our principal executive offices are located at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, Long Island City, New York 11101 and our telephone number is (718) 286-7900. 
Merger
Our acquisition of Spirit Airlines, Inc. (“Spirit”) will position us as a national low-fare challenger to the dominant U.S. carriers. The combined airline will allow us to accelerate our organic growth plan in both fleet size and increased relevance in certain key cities. Combining with Spirit will give us the opportunity to bring our unique blend of ultra-low fares and exceptional service to more customers, on more routes diversifying our network. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information on the merger. 
Our Industry and Competition
The U.S. airline industry is extremely competitive and challenging, and results are often volatile. It is uniquely susceptible to external factors such as fuel costs, downturns in domestic and international economic conditions, weather-related disruptions, the spread of infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, vaccination mandates, masking requirements and travel restrictions, the impact of airline restructurings or consolidations, and military actions or acts of terrorism. We operate in a capital and energy intensive industry that has high fixed costs, as well as heavy taxation and fees. Airline returns are sensitive to slight changes in fuel prices, average fare levels, and customer demand. The industry's principal competitive factors include fares, brand and customer service, route networks, flight schedules, aircraft types, safety records, codeshare and interline relationships, inflight entertainment and connectivity systems, and frequent flyer loyalty programs. 
The COVID-19 Pandemic
The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our operating revenues and financial position. We began seeing signs of demand recovery in February 2021 which continued to progress throughout 2021. Although the spread of the Omicron variant temporarily decelerated the demand for travel in early 2022, customer confidence continued to grow over the course of the year, resulting in our return to profitability in the second half of 2022. 
JETBLUE EXPERIENCE
 We offer our customers a distinctive flying experience which we refer to as the “JetBlue Experience”. We believe we deliver award-winning service and product with low fares that focuses on the entire customer experience, from booking an itinerary to arrival at the final destination. We believe JetBlue is the carrier of choice for the majority of travelers who have been underserved by other airlines.
Differentiated Product and Culture
Delivering the JetBlue Experience to our customers through our differentiated product and culture is core to our mission to inspire humanity. We look to attract new customers to our brand and provide current customers with a reason to come back by continuing to innovate and evolve the JetBlue Experience. We believe we can adapt to the changing needs of our customers and a key element of our success is the belief that competitive fares and great product need not be mutually exclusive. 
Our award winning service begins from the moment our customers purchase a ticket through one of our distribution channels such as www.jetblue.com, our mobile applications, or our reservations centers. Customers can purchase one of five branded fares: Blue Basic, Blue, Blue Plus, Blue Extra, and Mint®, our premium service. Each fare includes different offerings such as early boarding, advance seat selections, free checked bags, no change fees, and additional TrueBlue® points, with all 
Table of Contents

fares including our core offering of free inflight entertainment, free high-speed wi-fi, free snacks, and free non-alcoholic beverages. Customers can choose to “buy up” to an option with additional offerings. These different fares allow customers to select the products or services they need or value when they travel, without having to pay for the things they do not need or value. 
Upon arrival at the airport, our customers are welcomed by our dedicated crewmembers and can choose to purchase one or more of our ancillary options such as Priority Security, allowing them to enjoy an expedited security experience in most domestic JetBlue locations, or BlueCities. Customers who select our Blue Extra or Mint® fares receive Priority Security as part of their fare. We additionally have mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices which have robust features including real-time flight information updates and mobile check-in for certain routes. Our applications are designed to enhance our customers' travel experience and are in keeping with the JetBlue Experience. 
Our self-service layout in a majority of BlueCities redesigned the way our customers travel through the airport lobby. Our user-friendly kiosks are the first point of contact for each customer traveling through the airport lobby and allow for contact-less service. While all customers are encouraged to use the kiosks, our lobby layout allows them to choose the check-in experience they prefer. The self-service model allows crewmembers to get out from behind the ticket counter and move through the lobby to guide our customers through the check-in process and opens up the opportunity for our crewmembers to make personal connections with our customers, to assist with bag tagging, to answer customer questions, and to direct them to their next step in the travel experience. For customers who prefer a more traditional experience, our Help Desk offers full-service check-in. 
Once onboard our aircraft, customers enjoy seats in a comfortable layout with the most legroom in the main cabin of all U.S. airlines, based on average fleet-wide seat pitch. Our Even More® Space seats are available for purchase across our fleet, giving customers the opportunity to enjoy additional legroom. Customers on certain routes have the option to purchase Mint®, our premium service.
In February 2021, we unveiled a reimagined version of our Mint® experience. The new service includes a completely refreshed cabin design featuring private suites with a sliding door for every Mint® customer. Each Mint® aircraft also includes two Mint® Studio suites which offers the most space in a premium experience from any U.S. airline based on personal square footage per passenger seat. We debuted this new premium service with a 16-seat individual suite layout on select flights between New York and Los Angeles in June 2021. In August 2021, we began transatlantic flights from New York to London that included the new Mint® experience with 24 individual suites. In August 2022, we expanded our transatlantic flights flying from Boston to London, also with our Mint® experience. 
 Our inflight entertainment system onboard our aircrafts include free live TV with up to 100+ channels of DIRECTV® and 100+ channels of SiriusXM Radio® on select routes and premium movie channel offerings from JetBlue Features. Our entire fleet is equipped with Fly-Fi®, a broadband product that allows gate-to-gate Wi-Fi at every seat. Customers also have access to the Fly-Fi® Hub, a content portal where customers can access a wide range of movies, television shows, and additional content from their own personal devices. 
All customers may enjoy an assortment of free and unlimited snacks and non-alcoholic beverages and have the option to purchase additional products such as blankets, pillows, headphones, premium beverages, and premium food selections. Our Mint® customers have access to an assortment of complimentary food, beverages and products including a small-plates menu, artisanal snacks, alcoholic beverages, a blanket, pillows, and headphones. 
 Because of our network strength in leisure destinations, we also sell vacation packages through our wholly owned subsidiary, JetBlue Travel Products, LLC, or JetBlue Travel Products, a one-stop, value-priced vacation service for self-directed packaged travel planning. These packages offer competitive fares for air travel on JetBlue along with a selection of JetBlue-recommended hotels and resorts, car rentals, and local attractions. 
We work to provide a superior travel experience, including communicating openly and honestly with customers about delays and service disruptions. We have a Customer Bill of Rights which was introduced in 2007 to provide compensation to customers who experience inconveniences. This Customer Bill of Rights commits us to high service standards and holds us accountable if we fall short. We, like other airlines, have also committed to the government to provide services to mitigate customer inconveniences when the cause of cancellation or delay was due to circumstances in our control. These services include rebooking at no additional cost, meal and/or meal/cash vouchers for flight delays over three hours, complimentary hotel accommodations if necessary, and complimentary ground transportation to and from hotels. 
Table of Contents

Our customers have repeatedly indicated the distinctive JetBlue Experience is an important reason why they select us over other carriers. We measure and monitor customer feedback regularly which helps us to continuously improve customer satisfaction. One way we do so is by measuring our net promoter score, or NPS. This metric is used by companies in a broad range of industries to measure and monitor the customer experience. Many leading consumer brands that are recognized for great customer service receive high NPS scores. We believe a higher NPS score has positive effects on customer loyalty and ultimately leads to increased revenue.
Network
We are a predominately point-to-point system carrier with 93% of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities: New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Orlando, Los Angeles, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All six of our focus cities are in regions with a diverse mix of traffic. 
Leisure traveler focused airlines are often faced with high seasonality. As a result, we continually work to manage our mix of customers to include both business travelers and travelers visiting friends and relatives, or VFR. VFR travelers tend to be slightly less seasonal and less susceptible to economic downturns than traditional leisure destination travelers. Understanding the purpose of our customers' travel helps us to optimize destinations, strengthen our network, and increase unit revenues. 
As of December 31, 2022, our network served 108 BlueCities in 32 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 24 countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, Canada, and England, our first country in Europe. Largely enabled by the Northeast Alliance (the “NEA”) with American Airlines Group Inc. (“American”), we announced five new BlueCities and 10 new routes in 2022. We found new opportunities in destinations from New York and Boston that we did not serve prior to the NEA, including expanded service to the Midwest in 2022, as well as providing a network attractive to both business and leisure customers. 
We group our capacity distribution based upon geographical regions rather than on a mileage or a length-of-haul basis. The historic distribution of available seat miles (“ASMs”), or capacity, by region for the years ending December 31 was:

Capacity Distribution | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Transcontinental | 30.8 | % | | 31.0 | % | 31.7 | %
Caribbean & Latin America (1) | 32.5 | | | 36.8 | | 31.4 | 
Florida | 24.6 | | | 24.9 | | 27.4 | 
East | 5.1 | | | 3.2 | | 4.5 | 
Central | 5.0 | | | 3.0 | | 4.0 | 
West | 0.5 | | | 0.7 | | 1.0 | 
Transatlantic(2) | 1.5 | | | 0.4 | | — | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1) Domestic operations as defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but for the purposes of the capacity distribution table above, we have included these locations in the Caribbean and Latin America region.
(2) We further expanded our presence in the transatlantic market with service from Boston Logan International Airport, or Boston to London Gatwick and London Heathrow airports in August 2022. 
We have announced service to Paris, France in summer 2023 and four new routes beginning in spring 2023. We also announced service to Tallahassee, Florida starting in early 2024. 
Enabled by the NEA, we announced expanded Mint® flying and two new seasonal routes beginning in summer 2023. 
Airline Commercial Partnerships
Airlines frequently participate in commercial partnerships with other carriers in order to increase customer convenience by providing interline-connectivity, codeshare, complementary flight schedules, frequent flyer program reciprocity, and other joint marketing activities. As of December 31, 2022, we had 46 airline commercial partnerships. Our commercial partnerships typically begin as an interline agreement allowing a customer to book a single itinerary with tickets on multiple airlines. On their day of travel, they enjoy a simplified airport experience with single check-in and bag drop. 
Northeast Alliance
In July 2020, JetBlue and American entered into the NEA designed to optimize our respective networks at John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark and Boston. Following review by the DOT, JetBlue and American began implementing the NEA in July 2021. Since then, JetBlue and American have collectively grown across New York and 
Table of Contents

Boston, offering customers more options for travel. We are investing in a seamless customer experience and have also introduced loyalty benefits that will give both JetBlue and American customers the opportunity to earn and redeem on both airlines.
On September 21, 2021, the United States Department of Justice, along with the Attorneys General of six states and the District of Columbia filed suit against JetBlue and American seeking to enjoin the NEA, alleging that it violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The bench trial of this matter was concluded in October 2022, and the court held closing arguments in November 2022. The court’s decision remains pending. An adverse ruling could adversely impact our ability to achieve the intended benefits of the NEA and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we are incurring costs associated with implementing operational and marketing elements of the NEA, which would not be recoverable if we were required to unwind all or a portion of the NEA.
In December 2022 and February 2023, four putative class actions lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and the United States District Court of the District of Massachusetts, alleging, among other things, that monetary damages should be awarded to a putative class of direct purchasers of airline tickets from JetBlue and American on NEA flights from July 16, 2020 through the present. Given the nature of these cases, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, if any, arising from this matter; however, JetBlue believes these lawsuits are without merit and, along with American, will defend these matters vigorously.
In 2023, we expect to continue to seek additional strategic opportunities through new commercial partners as well as assess ways to deepen existing airline partnerships, including the NEA. We plan to do this by expanding codeshare relationships and other areas of cooperation such as frequent flyer programs. We believe these commercial partnerships allow us to better leverage our strong network and drive incremental traffic and revenue while improving off-peak travel.
Marketing 
JetBlue is a widely recognized and respected global brand. JetBlue created a new category in air travel and our brand stands for offering a great product with low fares. We believe this brand has evolved into an important and valuable asset which identifies us as a safe, reliable, and high value airline. Similarly, we believe customer awareness of our brand has contributed to the success of our marketing efforts. It enables us to promote ourselves as a preferred marketing partner with companies across many different industries. 
We market our services through advertising and promotions in various media forms including popular social media outlets. We engage in large multi-market programs, local events, and sponsorships across our route network as well as mobile marketing programs. Our targeted public and community relations efforts reflect our commitment to the communities we serve, promote brand awareness, and complement our strong reputation. 
Distribution
Our primary and preferred distribution channel to customers is through our website, www.jetblue.com, our lowest cost channel. Our website allows us to more closely control and deliver the JetBlue Experience while also offering the full suite of JetBlue Fare Options, Even More® Space and Speed, JetBlue Vacations®, and other ancillary services. 
Our participation in global distribution systems, or GDS, supports our profitable growth, particularly in the business market. We find business customers are more likely to book through a travel agency or a booking product which relies on a GDS platform. Although the distribution cost through this channel is higher than through our website, the average fare purchased through a GDS is generally higher and often covers the increased distribution costs. We currently participate in several major GDSs and online travel agents, or OTAs. Due to the majority of our customers booking travel on our website, we maintain relatively low distribution costs which helps us to offer lower fares to customers.
Customer Loyalty Program
TrueBlue® is our customer loyalty program designed to reward and recognize loyal customers. Members earn points based upon, among other methods, the amount paid for JetBlue flights and services from certain commercial partners. Our points do not expire, the program has no black-out dates, points can be redeemed for any open seat, and any JetBlue destination can be booked if the TrueBlue® member has enough points to exchange for the value of an open seat. TrueBlue Mosaic® is an additional program level for our most loyal customers.
In December 2022, we announced a new TrueBlue® Loyalty Program which will begin in middle of 2023, bringing more choices and new perks for customers. The new program maintains most of TrueBlue's® signature perks while also providing for new opportunities for customers to earn additional perks along the way to achieving Mosaic status. TrueBlue® will now offer tiles as the new way to track and measure progress toward Mosaic status. Tiles are earned based on a combination of travel spend and credit card spend. The new program is designed to ensure that even more TrueBlue® members have the opportunity 
Table of Contents

to get rewarded, even before achieving Mosaic® status. The new TrueBlue® also enhances the TrueBlue Mosaic® program to include four distinct Mosaic levels, each featuring a Mosaic signature perk and an additional Mosaic perk you pick. 
We currently have co-branded loyalty credit cards available to eligible U.S. residents, as well as co-brand agreements in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to allow cardholders to earn TrueBlue® points. Our co-branded credit cards in the United States are issued in partnership with Barclaycard® on the MasterCard® network. We also have co-branded loyalty credit cards issued by Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and MasterCard® in Puerto Rico as well as Banco Popular Dominicano and MasterCard® in the Dominican Republic. These credit cards allow customers in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic to take full advantage of our TrueBlue® loyalty program. In middle of 2023, we expect to introduce enhancements to our co-branded credit cards. JetBlue Plus Card members will be able to enjoy Points Payback, which will allow them to redeem points to pay themselves back from purchases of $25 and up. In addition, JetBlue business card members will enjoy early boarding on JetBlue-operated flights. 
We have various agreements with other loyalty partners, including financial institutions, hotels, and car rental companies, that allow their customers to earn TrueBlue® points through participation in our partners’ programs. We intend to continue to develop the footprint of our co-branded credit cards and pursue other loyalty partnerships in the future.
OPERATIONS AND COST STRUCTURE 
Historically, our cost structure has allowed us to price fares lower than many of our competitors and was a principal reason for our profitable growth prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Our cost advantage relative to some of our competitors was due to, among other factors, high aircraft utilization, new and efficient aircraft, relatively low distribution costs, and a productive workforce. Because our network initiatives and growth plans require a low cost platform, we strive to stay focused on our competitive costs, operational excellence, and efficiency improvements. We will remain nimble and expect to generate strong margins with the continued progress on our structural cost program. 
Route Structure 
JetBlue's point-to-point system is the foundation of our operational structure, with 93% of our routes touching at least one of our six focus cities. This structure allows us to optimize costs as well as accommodate customers' preference for nonstop itineraries. A vast majority of our operations are centered in the heavily populated northeast corridor of the U.S., which includes the New York and Boston metropolitan areas. This airspace is some of the world's most congested and drives certain operational constraints.
◦New York metropolitan area - We are New York's Hometown Airline®. Approximately one-half of our flights originate from or are destined for the New York metropolitan area. JFK is New York's largest airport, and we are the largest airline at JFK as measured by domestic seats. Our 2022 operations accounted for 39% of seats offered on domestic routes from JFK. At the end of 2022, we served 89 nonstop destinations from JFK. New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, or Newark, New York City's LaGuardia Airport, or LaGuardia, and New York's Westchester County Airport, or White Plains. In 2023, through the NEA with American, we expect to offer nearly 500 daily departures in New York. 
◦Boston - We are the largest carrier at Boston measured by domestic seats. At the end of 2022, we flew to 74 nonstop destinations from Boston and our operations accounted for 28% of all seats offered in Boston. We began service between Boston and London in August 2022. Together with American, the NEA will offer nearly 200 daily departures at Boston.
◦Caribbean and Latin America - At the end of 2022, we had 38 BlueCities in the Caribbean and Latin America. San Juan, Puerto Rico is our only focus city outside of the Continental U.S. We are a leading carrier in Puerto Rico serving three airports and 19 nonstop destinations. We are also the largest airline in the Dominican Republic, serving four airports and 17 nonstop destinations. 
◦Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood - We are a leading carrier at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, or Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, with approximately 21% of all seats offered in 2022. We served 55 nonstop destinations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood in 2022. In February 2023, we announced new service between Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood and Tallahassee International Airport beginning in early 2024. After the consummation of the Merger, we expect to reach more than 250 flights a day at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood by 2027. 
◦Orlando - We are the sixth largest carrier measured by seats at Orlando International Airport, or Orlando. At the end of 2022, we served 23 nonstop destinations from Orlando and our operations accounted for 10% of all seats offered in Orlando in 2022. 
Table of Contents

◦Los Angeles area - We are the seventh largest carrier in the Los Angeles area measured by seats, operating from Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, Burbank's Bob Hope Airport or Burbank, and Ontario International Airport or Ontario. In 2022, we continued to grow our presence in the Los Angeles area, at both LAX and Burbank. Increased services to JFK and Boston made up a significant part of this growth. At the end of 2022, we served 23 nonstop destinations from LAX and our operations accounted for 5% of all seats offered in 2022. 
Our peak levels of traffic over the course of the typical year vary by route. The East Coast to Florida/Caribbean routes typically peak from October through April and the West Coast routes typically peak in the summer months. Generally speaking, many of our areas of operations in the Northeast experience poor winter weather conditions, resulting in increased costs associated with de-icing aircraft, canceling flights, and accommodating displaced customers. Many of our Florida and Caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes. As we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses by other airlines. 
Fleet Structure
We currently operate five types of aircraft: Airbus A220, Airbus A320, Airbus A321, Airbus A321neo, and Embraer E190. As of December 31, 2022, our fleet had an average age of 12.4 years. 
 
Aircraft Type | Number of seats on aircraft | Number of aircraft in fleet at December 31, 2022
A220 | 140 | 14 
A320 | 150 | 11 
A320 Restyled(1) | 162 | 119 
A321 | 200 | 28 
A321 with Mint® | 159 | 35 
A321neo | 200 | 16 
A321neo with Mint® | 160 | 2 
A321neo LR with Mint® | 138 | 5 
Embraer E190(2) | 100 | 60 
Total | | 290 

(1) Our restyle program, which was completed in the first quarter of 2022, allowed us to increase capacity in a capital-efficient and customer-focused way.
 (2) As of December 31, 2022 we parked 9 of these aircraft.
The reliability of our fleet is essential to ensuring our operations run efficiently and we are continually working with our aircraft and engine manufacturers to enhance our performance.
Fleet Maintenance
Consistent with our core value of safety, our Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA-approved maintenance programs are administered by our technical operations department. We use qualified maintenance personnel and ensure they have comprehensive training. We maintain our aircraft and associated maintenance records in accordance with, if not exceeding, FAA regulations. 
 Fleet maintenance work is divided into three categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component maintenance.
The bulk of our line maintenance is handled by JetBlue technicians and inspectors. It consists of service checks, interior maintenance, weekly checks, phased “A” checks and “B” checks, along with periodic diagnostics, routine repairs, and non-routine component replacements. 
Heavy maintenance checks, or base maintenance, consist of a series of more complex maintenance, modification, and inspection tasks taking from one to six weeks to complete and are typically performed once every 24-36 months. All of our aircraft heavy maintenance work is performed by third party FAA-Certified Repair Stations and are subject to direct oversight by JetBlue personnel. We outsource heavy maintenance as the costs are lower than if we were to perform the tasks internally. 
Component maintenance on equipment such as engines, auxiliary power units, landing gears, pumps, and avionic computers are all performed by a number of different FAA-Certified Repair Stations that are surveilled and approved by JetBlue. We have fixed price agreements for the repair, overhaul, modification, and logistics of our Airbus aircraft engines. We have flight hour agreements for our Embraer E190, Airbus A220, and Airbus A321neo aircraft engines. Many of our 
Table of Contents

maintenance service agreements are based on a fixed cost per flight hour. These fixed costs vary based upon the age of the aircraft and other operating factors impacting the related component. Required maintenance not otherwise covered by these agreements is performed on a time and materials basis. All other maintenance activities are sub-contracted to qualified maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities. 
Aircraft Fuel
Aircraft fuel continues to be one of our largest expenses. Price has been extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors which we can neither control nor accurately predict. Our 2022 fuel consumption increased by 21.0% compared to 2021 due to higher capacity in 2022 as demand for travel returned, and our average price per gallon increased 79% compared to 2021. Our historical fuel consumption and costs for the years ended December 31 were:
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Gallons consumed (millions) | 842 | | | 696 | | | 412 | 
Total cost (millions)(1) | $ | 3,105 | | | $ | 1,436 | | | $ | 631 
Average price per gallon(1) | $ | 3.69 | | | $ | 2.06 | | | $ | 1.53
Percent of operating expenses | 32.8 | % | | 23.5 | % | | 13.5 | %

(1) Total cost and average price per gallon each include related fuel taxes as well as effective fuel hedging gains and losses.
We attempt to protect ourselves against the volatility of fuel prices by entering into a variety of derivative instruments. These include call spread options, call options, swaps, caps, collars, and basis swaps with underlyings of jet fuel, crude, and heating oil.
Financial Health
As we continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we made great strides towards repairing our balance sheet, having paid down approximately $359 million of debt between 2021 and 2022. We also remain very focused on maintaining a healthy liquidity balance, ending the year with $1.6 billion. Our balance sheet remains one of the industry's strongest with an adjusted debt to capital ratio of 52%. We were able to leverage the strength of our balance sheet and unencumbered asset base to secure the funding to support the Spirit acquisition. 
In 2022, we generated approximately $379 million in cash from operations, resulting in approximately $544 million in negative free cash flow. We also reduced our total debt balance by $359 million from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2021 to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The net book value of our assets pledged, or committed to be pledged, as security under various financing arrangements increased by $470 million from $5.7 billion at December 31, 2021 to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2022.

Table of Contents

vision of inspiring humanity, extending our reach further across the travel ribbon to offer customers an even more seamless travel experience. 
JetBlue Vacations® offers customers the ability to package JetBlue flights with hotels and, as of October 2021, cruises into a single trip. Customers receive savings from packaging experiences, as well as a series of unique benefits launched in 2020 that include early boarding, free inflight drinks, free Insider Experience, access to VIP perks, and flexible payment options. In December 2022, we entered a partnership with Uber, through which customers booking packages to select destinations also receive a free ride credit.
In March 2021, we introduced PaislyTM by JetBlue® (“Paisly”), a travel website where customers get access to savings and earn TrueBlue points on cars, hotel stays, and activities. PaislyTM complements the JetBlue Vacations® brand by focusing on customers looking to book each travel component individually rather than as a bundled package. In June 2022, we announced new enhancements to PaislyTM including proactive customer support, new activities, increased inventory of stays, and a new refreshed look and feel. In February 2023, we announced an update to PaislyTM, opening access to all travelers, not just those with a JetBlue flight.
In June 2022, we announced a multi-year partnership extension with Allianz Partners USA, providing JetBlue customers the ability to protect both their flights and vacation packages with travel insurance. This partnership will provide safety, security, and peace of mind to our customers. 
In September 2022, we announced the launch of Troupe, a free and collaborative trip planning application designed to ease the stress of planning a trip with a large group of friends or family. We believe Troupe is the next step in creating unique and differentiated travel experiences for our customers. 
JFK Terminal 6
In November 2022, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, or PANYNJ, acting as lessor, entered into a ground lease agreement with JFK Millennium Partner LLC (“JMP”), a private company owned by Vantage Airport Group, RXR Realty, American Triple I Partners, and JetBlue, to facilitate the redevelopment of Terminal 6 at JFK. Simultaneously, the Governor of the State of New York and the PANYNJ announced that JMP had secured the necessary financing to move forward with the construction of the terminal project. JetBlue became a minority investor with a 5% interest in JMP in exchange for providing a letter of credit in the amount of $65 million to join our partners in financing, developing, and operating the new Terminal 6. Construction started in early 2023 with the opening of the first new gates expected in 2026 and project completion scheduled to take place in early 2028. 
TWA Flight Center Hotel 
In 2015, the Board of Commissioners of the PANYNJ approved a construction plan to redevelop the TWA Flight Center at JFK on its nearly six-acre site into a hotel with over 500 rooms, meeting spaces, restaurants, a spa, and an observation deck. As part of the plan, a 75-year lease agreement was entered into between the PANYNJ and the Flight Center Hotel, LLC, a partnership of MCR Development, LLC and JetBlue. The TWA Flight Center Hotel opened for business in 2019. As of December 31, 2022, we have an approximate 10% ownership interest in the hotel.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Our People and Culture
We believe our success depends on our crewmembers delivering the JetBlue Experience in the sky and on the ground. One of our competitive strengths is a service oriented culture grounded in our five key values: safety, caring, integrity, passion, and fun. We believe a highly productive and engaged workforce enhances customer loyalty. Our goal is to hire, train, and retain a diverse workforce of caring, passionate, fun, and friendly people who share our mission to inspire humanity.
We first introduce our culture to new crewmembers during the screening process and then at an extensive new hire orientation program at JetBlue University, our training center in Orlando. Orientation focuses on the JetBlue strategy, culture and values, and emphasizes the importance of teamwork, customer service, productivity, and cost control. These programs provide an opportunity for both crewmembers and external applicants to pursue a path to joining JetBlue in one of these critical roles.
Our growth plans necessitate and facilitate opportunities for talent development. For highly skilled careers as pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians, we offer a suite of industry-leading career development programs known as JetBlue Gateways for both crewmembers and external applicants to pursue a path to becoming a pilot or maintenance technician at JetBlue. There are seven distinct Gateway education and training paths:
Table of Contents

•Gateway University - Open to crewmembers and external applicants, students at Aviation Accreditation Board International accredited partner colleges and universities can become first officers via a prescribed, time-building pathway.
•Gateway Select - Open to crewmembers and external applicants, candidates with little or no flying experience can become pilots after a rigorous training and time-building program.
•Gateway Direct - Flight Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants can depart on a prescribed college education, training, and time-building pathway with a partner school and airline to becoming a pilot.
•Gateway Flex - Flight Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants looking for flexibility in becoming a pilot can choose their own location for training and time-building within a defined framework.
•Gateway Direct - Technical Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants enroll in a defined training and experience-building pathway to becoming an aircraft maintenance technician.
•Gateway Flex- Technical Operations: Open to crewmembers only, participants can depart their current position and pursue a flexible path to becoming an aircraft maintenance technician within a defined framework.
•Gateway Family - Open to immediate family of current crewmembers, participants can apply to join Gateway Direct to train to become a first officer through a defined education, training, and time-building path.
In 2021, we launched two development programs focused on creating greater access to select career paths, fostering equity by removing barriers to entry and increasing representation in senior leadership roles. One of the programs, known as JetBlue Emerging Talent (“JET”), offers a pathway for our frontline operational crewmembers to transition into corporate services roles which includes hands-on experience, rotational job placements, and job placement assistance upon completion of the program. We welcomed the first cohort of 12 participants rotating through the organization in 2021, and our second cohort began in January 2023. Our JET platform also includes two college-level internship programs (spring and summer), that provide skill and professional development through participation in developing real-world business solutions that support the delivery of strategic business initiatives. 
The other program, known as Gateway Direct, was added to our growing suite of development Gateways and provides opportunities specifically for crewmembers with aspirations to pursue careers inflight operations or technical operations. Gateway Direct was designed to address many of the largest barriers to entry for these careers such as financing and fears of leaving their current job at JetBlue, while adding certainty and a defined pathway to the process. In 2022, we welcomed 21 students into our Gateway Direct-Flight Operations program and 2 students into our Gateway Direct-Technical Operations program. 
We provide additional professional and leadership development programs to elevate the performance and support the career growth of our crewmembers. We offer broad-based access to learning and development through our enterprise license for LinkedIn learning, providing on-demand access to over 16,000 skill-based online learning courses. For crewleaders, we provide our Principles of Leadership program for new and newly promoted leaders at all levels, enabling them to lead their teams effectively and use their leadership role to sustain our culture by leading in accordance with JetBlue company values. For senior leaders, we host Leadership Roundtables for director-level talent across the organization to build relationships with each other and also with the Senior Leadership Team, focusing on key aspects of leadership to enhance their effectiveness and impact. 
We believe a direct relationship between crewmembers and our leadership is in the best interests of our crewmembers, our customers, and our stockholders. Except for our pilots and inflight crewmembers, our other frontline crewmembers do not have third-party representation. In 2014, JetBlue pilots elected to be represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, or ALPA. The National Mediation Board, or NMB, certified ALPA as the representative for JetBlue pilots. The parties reached a final agreement for our first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by the pilots in July 2018. The agreement was for a four-year renewable contract effective August 1, 2018. In February 2022, the parties commenced negotiations for a successor contract, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. JetBlue and ALPA reached a tentative agreement (“TA”) in mid-December 2022 to extend the current collective bargaining agreement by two years; the TA was ratified by the JetBlue pilots in January 2023.
In April 2018, JetBlue inflight crewmembers elected to be represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU. The NMB certified the TWU as the representative for JetBlue inflight crewmembers. The parties reached a final agreement for the first collective bargaining agreement which was ratified by our inflight crewmembers in December 2021. The agreement is a five-year, renewable contract effective December 13, 2021.
In September 2022, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers filed for an election to unionize our ground operations crewmembers. In February 2023, our crewmembers voted to maintain our direct relationship rather than elect a union.
Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2022, approximately 48% of our full-time equivalent crewmembers were represented by unions. The following table sets forth our crewmember groups and the status of their respective collective bargaining agreements. 
Crewmember Group | Representative | Crewmembers(1) | Amendable Date(2)
Pilots | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 4,314 | February 1, 2025 
Inflight | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 5,603 | December 13, 2026

(1) Approximate number of active full-time equivalent crewmembers as of December 31, 2022.
(2) Our relations with our labor organizations are governed by Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, pursuant to which the collective bargaining agreements between us and these organizations do not expire but instead become amendable as of a certain date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
We have individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA licensed crewmembers which consist of dispatchers, technicians, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and renews for an additional five-year term. In the event of a downturn in our business, resulting in a reduction of flying and related work hours, we are obligated to pay these crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits. We provide what we believe to be industry-leading job protection through these agreements. We believe these agreements provide JetBlue and crewmembers flexibility and allow us to react to crewmembers needs' more efficiently than collective bargaining agreements.
A key feature of the direct relationship with our crewmembers is our Values Committees, which are made up of peer-elected frontline crewmembers from each of our major work-groups other than pilots and inflight crewmembers. Values Committees represent the interests of our work-groups and help us to run our business in a productive and efficient manner. We believe this direct relationship with crewmembers drives higher levels of engagement and alignment with JetBlue’s strategy, culture, and overall goals.
We believe the efficiency and engagement of our crewmembers is a result of our flexible and productive work rules. We are cognizant of the competition for productive labor in key industry positions and new government rules requiring higher qualifications as well as more restricted hours that may result in potential labor shortages in the upcoming years. In 2022, we saw upward pressure on wages within many of the markets we serve and this trend is expected to continue in 2023. 
Our leadership team communicates on a regular basis with all crewmembers to bolster our culture and to keep them informed about news, strategy updates, and challenges affecting the airline and the industry. Effective and frequent communication throughout the organization is fostered through various means including weekly email messages from our CEO and other senior leaders, weekday news updates to all crewmembers, crewmember engagement surveys, and active leadership participation in new hire orientations. Leadership is also heavily involved in periodic open forum meetings (virtual and in-person) across our network, called “pocket sessions,” which are often recorded and posted on our intranet and crewmember communications app, called On The Fly. By soliciting feedback for ways to improve our service, teamwork, and work environment, our leadership team works to keep crewmembers engaged and makes our business decisions transparent. 
Our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of 
 
Crewmember Group | Number of full time crewmembers
Pilots | 4,102 
Inflight | 5,528 
Airport operations | 4,300 
Technicians | 813 
Reservation agents | 1,362 
Management and other personnel | 3,970 

 (1) other airlines may refer to as flight attendants
 (2) other airlines may refer to as mechanics
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we employed an average of 16,669 full-time and 4,232 part-time crewmembers.
Our average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers increased by 20.3% compared to 2021, primarily driven by additional hiring, as we returned our operations to pre-pandemic levels. When compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, our average full-time equivalent crewmembers increased by 8.3%.

All JetBlue crewmembers have the right to an open and respectful workplace. Our Code of Conduct prohibits all forms of discrimination, and we promote open communication to resolve any discrimination concerns. Every JetBlue director-level crewmember and above is required to participate in unconscious bias training.
Crewmember Programs
We are committed to supporting our crewmembers through a number of programs including: 
•Crewmember Resource Groups (CRGs) - We encourage crewmembers to celebrate their individuality and build camaraderie through our various CRGs. CRGs spearhead programs to embrace and encourage the sharing of different perspectives, thoughts, and ideas. At the end of 2022, we had eight CRGs which include:
◦BlueAbilities: New in 2022, BlueAbilities promotes the inclusion of people with visible and nonvisible disabilities and champions an accessibility-friendly workplace. 
◦Blue Aviasian: Celebrates the history of Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders. The group offers immersive cultural experiences, networking, and career development events.
◦Blue Conexión: Shares the Latino culture and language in the workplace and community.
◦JADE (JetBlue African Diaspora Experience): Explores the rich cultures of the African diaspora. JADE leads cultural events during Black History Month and hosts TravelCon, a day-long event for crewmembers to learn about the diverse experience of Black travelers, among other events.
◦JetPride: Offers professional development opportunities for LGBTQ+ crewmembers and their allies. During Pride Month, crewmembers march across the network to celebrate diversity, equality, and acceptance.
◦SAJE (South Asian JetBlue Experience): Shines a light on the immensely diverse cultures and communities that make up South Asia. It provides an opportunity for our crewmembers who identify as South Asian to connect with one another, and for all crewmembers to better understand their unique backgrounds, culture, and experiences. 
◦Vets in Blue: Provides a forum for crewmembers who honorably serve or have served in the Armed Forces. Vets in Blue strengthens JetBlue’s efforts to employ and retain members of the military through outreach, networking events, career fairs, and mentoring opportunities. Many former service members enjoy second careers with JetBlue in airport operations, corporate security, inflight, flight operations, and more.
◦Women in Flight: Provides members with educational networking opportunities that inspire career and personal growth. Typically, the group hosts our annual Fly Like a Girl event, teaching young girls about different career paths in aviation. 
•JetBlue Crewmember Crisis Fund (JCCF) - This organization, originally formed in 2002, is a non-profit corporation independent from JetBlue and recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt entity. JCCF was created to assist JetBlue crewmembers and their immediate family members (IRS Dependents) with short-term financial support in times of crisis and unexpected emergencies when other resources are not available. Funds for JCCF grants come directly from crewmember donations via a tax-deductible payroll deduction. The assistance process is confidential with only the fund administrator and coordinator knowing the identity of the crewmembers in need.
•JetBlue Scholars - Developed in 2015, this program offers a new and innovative model to our crewmembers wishing to further their education. Crewmembers enrolled in the program can earn an undergraduate degree through self-directed online college courses facilitated by JetBlue. This re-emphasizes our continuous effort to help provide assistance to our most valued asset, our people. To build on the program, we introduced the Master's Pathway program in 2019 which is designed to help crewmembers who would like to advance their education even further by pursuing a master's degree. The Master's Pathway program partners with reputable institutions to provide a variety of benefits to crewmembers including tuition discounts, scholarships, and access to specialized support services.
• Lift Recognition Program - Created in 2012, this crewmember recognition program encourages crewmembers to celebrate their peers for living JetBlue's values by sending e-thanks through an online platform. 
Community Programs
JetBlue is committed to supporting the communities and BlueCities we serve through a variety of community programs including:
•Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - The CSR strategy, JetBlue For Good, focuses on three areas that our customers and crewmembers are passionate about: (1) youth and education, (2) community, and (3) environment. 
Table of Contents

◦Youth and Education: As a pillar of JetBlue For Good, our youth and education efforts focus on providing children from underserved areas the resources needed to obtain a quality education and sustainable careers. We do this through various initiatives including donating age-appropriate books to areas where books are scarce outside of school walls. We also host regular career days that help expose young adults to the careers available to them upon graduation and beyond.
◦Community: We have a longstanding tradition of supporting dedicated community organizations that make our BlueCities better. We show our support through partnerships, donations, and more than 1.3 million volunteer hours logged by our crewmembers since 2011.
◦Environment: JetBlue’s primary environmental sustainability priority is reducing and managing carbon emissions from jet fuel. We are committed to investing in more fuel-efficient technologies, renewable fuels, electric ground service equipment, logistics, and other measures to reduce our carbon footprint.
•JetBlue Foundation - Created in 2013 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, the JetBlue Foundation is a JetBlue-sponsored organization focused on raising awareness for careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and aviation. The JetBlue Foundation focuses on four main areas:
◦Partnering with organizations and communities to provide access to STEM programs for students from traditionally underserved communities;
◦Investing in programs geared toward students from diverse backgrounds to create a lifelong interest in STEM as early as possible in students' academic careers;
◦Creating equal opportunities and increasing access for all students to spark a passion for STEM; and
◦Building a more diverse talent pipeline for the aviation industry.
Environmental, Social, and Governance Management
Mitigating risks to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business is imperative for JetBlue. We remain focused on continuing to lead in environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, through ambitious target setting, clear actions and strategy, and transparent reporting. 
Environmental 
JetBlue has a long history of being a leader within the aviation industry in mitigating climate risk and reducing emissions associated with its operation, with an ultimate target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. In 2022, we announced our validated science-based emissions reduction target, our most aggressive near-term sustainability goal to date, with a plan to effectively reduce our well-to-wake (lifecycle) scope 1 and 3 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions related to jet fuel in half on a per-seat basis by 2035 from 2019 levels. While this target can only be successful with industry and policy support, JetBlue committed to increasing its focus and investments in lower-carbon solutions, within the scope of its business operations, to achieve these targets.
With sustainability as one of our key company-wide strategic priorities, we are pursuing the following six key levers to reduce the emissions associated with our business:
(1) Aircraft Efficiency: Our investments in new next generation aircraft are increasing fuel efficiency and reducing associated costs. Our growing fleet of Airbus A321neo aircraft are improving fuel economy by approximately 20%. Further, JetBlue continues to take delivery of Airbus A220s, reducing emissions by up to 35% per seat compared to the aircraft they are replacing. To support fuel efficiency and cost goals, JetBlue is accelerating the retirement of its E190 fleet, with the final E190 aircraft scheduled to exit the fleet in 2026. Since 2019, we have taken deliveries of 23 Airbus A321neo aircraft and 14 Airbus A220 aircraft. Going forward, we expect to take delivery of 62 Airbus A321neo aircraft and 86 Airbus A220 aircraft. 
(2) Fuel Optimization: We continuously fine-tune our operations to identify new fuel-savings opportunities and ensure adherence to existing fuel savings procedures. We operate a cross-functional team that reviews, analyzes, and implements fuel-savings opportunities across our operation and multiple workgroups. Opportunities include the promotion of single-engine taxi and single-engine taxi without auxiliary power, improved ground power and pre-conditioned air hookup times when aircraft arrive at gates, investing in ground power infrastructure for use during maintenance, and improvements to dispatch procedures to reduce over fueling (reducing onboard weight).
(3) Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”): We view the adoption of SAF as the most promising lever for us to significantly reduce emissions in our drive to net zero. We regularly fly with SAF on our existing aircraft which reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 80% per gallon before being blended with conventional jet fuel. JetBlue is the only U.S. carrier today to be flying regular domestic flights with supply from the two currently commercially-available SAF producers (Neste and World Energy), while supporting a portfolio of emerging suppliers with significant commitments.
Table of Contents

As of December 2022, JetBlue had five public and active SAF partners for current and future supply, which will support our target to convert 10% of our jet fuel usage to SAF by 2030. 
In 2022, JetBlue announced three new SAF deals. In April 2022, we announced an agreement with Aemetis for it to supply us with 125 million gallons of SAF over a ten-year term with a target start date of 2025. In September 2022, we signed an intent to purchase 25 million gallons of SAF from AIR COMPANY, an innovative carbon technology company creating carbon-negative alcohols and fuels from CO2, with a target start date of 2027. Our Memorandum of Understanding with AIR COMPANY comes on the heels of a direct capital investment into the company’s Series A funding round from JBV. In December 2022, we announced a non binding agreement with Fidelis New Energy for it to supply us with 92 million gallons of SAF over a five-year term with a target start date in 2025. 
(4) Electric Ground Operations: Where feasible, we are converting our Ground Service Equipment (“GSE”) to electric and maximizing electric ground power and air systems for our aircraft to minimize our fuel use and emissions on the ramp. We are committed to converting 40% of our GSE to electric by 2025, and 50% by 2030. We do not expect this conversion program to have a material impact on our annual capital expenditures. 
(5) Technology Partnerships: We are committed to playing an active role in advancing the future of sustainable aviation technologies. Through JBV, we support and invest in alternative energy aircraft technologies, such as those developing electric- and hydrogen-fueled aircraft. In 2022, JBV announced an investment in Rubicon Carbon, a next generation carbon solutions provider also backed by TPG Rise Climate, the climate investing strategy of TPG’s global impact investing platform TPG Rise. Starting in October 2021, we, along with JBV, formed the Aviation Climate Task Force with nine other airlines and the Boston Consulting Group. Together, we plan to invest in and facilitate the development of emerging technologies to decarbonize aviation.
(6) Carbon Offsetting: We believe that there is a role for high-integrity carbon credits to help offset emissions that we are unable to avoid today. JetBlue is proud to have voluntarily offset more than 11 million metric tons of CO2 emissions through 2022. As lower-carbon solutions within the airline’s operations have become more readily available, we have started to reduce the volume of carbon offsets purchased and ended the domestic carbon neutrality initiative launched in 2020. To further high-quality, high-integrity carbon credit availability in the voluntary carbon market, JetBlue joined the Business Alliance to Scale Climate Solutions (BASCS) in 2022 as the first airline member to open opportunities for investment, policy influence, and discussions with other corporations and nongovernmental organizations ("NGOS")/intergovernmental organizations ("IGOS") in aligned messaging around scaling climate solutions.
In January 2022, we announced the launch of the JetBlue Sustainable Travel Partners Program to help corporate travel customers reduce their business travel emissions and meet their own corporate sustainability targets. In keeping with JetBlue’s customer focus, we provide corporate travel partners with personalized data and resources to help them enhance the sustainability of their travel through SAF certificates, carbon offsetting, personalized travel data and analysis for corporate reporting, and consultation and tools for custom planning and target-setting.
Social
Every day we aim to live our mission of inspiring humanity by driving inclusion both inside and outside the Company. While we recognize that there is a lack of diversity in certain areas of the commercial aviation industry, we are taking steps to address that challenge.
Our efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) are centered around three key areas: (1) people; (2) sourcing; and (3) brand. 
•People
◦Develop a hiring process that mitigates harmful biases in order to improve representation of talent at all levels of the Company. 
◦Educate and inform on DEI through informal learning and review of practices and policies.
◦Focus on our people, continue to promote, and invest in diverse talent.
◦Our goal is to double our racial and ethnic minority representation at the officer and director level to 25%, and to increase our female representation at these levels to 40%, by the end of 2025.
•Sourcing
◦Engage minority and women-owned business enterprises with a proven commitment to DEI in their lines of business. Our goal is to grow our spend with businesses owned by underrepresented groups by 5% annually. In 2022, we engaged with 210 diverse business partners and spent $74 million with diverse businesses.
•Brand
Table of Contents

◦Ensure inclusivity in our offerings by capturing the diverse needs across our customer base.
◦Partner with values-aligned businesses and organizations within the communities we serve.
◦Evaluate social and market shifts and their impact on our customers' experience.
Governance
We believe that strong corporate governance, informed by direct engagement with our stakeholders, creates the foundation that allows us to pursue our mission to inspire humanity. We strive to conduct our business in ways that are principled, transparent, and accountable to our stakeholders.
We regularly develop, evaluate, and reshape company policies and procedures to ensure fairness and alignment to our values. We take a proactive approach to tracking, operationalization, and mitigation of risks JetBlue faces. This includes climate risk scenario planning and internal response protocols in response to ESG trends. We are dedicated to disclosing accurate data across a variety of material topics such as governance, executive pay, company emissions, and workforce diversity.
Our Board of Directors (“Board”) has ultimate oversight of enterprise risks and is informed of these risks quarterly by the Audit Committee and at least annually by the Governance and Nominating Committee. In 2019, our Board formed an ESG Subcommittee to the Governance and Nominating Committee to ensure the Board is aware of the Company's ESG strategy and has a comprehensive understanding of ESG matters, which we continued to operate throughout 2022.
We report annually on ESG issues using the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures frameworks. Our Environmental Social Governance Report can be found on our Investor Relations website.
Emergence from the COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to prioritize the safety of our crewmembers while continuing to support the needs of our operations during this period.
We faced challenges in early 2022 due to the spread of the Omicron variant, staffing ramp up, weather events, and air traffic delays. To address these challenges we responded with schedule reduction, increased hiring efforts, and continued operational investments. Over the course of the year, we saw demand and revenue trends accelerate, resulting in our return to profitability in the third and fourth quarters of 2022. 
REGULATION
Airlines are heavily regulated, with rules and regulations set by various federal, state, and local agencies. We also operate under specific regulations due to our operations within the high density airspace of the Northeast. Most of our airline operations are regulated by U.S. governmental agencies, including:
DOT - The DOT primarily regulates economic issues affecting air service including, but not limited to, certification and fitness, insurance, consumer protection, and competitive practices. It has the authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, including its tarmac delay, full fare advertising and fair and deceptive practice regulations, and may assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority, and seek criminal sanctions for various levels and manners of non-compliance.
FAA - The FAA primarily regulates flight operations, in particular, matters affecting air safety. This includes but is not limited to airworthiness requirements for aircraft, the licensing of pilots, mechanics and dispatchers, and the certification of flight attendants. It requires each airline to obtain an operating certificate authorizing the airline to operate at specific airports using specified equipment. Like all U.S. certified carriers, JetBlue cannot fly to new destinations without the prior authorization of the FAA. After providing notice and a hearing, the FAA has the authority to modify, suspend temporarily or revoke permanently our authority to provide air transportation or that of our licensed personnel for failure to comply with FAA regulations. It can additionally assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain FAA regulations. When significant safety issues are involved, it can revoke a U.S. carrier's authority to provide air transportation on an emergency basis, without providing notice and a hearing. It monitors our compliance with maintenance as well as flight operations and safety regulations. It maintains a requisite level of oversight and performs frequent in-person spot inspections of our aircraft, crewmembers, and records. The FAA also has the authority to issue airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders. This includes the inspection of aircraft and engines, fire retardant and smoke detection devices, collision and wind shear avoidance systems, noise abatement, and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. We have and maintain FAA certificates of airworthiness for all of our aircraft and have the necessary FAA authority to fly to all of the destinations we currently serve. 
Table of Contents

Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection - The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, operate under the Department of Homeland Security and are responsible for all civil aviation security. This includes passenger and baggage screening; cargo security measures; airport security; assessment and distribution of intelligence; security research and development; international passenger screening; customs; and agriculture. They also have enforcement powers and the authority to issue regulations, including in cases of national emergency, without a notice or comment period. They can also assess civil penalties for such failures as well as institute proceedings for the imposition and collection of monetary fines for the violation of certain regulations. 
Taxes & Fees - The airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the U.S., with taxes and fees accounting for approximately 15% of the total fare charged to a customer. Airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer. The September 11 Security Fee which is set by the TSA and is passed through to the customer, is currently $5.60 per enplanement, regardless of the number of connecting flights, and a round trip fee is limited to a maximum of $11.20. Effective December 28, 2015, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Aircraft Inspection fee increased from $70.75 to $225 per international aircraft arriving in the U.S.
State and Local - In addition to the federal regulations with which we must comply, we are also subject to state and local laws and regulations in the states in which we operate and the regulations of various local authorities operating the airports we serve.
Airport Access - JFK, LaGuardia, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, are slot-controlled airports subject to the “High Density Rule” and successor rules issued by the FAA, or Slots. These rules were implemented due to the high volume of traffic at these popular airports located in the northeast corridor airspace. The rules limit the air traffic in and out of these airports during specific times; however, even with the rules in place, delays remain among the highest in the nation due to continuing airspace congestion. Additionally, we have Slots at other Slot-controlled airports governed by unique local ordinances not subject to the High Density Rule, such as Westchester County Airport in White Plains, NY. Gate access is another common issue at certain airports. 
Foreign Operations - International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. The availability of international routes to U.S. airlines is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments. We currently operate international service to Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Canada, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, England, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Saint Lucia, St. Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. We anticipate further expanding our network to Paris, France in 2023. To the extent we seek to provide air transportation to additional international markets in the future, we would be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and the FAA as well as the applicable foreign government.
We believe we are operating in compliance with DOT, FAA, TSA, CBP and applicable international regulations as well as hold all necessary operating and airworthiness authorizations and certificates. Should any of these authorizations or certificates be modified, suspended, or revoked, our business could be materially adversely affected.
Other
Environmental - We are subject to various federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. This includes the regulation of GHG emissions, the discharge or disposal of materials and chemicals, as well as the regulation of aircraft noise administered by numerous state and federal agencies.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures as long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with the interstate and foreign commerce of the national air transportation system. Certain airports, including San Diego airport, have established restrictions to limit noise which can include limits on the number of hourly or daily operations and the time of such operations. These limitations are intended to protect the local noise-sensitive communities surrounding the airport. Our scheduled flights at San Diego airport are in compliance with the noise curfew limits, but on occasion when we experience irregular operations, we may violate these curfews. 
Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and ground operations emissions. In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program intended to promote carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. Annual international emissions reporting is required via CORSIA as of the 2019 reporting year, and offsetting compliance is scheduled to be implemented through multiple phases beginning in 2021. In 2020, given the impacts of COVID-19 which dramatically reduced 2020 emissions, ICAO agreed that the baseline from which the industry achieves carbon neutral growth would be from 2019 only, rather than an average of 2019 and 2020 as originally 
Table of Contents

intended. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but we expect compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
As part of our sustainability and environmental strategy, we are embracing new technologies and making changes that will ultimately benefit our crewmembers, customers, and stockholders. We discuss some of our sustainability initiatives in “Environmental, Social Governance – Environmental” above.
Foreign Ownership - Under federal law and DOT regulations, JetBlue must be controlled by U.S. citizens. In this regard, our chief executive officer and at least two-thirds of our board of directors must be U.S. citizens. Further, no more than 24.99% of our outstanding common stock may be voted by non-U.S. citizens. We believe we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions.
Other Regulations - All airlines are subject to certain provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 due to their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. They are also required to obtain an aeronautical radio license from the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. To the extent we are subject to FCC requirements, we take all necessary steps to comply with those requirements.
Additionally, as a result of our operations to Havana, Cuba, we are required to comply with regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. 
Our labor relations are covered under Title II of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 and are subject to the jurisdiction of the NMB. 
In addition, during periods of fuel scarcity, access to aircraft fuel may be subject to federal allocation regulations. 
Civil Reserve Air Fleet - We are a participant in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program, which permits the U.S. Department of Defense to utilize our aircraft during national emergencies when the need for military airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. By participating in this program, we are eligible to bid on and be awarded peacetime airlift contracts with the U.S. military.
Insurance
We carry various types of insurance customary in the airline industry and at amounts deemed adequate to protect us and our property as well as comply with both federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements.
