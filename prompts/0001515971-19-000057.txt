ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Corporate History

We were incorporated as Light Tech, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 24, 1984.  A subsidiary in the name Westcott Products Corporation was organized by us under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24, 1986, for the purpose of changing our name and domicile to the State of Delaware. On June 27, 1986, we merged with the Delaware subsidiary, with the survivor being Westcott Products Corporation, a Delaware corporation. At that time, all of our prior operations were conducted through Lee Building Products and T. A. Kilgore & Company, which owned and operated a home center in League City, Texas, about 30 miles southeast of downtown Houston, Texas. During 1990, we ceased these operations, and the secured lenders took possession our assets.
