Company Overview
Commvault is a leading provider of data protection and information management software applications and related services. Commvault was incorporated in 1996 as a Delaware corporation. The Commvault software platform is an enterprise level, integrated data protection and information management solution, built from the ground up on a single platform and unified code base. All software functionality shares the same back-end technologies to deliver the benefits of a holistic approach to protecting, managing, and accessing data. The software addresses many aspects of data management in the enterprise, while providing scalability and control of data and information. We also provide our customers with a broad range of professional services that are delivered by our worldwide support and field operations.
Commvault software is built upon an innovative single platform architecture. Our software platform is unique and differentiates us from our competitors, some of whom address market needs by offering multiple and disparate point products that have come together as a collection often as a result of acquisition strategies. We believe that the disparate and point product approach forces users to install and maintain separate products requiring their own infrastructure, training, maintenance and management which can result in a complex and costly environment for customers who are looking for a single solution that will improve operations, minimize risk and reduce overall costs.
Commvault software enables customers to simply, and cost effectively, protect and manage their enterprise data throughout its lifecycle, from the mobile worker to the remote office, to the data center, covering the leading operating systems, relational databases, virtualized environments and applications. In addition to addressing today’s data and information management challenges, our customers can realize lower capital costs through more efficient use of their enterprise-wide storage infrastructure assets. This includes the automated movement of data from higher cost to lower cost storage devices, and through sharing and better utilization of storage resources across the enterprise. We can also provide our customers with reduced operating costs through a variety of methods, including fast application deployment, reduced training time, lower cost of storage media consumables, proactive monitoring and analysis, and lower administrative overhead. 
We have established a worldwide, multi-channel distribution network to sell our software and products, and services to large global enterprises, small and medium sized businesses and government agencies, both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our global network of value-added reseller partners, systems integrators, corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturers. As of March 31, 2019, we had licensed our data and information management software to over 28,000 registered customers.

Industry Background
The driving force behind the growth of the data and information management software industry is the rapid growth of data, coupled with the need to reliably protect and quickly access that data, while maintaining the ability to effectively manage the emerging regulations around compliance and e-discovery.
The increasing reliance on critical enterprise software applications such as e-mail, relational databases, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and workgroup collaboration tools is resulting in the rapid growth of data across all enterprises. This data is widely considered to be one of an organization’s most valued and strategic assets. Given the need for actionable and intelligent insights into data sets and file systems, organizations increasingly must scale and store information at unprecedented levels. Big data initiatives leverage new approaches and technologies to store, index and analyze huge data sets, while minimizing storage requirements and driving faster outcomes. 
 Ensuring the security, availability and integrity of the data has become a critical task as regulatory compliance and corporate governance objectives affecting many organizations mandate the creation of multiple copies of data with longer and more complex retention requirements. Government regulations, such as those issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Health 
4

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Government Paper Elimination Act (GPEA), Homeland Security, the Patriot Act, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("The Basel Accords"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, GDPR, as well as company policies requiring data access, protection and preservation, are expanding the proportion of data that must be archived and easily accessible for future use. 
In addition to rapid data growth, data storage has transitioned from being server-attached to becoming widely distributed across local and global networked storage systems. Data previously stored on primary disk and backed up on tape is increasingly being backed up, managed and stored on a broader array of storage tiers ranging from high-cost, high-performance disk systems, to lower-cost mid-range and low-end disk systems, to tape libraries and both public and private cloud storage services. This transition has been driven by the growth of data, the pervasive use of distributed critical enterprise software applications, the decrease in disk cost, and the demand for 24/7 business continuity.
The innovations in storage and networking technologies, coupled with the rapid growth of data, have caused information technology managers to redesign their data and storage infrastructures to deliver greater efficiency, broaden access to data and reduce costs. The result has been the wide adoption of virtualized environments with larger and more complex networked data and storage solutions. We also believe the cloud will continue to significantly impact the way that applications are delivered, data is stored and information is retrieved.
The rapid growth of data and the need to securely protect, manage and access this data is driving substantial opportunities for managed service providers ("MSPs") to help organizations deploy and manage solutions that deliver data management capabilities. The result is reduced long-term management costs with increased offerings to customers, which we believe represents a long-term industry trend in the way that services are offered.
We believe that these trends are increasing the demand for software applications that can simplify data and information management, provide secure and reliable access to all data across a broad spectrum of tiered storage and computing systems and seamlessly scale to accommodate growth, while reducing the total cost of ownership to the customer.
Our Software and Products
Historically, the vast majority of our software licenses provided for a perpetual right to use our software and are sold on a per terabyte capacity basis, as site licenses or via instance based packaging. In recent years, most of our software and products revenue has been sold on a capacity basis. Software licenses sold on a capacity basis provide the customer with unlimited install licenses of specified software products based on a defined level of terabytes of data under management. As a result, when we sell our software via a capacity license, certain of the various functionalities discussed below are bundled into one capacity based price. In addition to terabyte based capacity pricing, we also offer our customers instance based licensing. We primarily sell instance based licenses for virtual machine backup, recovery and cloud management, endpoint data protection, and email archive. These instance based licenses also include various functionalities bundled into one capacity based price.
Prior to fiscal 2018, an insignificant amount of our revenue was sold under subscription, or term-based, license arrangements. Any of our licensing models (capacity, instance, etc.) can be sold via a subscription arrangement.  In these arrangements the customer has the right to use the software over a designated period of time. The capacity of the license is fixed and the customer has made an unconditional commitment to pay. Software revenue in these arrangements is generally recognized when the software is delivered. In fiscal 2018, we started to introduce more subscription arrangements into the market. We expect revenue from these types of arrangements as a percentage of our total revenue to increase in the next few years. We also sell to some customers, primarily managed service providers, via utility, or pay-as-you-go models. In these arrangements actual usage is regularly measured and billed. Revenue in these utility arrangements is recognized as the software is used. 
Commvault Software Solutions
The Commvault software suite contains solutions that are all built on a single unified code base and platform to protect, manage and access data and information. Within the platform, tightly integrated, powerful software features deliver functionality throughout physical and virtual environments to help protect and recover data, manage costs and complexity and gain better insight into information. 
In fiscal 2019, we simplified our product set to bring together comprehensive backup and recovery and data management, including storage infrastructure, service delivery orchestration and data governance. The new packaging portfolio is suited to address the rapidly evolving business needs of today's digital organizations, helping to make managing backup simple. Commvault’s newly-packaged product set combines new innovations and capabilities into four primary products:

Fully managed by Commvault in the cloud with 24/7 customer support, Commvault Endpoint Data Protection as a Service eliminates the need for in-house infrastructure installation and reduces application management resources. We anticipate expanding Commvault Software-as-a-Service to additional use cases in the future. 

Strategic Relationships
An important element of Commvault’s strategy is to establish relationships with third parties that assist us in developing, marketing, selling and implementing our software and services. We believe that strategic and technology-based relationships with industry leaders are fundamental to our success. We have forged numerous relationships with software application and hardware vendors to enhance our combined capabilities and to create the optimal combination of data and information management applications. This approach enhances our ability to expand our product offerings and customer base and to enter new markets. We have established the following types of strategic relationships:
Technology Alliance Partners.    We maintain strategic product and technology relationships with major industry leaders to ensure that our software applications are integrated with, supported by and add value to our partners’ hardware and software products. Collaboration with these market leaders allows us to provide applications that enable our customers to improve data and information management efficiency. Our significant strategic relationships include Atos, Cisco, Citrix, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and VMware. In addition to these relationships, we maintain relationships with a broad range of industry operating system, application and infrastructure vendors to verify and demonstrate the interoperability of our software applications with their equipment and technologies.
Distributors, Value-Added Reseller, Systems Integrator, Corporate Reseller and Original Equipment Manufacturer Relationships.    Our corporate resellers bundle or sell our software applications together with their own products, and our 
7

value-added resellers resell our software applications independently. As of March 31, 2019, we had more than 500 reseller partners and systems integrators that have distributed our software worldwide.
In order to broaden our market coverage, we work closely with our Global Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Partners, investing significant time and resources to deliver unique, joint solutions incorporating Commvault software. These partners team with our technical, engineering, marketing and sales force on helping to enhance integration, tuning, operational management, implementation and vision for solutions that are designed to meet current and future data and information management needs. Our alliance managers work directly with Global OEM Partners to design, deliver and support field activities that make it easier for customers to locate, learn about, and purchase these differentiated solutions. Our most significant OEM partner is Hitachi Vantara (Hitachi). Hitachi has no obligation to recommend or offer our software applications exclusively or at all, and they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time. Sales through our original equipment manufacturer agreements, accounted for 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 and 12% of our total revenues for fiscal 2018. 
Additionally, we have a non-exclusive distribution agreements covering our North American commercial markets and our U.S. Federal Government markets with Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions, Inc. (Arrow), a subsidiary of Arrow Electronics, Inc. Pursuant to these distribution agreements, Arrow's primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience. Sales generated through our distribution agreement with Arrow accounted for approximately 38% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019 and 36% of our total revenue in fiscal 2018.
Service Provider Partners. Our software is the data protection platform for over 200 service providers, which provide cloud-based solutions to client systems worldwide. As companies of all sizes and markets rapidly adopt cloud infrastructures for improved costs, speed and agility, we remain committed to these strategic relationships to address this growing trend.  Customers looking to move IT operations into the cloud depend on service providers to help them migrate, manage and protect their cloud infrastructures. We have partnered with a broad ecosystem of managed service provider and cloud partners so they can effectively deliver data management-as-a-service solutions based on Commvault software across geographies, vertical markets and offerings. Leading providers who have integrated Commvault software into their solution portfolios include Microsoft Windows Azure, AWS, Dimension Data, NetApp, and Rackspace.
Customers
We sell Commvault software applications and related services directly to large global enterprises, small and medium sized businesses and government agencies, and indirectly through value-added resellers, systems integrators, corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturer partners. As of March 31, 2019, we had licensed our software applications to over 28,000 registered customers in a broad range of industries, including banking, insurance and financial services, government, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical services, technology, legal, manufacturing, utilities and energy. 
Technology
We believe our software platform serves as a major differentiator versus our competitors’ data and information management software products. Our platform’s unique indexing, cataloging, data movement, media management and policy technologies are the source of the performance, scale, management, cost of ownership benefits and seamless interoperability inherent in all of our data and information management software applications. Additional options enable content search, data encryption and auditing features to support data discovery and compliance requirements. Each of these solutions share a common architecture consisting of three core components: intelligent agent software, data movement software and command and control software. These components may be installed on a single host server, or each may be distributed over many servers in a global network. Additionally, the modularity of our software provides deployment flexibility. The ability to share storage resources across multiple data and information management applications provides easier data and information management and lower total cost of ownership. We participate in industry standards groups and activities that we believe will have a direct bearing on the data and information management software market.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our data and information management software applications and related services to large global enterprises, small and medium sized businesses, and government agencies. We sell through our worldwide direct sales force and our global network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturer partners. As of March 31, 2019, we had 778 employees in sales and marketing. These employees are primarily located in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.

We have a variety of marketing programs designed to create brand awareness and market recognition for our product offerings and for sales lead generation. Our marketing efforts include our annual customer conference (Commvault GO), active participation at trade shows, technical conferences and technology seminars; advertising; content development and distribution; public relations; social media; industry analyst relations; publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals; sales training; and preparation of competitive analyses. In addition, our strategic partners augment our marketing and sales campaigns through seminars, trade shows and joint public relations and advertising campaigns. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in external marketing activities.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our data and information management software applications. As of March 31, 2019, we had 604 employees in our research and development group, of which 230 are located in our Hyderabad and Bangalore development centers in India. Our engineering efforts support product development across all major operating systems, databases, applications and network storage devices. A substantial amount of our development effort goes into certification, integration and support of our applications to ensure interoperability with our strategic partners’ hardware and software products. We have also made substantial investments in the automation of our product test and quality assurance laboratories. We spent $92.6 million on research and development activities in fiscal 2019 and $91.0 million in fiscal 2018. 
Competition
The data storage management market is intensely competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. We currently compete with other providers of data and information management software as well as large and emerging storage hardware manufacturers that have developed or acquired their own data and information management software products. These manufacturers have the resources and capabilities to develop their own data and information management software applications, and many have been making acquisitions and broadening their efforts to include broader data and information management and storage products. These manufacturers and/or our other current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, creating new competitors or alliances. Large operating system and application vendors have introduced products or functionality that includes some of the same functions offered by our software applications. In the future, further development by these vendors could cause some features of our software applications to become redundant.
Our primary competitors in the data and information management software applications market, each of which has one or more products that compete with a part of or our entire software suite, are Dell EMC, IBM, Veritas, Veeam, Rubrik and Cohesity. 
The principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality, product performance, product integration, platform coverage, ability to scale, price, worldwide sales infrastructure, global technical support, name recognition and reputation. The ability of major system vendors to bundle hardware and software solutions is also a significant competitive factor in our industry. Although some of our competitors have greater resources, a larger installed customer base and greater name recognition, we believe we compete favorably on the basis of these competitive factors.
Our unique product architecture is one of the primary reasons why we compete so successfully. Whereas other competitive solutions in the market are based on multiple, disparate products, our modular offering is based on a single, unified, underlying code base resulting in favorable efficiencies in functionality, integration, scalability and support. Our focused approach to data and information management and our ability to respond to customer feedback also drives the functionality and features of our products, which we believe lead the industry in terms of performance and usability, as evidenced by numerous industry awards we have received.
From a customer perspective, highly integrated products such as ours, which are based on a single, unified, underlying code base, are easier and less expensive to deploy, operate and manage. This flexibility, in turn, makes it significantly easier to scale our products over a customer’s entire IT environment. Supporting and enhancing our products is made more efficient due to this single, unified, underlying code base, unlike our competitors who are required to support and enhance multiple, disparate products, most of which are based on differing underlying software code. Supporting multiple, disparate products places more onerous and costly demands on our competitors’ internal human and operational capital. We believe that Commvault software, because of its unique architecture, creates a compelling functional, integration, scalability and support advantage. We continue to expand our worldwide sales infrastructure and increase our distribution throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia and Asia to meet the needs of our business.

Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may have the ability to offer their products at lower prices than ours. In addition, some of our competitors have greater name recognition than us, which could provide them a competitive advantage with some customers. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, have substantially greater technical, sales, marketing and other global resources than we do, as well as a larger installed customer base and broader product offerings, including hardware. As a result, these competitors can devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products than we can.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our success and ability to compete depend on our continued development and protection of our proprietary software and other technologies. We rely primarily on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We provide our software to customers pursuant to license agreements that impose certain restrictions on use. These license agreements are primarily in the form of shrink-wrap or click-wrap licenses, which are not negotiated with or signed by our end-user customers. These measures may afford only limited protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights associated with our software. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants involved in product development. We routinely require our employees, customers and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our software, technology or business plans.
As of March 31, 2019, we had 666 issued patents and 338 pending patent applications in the United States, as well as 88 issued patents in foreign countries and 23 pending foreign patent applications. No single patent, copyright, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products or services. Moreover, we may lack adequate patent or other intellectual property protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important to our business.  Pending patent applications may receive unfavorable examination and are not guaranteed allowance as issued patents. We may elect to abandon or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications due to patent examination results, economic considerations, strategic concerns or other factors. We will continue to assess appropriate occasions to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for innovative aspects of our technology that we believe provide us a significant competitive advantage.
Changes to patent laws or regulations in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions, or new interpretations of these laws and regulations, could also diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, changes in patent laws and regulations in the U.S. and new patent laws in Europe may affect the ability of companies, including Commvault, to protect innovations, bring patent infringement claims, and defend against claims of patent infringement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future.
Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through patents and license and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations but effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business could be negatively impacted.
We currently resell certain software from Microsoft, including Microsoft SQL Server, used in conjunction with our software applications pursuant to an independent software vendor royalty license and distribution agreement that we have and plan to continue renewing annually. We have also entered into and may enter into agreements with additional third parties, including RedHat, to license their technology for use with our software applications. 
Some of the products or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called “open source” software and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. The use of such open source software may ultimately subject some products to unintended conditions, such as royalty-free licensing of proprietary portions of our products, disclosing proprietary parts of our source code, or commencing costly product redesigns that could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, product performance degradation, or a delay in shipping products to customers, and which may negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and ability to commercialize our products or technologies.
From time to time, we are participants or members of various industry standard-setting organizations or other industry technical organizations. Our participation or membership in such organizations may, in some circumstances, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties regarding our intellectual property under terms established by those organizations, which we may find unfavorable.
