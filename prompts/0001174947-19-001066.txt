--------+---------

General
 Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp. (“Espey”) is a power electronics design and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) company with a long history of developing and delivering highly reliable products for use in military and severe environment applications. Design, manufacturing, and testing is performed in our 150,000+ square foot facility located at 233 Ballston Ave, Saratoga Springs, New York. Espey is classified as a “smaller reporting company” for purposes of the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Espey’s common stock is publicly-traded on the NYSE American under the symbol “ESP.”
 Espey began operations after incorporation in New York in 1928. We strive to remain competitive as a leader in high power energy conversion and transformer solutions through the design and manufacture of new and improved products by using advanced and “cutting edge” electronics technologies.
 Espey is ISO 9001:2015 and AS9100:2016 certified. Our primary products are power supplies, power converters, filters, power transformers, magnetic components, power distribution equipment, UPS systems, antennas and high power radar systems. The applications of these products include AC and DC locomotives, shipboard power, shipboard radar, airborne power, ground-based radar, and ground mobile power.
 Espey’s services include design and development to specification, build to print, design services, design studies, environmental testing services, metal fabrication, painting services, and development of automatic testing equipment. Espey is vertically integrated, meaning that the Company produces individual components (including inductors), populates printed circuit boards, fabricates metalwork, paints, wires, qualifies, and fully tests items, mechanically, electrically and environmentally, in house. Portions of the manufacturing and testing process are subcontracted to vendors from time to time.
 In fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company's total sales were $36,477,851 and $32,517,883, respectively. Sales to three domestic customers accounted for 34%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of total sales in 2019. Sales to two domestic customers accounted for 33% and 27% of total sales in 2018. This high concentration level with these customers presents significant risk. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the financial performance of the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year.
 Export sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were approximately $2,638,000 and $3,112,000, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in antenna shipments.
 Sources of Raw Materials
 The Company has not typically experienced any significant delays or shortages with respect to the purchase of raw materials and components used in the manufacture of its products and has at least two potential sources of supply for a majority of its raw materials. However, certain components used in its products are available from a single or a limited number of sources. Despite the risk associated with single or limited source suppliers, the benefits of higher quality goods and timely delivery minimize and often limit any potential risk and can eliminate problems with part failures during production. At times replacements are required to cover obsolete parts.
 The power electronics industry is experiencing sustained growth and continuing demand from multiple manufacturing sectors. This growth has created volatility and unpredictability in the availability of certain electronic components and, in some cases, has created industry shortages. These shortages have a strong potential to impact our ability to support our customer’s schedule demands, as lead times for these components have, in some instances, increased from readily available to waiting times of nearly a year or more. We are working with our customers to mitigate adverse impact upon our ability to service their requirements resulting from the current industry-wide phenomenon.
 The President of the United States continued the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from various countries in 2019. While currently we are not experiencing any significant financial or raw material sourcing issues resulting from the product tariffs, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the existing tariffs, the potential of additional tariffs, and the associated volatility arising from the Administration’s foreign trade policies, will not have a negative impact on our future earnings by increasing our raw material prices and augmenting the lead time for the availability of raw materials. From time to time the Company must identify parts to replace parts which are no longer produced.

Sales Backlog
 The total backlog at June 30, 2019 was approximately $45.6 million compared to approximately $48.1 million at June 30, 2018. The Company’s total backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog at June 30, 2019 is approximately $42.9 million. This includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by Congress and/or funded by the customer. The unfunded backlog at June 30, 2019 is approximately $2.7 million and represents a firm multi-year order for which funding has not yet been appropriated by Congress or funded by our customer. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for individual programs, management has included in unfunded backlog only those programs that it believes are likely to receive funding based on discussions with customers and program status. The unfunded backlog at June 30, 2018 was $3.1 million. For both fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018, the unfunded backlog is comprised primarily of the same multi-year order from a single customer. The Company's backlog and risks associated with government contracts is discussed in greater detail below.
 
It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $32.7 million of orders comprising the June 30, 2019 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. The minimum of $32.7 million does not include any shipments which may be made against orders received subsequently to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The estimate of the June 30, 2019 backlog to be shipped in fiscal year 2020 is subject to future events, which may cause the amount of the backlog actually shipped to differ from such estimate.
 Marketing and Competition
 The Company markets its products primarily through its own direct sales organization and through outside sales representatives. Business is solicited from large industrial manufacturers and defense companies, the government of the United States, foreign governments and major foreign electronic equipment companies. Espey is also on the eligible list of contractors with the United States Department of Defense. We pursue opportunities for prime contracts directly with the Department of Defense and are generally automatically solicited by Department of Defense procurement agencies for their needs falling within the major classes of products produced by the Company. Espey contracts with the Federal Government under cage code 20950 as Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp.
 There is competition in all classes of products manufactured by the Company ranging from divisions of the largest electronic companies, to many small companies. The Company's sales do not represent a significant share of the industry's market for any class of its products. The principal methods of competition for electronic products of both a military and industrial nature include, among other factors, price, product performance, the experience of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products.
 Our business is not seasonal. However, the concentration of our business in the rail industry, and in equipment for military applications and industrial applications and our customer concentrations expose us to on-going associated risks. These risks include, without limitation, requirements for power supplies in the rail industry, dependence on appropriations from the United States Government and the governments of foreign nations, program allocations, the potential of governmental termination of orders for convenience, and the general strength of the industry sectors in which our customers transact business.
 Future procurement needs supporting the military and the rail industry continues to drive competition. Many of our competitors have, and they continue to invest aggressively in upfront product design costs and accept lower profit margins as a strategic means of maintaining existing business and enhancing market share. This continues to put pressure on the pricing of our current products and has lowered our profit margins on some of our new business. In order to compete effectively for new business, in some cases we have invested in upfront design costs, thereby reducing initial profitability as a means of procuring new long-term programs. As part of our strategy, we adjust our pricing in order to achieve a balance which enables us both to retain repeat programs while being more competitive in bidding on new programs.
 
We continue to place an emphasis on securing “build to print” opportunities, which allows production work to go directly to the manufacturing floor, limiting the impact on our engineering staff. This allows us to keep our manufacturing team busy while the products being developed in-house transition to production.
 
Research and Development
 
Some of the Company's engineers and technicians spend varying amounts of time on either the development of new products or improvements to existing products. A majority of the resulting costs we incur relate to research that is required to support a request for quotation from a customer product-specific need usually associated with stringent size and weight requirements. We do very little pure research as our business primarily is driven by customer product needs and custom product development with some customer funding. The Company's expenditures for research and development were approximately $44,819 and $18,206 in fiscal year 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Employees
 The Company had 160 employees as of August 31, 2019. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we increased the number of employees to support our business growth. Approximately 40% of the employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. A new collective bargaining agreement was approved in July 2018. The four-year agreement expires on June 30, 2022. Relations with the Union are considered good.
 Government Regulations
 Compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, did not in fiscal year 2019, and the Company believes will not in fiscal year 2020, have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, net income, or competitive position of the Company.
 The Company’s U.S. Government contract and subcontract orders are funded by government budgets, which operate on an October-to-September fiscal year. Normally, in February of each year, the President of the United States presents to Congress a proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This budget includes recommended appropriations for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. From February through September of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of Congress review the President’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year in appropriations and authorization legislation. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies.
 There are two primary risks associated with this process. First, the process may be delayed or disrupted because of congressional schedules, negotiations over funding levels for programs or unforeseen world events, which could, in turn, alter the funding for a program or contract. Second, funding for multi-year contracts can be changed by future appropriations, which could affect the timing of funds, schedules and program content.
 Also, our international sales are denominated in United States dollars. Consequently, a strengthening of the United States dollar against foreign currencies could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors’ products.
 U.S. Government Defense Contracts and Subcontracts
 Generally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. Some of the Company’s contracts are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which lays out uniform policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services by the U.S. Government, and agency-specific acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR. For example, the Department of Defense implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (DFAR).
 
The FAR also contains guidelines and regulations for managing a contract after award, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience or for default. If a contract is terminated for the convenience of the government, a contractor is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work done. If a contract is terminated for default, the government generally pays for only the work it has accepted. These regulations also subject the Company to financial audits and other reviews by the government of its costs, performance, accounting and general business practices relating to its contracts, which may result in adjustment of the Company’s contract-related costs and fees.
 
Cyber or Other Security Threats or Other Disruptions
 
We routinely experience cybersecurity threats in the form of unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced attacks with the specific objective of accessing national security information. We believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are above adequate. The processes and procedures in place are designed to detect, manage and prevent current threats and respond quickly to detect and mitigate new threats. To ensure our systems remain protected, we continually assess and acquire, as appropriate, new available technology and provide employee training to utilize effectively our technological assets. Prior cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results nor restricted us from being awarded contracts from other defense companies or directly from the United States Department of Defense. However, we can provide no assurance that the occurrence of any future event would not adversely affect our internal operations, our reputation and competitive advantage, and our future financial results.
