ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Hillstream BioPharma is a pre-clinical biotechnology company developing novel therapeutic candidates targeting ferroptosis, an emerging new anti-cancer mechanism resulting in iron mediated cell death (“IMCD”), and targeted immuno-oncology novel biologics, for the treatment drug resistant cancers. Our most advanced product candidate, HSB-1216, is an IMCD inducer, targeting a variety of solid tumors. In a clinical pilot study conducted at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, the active drug in HSB-1216 was found to reduce tumor burden in treatment resistant cancers, including triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”) and epithelial carcinomas. We utilize Quatramer™, our proprietary tumor targeting platform, to enhance the uptake of HSB-1216 in the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) with an extended duration of action and minimal off-target toxicity. Our goal is to submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and initiate a clinical study with HSB-1216 in the second half of 2023; however, no assurance can be provided that our IND will be accepted by the FDA in 2023, if at all. If our IND is accepted by the FDA, our HSB-1216 clinical studies will focus on expanding upon the clinical pilot study conducted in Germany. If we are able to initiate our clinical study with HSB-1216 in the second half of 2023, we anticipate that clinical data from such trial will be released either late 2024 or early 2025.
 
The discovery of regulated cell death processes, such as apoptosis and autophagy, has enabled novel target discovery for drug development. Ferroptosis, a form of IMCD, is an emerging regulated cell death process which decreases intracellular iron or the Labile Iron Pool (“LIP”), a known factor required for cell growth. Cancer cells promote increase in the LIP leading to unregulated cell growth and metabolism. Decreasing the LIP, induces iron-led reactive-oxygen species (“ROS”) production and lipid peroxidation, two key hallmarks of ferroptosis/IMCD, which lead to regulated cell death. HSB-1216 sequesters iron in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and decreases the LIP, thereby inducing ferroptosis/IMCD, leading to regulated cell death. Areas of interest for the development of HSB-1216 are as a treatment of solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”), TNBC, uveal melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and other drug resistant cancers with high unmet need.
 
Quatramer is a tumor targeting platform which allows us to leverage and exploit key tumor targets and novel emerging pathways such as IMCD to facilitate the delivery of potent drugs directly to the TME while sparing healthy tissue. By efficiently extending the circulation half-life, as well as targeting delivery to the tumor site, Quatramer preferentially traps drugs in the TME. This emerging orthogonal anti-cancer approach leverages a fundamental recognized mechanism of iron mediated tumor growth and metabolism. We are building a portfolio of long-acting, potent anti-cancer drug candidates using our Quatramer platform.

The Quatrabody™ provides an entry into development of next generation immune-oncology (“IO”) biologics including, bispecific and trispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”), CAR-T, CAR-NKs among others. Quatrabodies capitalize on the long half-life of tumor targeting Quatramers combined with Picobodies™ bovine-derived antibody “knob” domains which have potential to access and bind more tightly to “undruggable” epitopes better than full sized antibodies. HSB-1940 is a combination of programed cell death protein 1 (“PD-1”) targeting Picobodies bound to the surface of Quatramers. Quatrabodies have the potential for delivering an increased drug payload to the tumor with a longer half-life while targeting novel “undruggable” epitopes of well-established and validated IO targets such as PD-1.
 
Our Product Candidates and Research Programs
 
We are leveraging our proprietary technologies and developing multiple product candidates with differentiated profiles designed to address rare and treatment resistant cancers, as shown below.
 
Figure 1: Pipeline Chart
 

We intend to submit INDs to the FDA to gain approval to initiate clinical studies in the second half of 2023 for HSB-1216 and in 2025 for both HSB-3215 and HSB-1940; however, no assurance can be provided that our INDs will be accepted by the FDA based on our anticipated timeline, if at all.
Our Lead Candidates
 
HSB-1216
 
HSB-1216, our most advanced product candidate which we intend to prepare for advancement into the clinic for multiple high unmet need solid tumors, is an IMCD inducer delivered using the Quatramer, our proprietary tumor targeting platform. We intend to submit an IND application to the FDA and obtain clinical data to support our strategy in the second half of 2023; however, no assurance can be provided that our IND will be accepted by the FDA in 2023, if at all. HSB-1216 exploits a key feature of certain tumors that rely on an excessive LIP inside the cell to modify the dysregulated iron microenvironment of cancer. We have received orphan drug designation (“ODD”) in SCLC and uveal melanoma for HSB-1216’s active drug. In a clinical pilot study conducted at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, HSB-1216’s active drug was studied in seven patients with positive results in heavily pre-treated and therapy resistant cancers. By design, HSB-1216 circulates systemically after an intravenous injection and concentrates in the TME of solid tumor masses. The localization of HSB-1216 has been demonstrated in multiple in vivo pre-clinical models with pharmacodynamic signals showing significant decreases in tumor size after weekly injections over time.

Figure 2: How Drug-resistant Persister Cancer Cells, Using Ferroptosis/IMCD, Hijack Intracellular Iron for Unregulated Growth and the Potential Role of HSB-1216
 

HSB-1216’s ability to target drug-resistant persister cancer cells has the potential to be used in cancer patients who have failed standard-of-care for treatment resistant tumors without any approved therapies. We intend to submit an IND to the FDA for approval in the second half of 2023 and, if such IND is timely submitted and approved, we anticipate clinical data either late 2024 or early 2025; however, no assurance can be provided that our IND will be accepted by the FDA in 2023, if at all.
 
HSB-3215
 
HSB-3215, our second product candidate, is an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody candidate. The ErbB or HER family of cell surface proteins are some of the most well-known and validated oncology drug targets including ErbB2 or HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor) and Erb3 or HER3. The family of antibodies and biologics against HER2 starting with HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab) approved in 1998 for breast cancer, one of the first few anti-cancer antibodies, as well as PERJETA® (pertuzumab), KADCYLA® (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) and PHESGO® (Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase) reported 2022 sales of greater than $8 billion for Roche/Genentech. Antibodies against HER2 and HER3 bind to different domains of the extracellular portion of the proteins or epitopes with trastuzumab primarily binding the extracellular domain IV of HER2. HER2 is a validated tumor antigen for antibody drug conjugates to treat HER2 positive cancers with two approved antibodies, Roche/Genentech’s KADCYLA® and Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU®.
 
Applied Biomedical Science Institute (“ABSI”) has developed technology to target unique functional epitopes of the cancer targets HER2 and HER3. Monoclonal antibodies being developed at ABSI are unique from the currently approved anti-HER2 antibodies. ABSI has granted us an exclusive option to license technology from ABSI to develop HER2 and HER3 antibodies, including multi-specific and Quatramer- based therapeutics incorporating portions of the antibodies. These antibodies could be incorporated into proprietary multi-format biologics (bi- and tri-specific antibodies, ADCs (antibody drug conjugates), CAR-T and CAR-NKs, in Quatramers and Quatrabodies) against drug resistant cancers including HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer. The ABSI option terminates on March 24, 2023, unless extended by the parties.

HSB-1940
 
Our third product candidate, HSB-1940, is a Quatrabody, a proprietary IO biologic, in development targeting PD-1. We entered into a research collaboration and product license agreement with Minotaur Therapeutics, Inc. (“Minotaur”) and a commercial license agreement with Taurus Biosciences, LLC (“Taurus”), for use of certain technology, including OmniAb antibodies, to advance Picobodies™ against novel, undruggable epitopes in high-value validated IO targets starting with PD-1.
 
The technologies of Hillstream and Minotaur will be combined under the license from Taurus to discover, develop and advance biotherapeutics against high-value validated IO targets. Picobodies are bovine-derived antibody “knob” domains comprised of cysteine-rich ultralong complementary determining region (“CDR”) H3 sequences of 30-40 amino acids weighing ~3-4 KDa, which have the potential to access challenging undruggable epitopes better than full size antibodies can.
 
By combining Quatramers, with their long half-life, coated with a PD-1 Picobody to create HSB-1940, we believe we can more efficiently target novel epitopes with greater binding affinity than approved anti-PD-1 antibodies. We further believe that the development of HSB-1940 is a step toward enabling us to enter the rapidly growing IO market with additional targets thereafter.
 
Our Other Product Candidates
 
We intend to further develop our pipeline with novel bispecific monoclonal antibodies. These bispecific antibodies are planned to simultaneously bind to two different antigens or to two different epitopes on the same antigen. Whether two different antigens or two epitopes on the same antigen, the bispecific antibody could bind its targets either on the same cell (cis) or on to different cells (trans). Our strategy involves targeting PD-1 combined with a known, validated undisclosed antigen (HSB-9646) or using HER2 instead of PD-1 (HSB-0059), while naturally occurring antibodies typically only target one epitope on one antigen. At this time, we have de-prioritized the expenditures and related activities associated with TridentAI, HSB-510, HSB-114 and HSB-888.
Research Programs
 
Our technology platform enables us to generate a pipeline of early-stage product candidates spanning multiple targets in oncology utilizing diverse payloads to treat rare and treatment resistant tumors. While the payload in our most advanced product candidate, HSB-1216, is novel, and has pilot human data in multiple solid tumors, any solid tumor or non-oncologic disease requiring delivery of a peptide, protein or biologic is conceivably a candidate for our Quatramer technology. Our early-stage product candidates such as HSB-3215 and HSB-1940 are focused on rare and treatment resistant diseases; however, we believe our technology could potentially deliver meaningful benefit across a wide range of oncologic and viral diseases. We have tested several peptides, nucleic acids, proteins, small molecules and antibody constructs against multiple targets.

Our Platform Technologies
 
Quatramer Technology
 
A key aspect of oncology treatment is that effective anticancer agents do not penetrate the tumor bed in order to kill cancer cells due to the limitation of the microenvironment of the tumor. The TME is protected by stromal tissue comprised of multiple layers of collagen, proteoglycans, hyaluronans and laminin layers shielding the tumor from the deployment of traditional treatments, including chemotherapy (novel small molecule and immunotherapies). Parts of the tumor create an environment to survive despite reduced nutrient sources whereby hypoxic regions of the tumor continue to thrive by incorporating a shift in metabolism, including iron dysregulation. Any drug that reaches the tumor is effluxed out of the cell by transporter pumps upregulated by the cancer cells rendering any such drug that reaches the tumor ineffective. The TME continues to thrive by the inability of immune cells normally designed to infiltrate and kill the tumor made ineffective by a reduction in their ability to activate their killing effect of the cancer.

Our proprietary Quatramer technology overcomes the limitations that have hampered development of nanoscale and liposome derived products as cancer therapeutics. Limitations include, but are not limited to, drug efflux, toxicity, eluding phagocytosis, physiological barrier penetrance and immune responses. Our Quatramer technology incorporates a therapeutic payload and is designed to be tunable while having a prolonged circulation within the blood, allowing a targeting of diseased tissue or cells, while providing a controlled and timely release of the therapeutic payload.
 
Characteristics of our Quatramer technology include:
 

● | Prolonged circulation: the stealth nature of Quatramer allows for a prolonged circulation time resulting in accumulation at the site of disease prior to being cleared. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Targeted: the size, shape and surface of Quatramer allows it to escape via gaps in the blood vessels in the TME allowing for release of the payload directly into cancerous cells. 
● | Blocks drug efflux: Quatramer composition offers reversal of p-glycoprotein mediated drug resistance in cells via generation of poloxamers (breakdown products comprised of small co-polymers). 
● | Tunability: Quatramer physicochemical characterization allows for optimizing size, shape and surface chemistry based on payload characteristics to render enhanced permeation and retention into the TME. 
● | Ease of manufacturing: large scale production efficiency and analysis for uniform chemistry, manufacturing and control capability at lower costs. 
● | Established regulatory path: chemical compositions listed in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database with known profile. 
● | Payload versatility and flexibility: combined with the tunability of Quatramer, the technology allows for a variety of delivery payloads including peptides, small molecules, nucleic acids and antibodies with the added flexibility of dual-loaded payload therapeutics. 
● | Biodegradable: Quatramers ultimately breakdown into known metabolites such as lactic acid and ethanol. 

Quatrabody Technology
 
Quatrabodies combine the benefits of tumor targeting and long half-life of Quatramers with novel Picobodies to enter into development of next generation IO therapeutics. Quatrabodies capitalize on the knob domains from bovine-derived antibodies which have the potential to access “undruggable” epitopes on validated tumor targets better than full sized antibodies. Picobodies are the smallest known antibody fragment, comprised of ultra-long CDR H3 sequences of 30-40 amino acids rich with cysteines that create tightly folded structures capable of binding recessed epitopes.

--

Figure 4: Quatrabodies Combine Quatramers’ Tumor Targeting and Long Half-Life with Knobs, the Smallest Known Antibody Fragments, Targeting Undruggable Epitopes
 

Antibodies derived from mouse or human sources use the surface formed by CDRs on the variable regions of the heavy chain/light chain heterodimer, which typically forms a relatively flat binding surface. Bovine’s ultralong CDR-H3 regions form an independently folding mini-domain, which protrudes far out from the surface of the antibody and forms a “stalk and knob” structure which is diverse in both its sequence and disulfide patterns. The “knob” (Picobody) component can be expressed as an independent antigen binding domain. At ~4-6 kDa, these are three times smaller than a camelid “nanobody” and are the smallest known antibody fragment. These atypical antigen binding sites of bovines potentially provide the ability to interact with different antigenic determinants, particularly recessed or concave surfaces, compared to traditional antibodies.

Our Key Programs: HSB-1216, HSB-3215 and HSB-1940
 
We have leveraged our proprietary technologies and are developing multiple product candidates with differentiated profiles designed to address rare and treatment resistant cancers. Our HSB-1216 product candidate is an IMCD inducer delivered by our proprietary Quatramer platform. We intend to submit an IND to the FDA to gain approval to initiate clinical studies in the second half of 2023 and, if such IND is timely submitted and approved, we anticipate initial data will be released either late 2024 or early 2025; however, no assurance can be provided that our IND will be accepted by the FDA in 2023, if at all. We intend to submit an IND for HSB-3215 (anti-HER2 antibody with novel conformational epitopes) and HSB-1940 (our first Quatrabody targeting PD-1), subject to successfully completing pre-clinical identification and characterization as well as IND enabling studies in 2024.
HSB-1216: Our Novel Iron-Medicated Cell Death Inducer
 
Iron, an important factor of many organisms, satisfies an assortment of vital living processes including DNA replication, protein synthesis and cellular respiration, essential for normal growth and propagation. However, iron also produces ROS via a chemical process in which there is a catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by ferrous ions, known as the Fenton reaction. This process may cause damage to the membrane lipid and DNA caused by ROS, known as lysosomal membrane permeabilization (“LMP”) rupturing and killing the cell by spilling its contents into the surrounding microenvironment and causing degradation in the surrounding extracellular milieu. Emerging evidence suggests iron may have a twofold role on cells, both stimulating cell growth and causing cell death, particularly a new form named ferroptosis, first described by the accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides.
 
Figure 5: Role of Iron in Growth of Drug-Resistant Persister Cancer Cells and Mechanism of Action of HSB-1216
 

Research that has been published by us with respect to the active drug of HSB-1216 targeting chemotherapy resistant tumors suggests that it sequesters iron in the lysosomes of resistant tumor cells causing LMP of hard-to-treat cancer cells known as persister cells causing them to rupture and stop replicating. We believe an area of high interest for the development of HSB-1216 could be SCLC or TNBC or other rare cancers with high unmet need.

Figure 6: HSB-1216 – Ferroptosis/IMCD Mechanism of Action: Shifting the Intracellular Redox Balance 
 

One of the standard limitations to achieving successful cancer therapies is the manifestation of multidrug resistance (“MDR”) which is a cross-resistance to many commonly used drugs after repeat dosing. Extensive evidence to this point has shown that the mechanisms related to tumor MDR are complex and there is an urgent need to decipher the nuances of this phenomenon and discover new agents capable of evading resistance which can be applied to a clinical strategy in cancer. MDR can be developed by various ATP-binding cassette (“ABC”) transporters, including the well characterized ABCB1, also known as p-glycoprotein, which has been shown to be an important protein of the cell membrane and can transport a variety of molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. The protein is an adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”) dependent drug efflux pump that transports foreign substances out of the cell including drugs and xenobiotics with broad substrate specificity. HSB-1216’s active drug has been shown to block this ABC transporter in numerous studies as evidenced by drug efflux assays in MDR cell lines overexpressing these proteins by inducing a conformational change on the transporter protein itself rendering it ineffective. Furthermore, the byproduct of the Quatramer bio-degradable process results in formation of poloxamers which blocks the p-glycoprotein transporter system. This evidence may also allow other traditional chemotherapies, such as paclitaxel which is highly effected by these transporters, to stay in the cell and elicit anti-tumor effects in combination with HSB-1216.

HSB-1216 in Oncology Indications
 
Our drug candidate, HSB-1216, has novel characteristics which may benefit patients with hard-to-treat recurrent tumors, such as TNBC in a number of ways. HSB-1216’s active drug, traditionally used as an anti-coccidial drug in livestock and poultry, has been shown to possess anti-cancer effects in a chemical screen on the basis that it has more than 100-fold potency compared to paclitaxel, a commonly used FDA-approved anti-cancer drug. The active compound is a monocarboxylic polyether compound first isolated from Streptomyces albus strain (Strain No. 80614) shown to eliminate self-renewing cancer cells which may remain dormant or undetectable in the presence of traditional chemotherapeutics, such as paclitaxel or other agents commonly used as first-line agents in a variety of tumors. Salinomycin alone could not be advanced further after its discovery as an anti-cancer agent for a variety reasons, including a short half-life along with a relatively narrow therapeutic index and potential toxicities. Subsequently, other groups have shown cytotoxicity of the compound on human neuronal cells showing it had an increase on cytosolic Na+ concentrations consequently resulting in elevated cytosolic Ca2+. In addition, overdose or accidental ingestion of similar compounds has shown undesirable effects in cats, dogs, pigs, horses, as well as humans. These results and other data from third parties suggest it may be prudent to develop tissue-specific strategies to deliver the drug and prevent neuro-specific adverse events and capitalize on the specific mechanisms of HSB-1216’s active drug.
Clinical Data with HSB-1216’s Active Drug
 
For several reasons, HSB-1216’s active drug was not established as a human drug due to several reports published by third parties in the past decades which reveal considerable toxicity in mammals such as horses, pigs, cats and alpacas after accidental oral ingestion or inhalation. It has been relegated to use in livestock as a coccidiostat and growth promoter. The European Food Safety Authority has declared an acceptable daily intake of 5 µg/kg. Based on these findings, the compound was therapeutically used in a “first-in-man” clinical pilot study conducted at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, with a cohort of 7 patients with metastatic breast, ovarian and head and neck cancers in which tumor and metastatic regression were observed clinically in 4 patients with metastatic breast cancer, 1 patient with metastatic ovarian cancer, and 2 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (1 of the head and neck and the other of the vulva). Administration of 200- 250 μg·kg−1 of active drug intravenously every second day for three weeks in these patients resulted in partial regression of tumor metastasis. Intravenous active drug therapy resulted in tachycardia and mild tremor for 30-60 minutes after administration but lacked side effects observed with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, such as myelosuppression, neutropenia, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, or gastrointestinal, thromboembolic, and neurological side effects. Only 2 of the 7 cases are described in the publication relating to this trial, both of which are detailed below showing that these promising results inducing cancer regression of heavily pretreated and therapy-resistant tumor types may define HSB-1216’s active drug to have novel effects as a clinically significant anticancer agent.
 
Thirty months prior to treatment with the HSB-1216’s active drug, a 40-year-old female patient was diagnosed with unilateral ductal breast carcinoma (post-mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection) and subsequently experienced a recurrence of the subcutaneous multifocal thoracic tumor that was ER, PR, and HER2 negative (i.e., “triple negative”) with vertebral bone metastasis. After all therapeutic options were exhausted, experimental treatment with HSB-1216’s active drug was recommended. The patient received 12 systemic administrations of intravenous (“IV”) treatment at a dose of 200 µg·kg-1 given every other day. After 12 cycles, there was a marked regression of the subcutaneous thoracic metastases (Figure 7). A biopsy of the metastatic tissue, as investigated by molecular histopathology, demonstrated that approximately 85% of the cells had undergone apoptosis. Additionally, serum levels of the tumor marker Ca 15-3 decreased from 14.3 U/mL before therapy to 7.2 U/mL after therapy. Similarly, serum levels of Carcinoembryonic antigen, another tumor marker, declined from 50.8 ng/mL to 15.5 ng/mL posttreatment. These results demonstrate that the drug was not only able to kill hard-to-treat cancers, but also more differentiated tumor cells and more importantly, highly indolent tumor cells displaying efficient mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic drugs, radiation, and induction of apoptosis.

Figure 7: Clinical Pilot Study
 

In a second case study, 18 months prior to treatment with HSB-1216’s active drug, an 82-year-old female patient was diagnosed with advanced and metastatic (pelvic lymphatic metastasis) squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (after radical vulvectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection). Given a poor therapeutic response to existing treatments at the time and exhaustion of therapeutic options, experimental treatment of HSB-1216’s active drug in combination with erlotinib was recommended for this patient. The patient received 14 IV administrations of the drug at a dose of 200 µg·kg-1 given every other day plus erlotinib 150 mg daily for 30 days. Significant tumor regression was observed 30 days after combination therapy, based on clinical inspection of the tumor, as well as decreased serum level of squamous cell carcinoma (“SCC”) antigen from 11.3 ng/mL before combination therapy to 0.13 ng/mL after therapy. Three months post-treatment, SCC levels increased to 3.2 ng/mL, and clinical inspection demonstrated significant tumor progression.
 
After experiencing numerous marked adverse effects with erlotinib (including fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and inappetence), the patient refused further treatment with erlotinib and was retreated with HSB-1216’s active drug as monotherapy. The patient received 12 IV administrations at a dose of 200 µg·kg-1 given every other day, which resulted in no progression and stable disease for 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 4 months post-treatment, based on clinical inspection of the local tumor and no marked changes in SCC.

Figure 8: 2012 - Human Serum Levels of the Tumor Marker in Squamous Cell Carcinoma in vitro
 

These results demonstrate that the drug is able to induce partial clinical regression of heavily pretreated and therapy-resistant cancers, particularly in combination with novel tumor-targeted drugs.
 
HSB-1216 Pre-Clinical Data
 
HSB-1216’s active drug has been shown to target elusive cancer cells in different types of human cancers, including gastric cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and prostate, suggesting that the drug may be effective against side populations of many types of human cancers. The drug is able to enhance the cytotoxic effects of conventional chemotherapeutics and novel tumor-targeted drugs in regular cancer cells, potentially playing a central role for HSB-1216-based combination therapies in the future treatment of cancer.

Figure 9: HSB-1216 Inhibits Tumor Growth in Mouse Model of SCLC
 

According to the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, there are anticipated to be more than 230,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States in 2021, and according to the American Cancer Society, SCLC comprises approximately 10-15% of all lung cancers. Although SCLC is responsive to chemotherapy, recurrence occurs rapidly, with less than 7% of patients surviving over five years. SCLC has shown to be responsive to immunotherapy with approximately one-third of patients responding to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and achieving a median overall survival of approximately eight months. The need to rapidly advance therapeutics is an urgent, unmet medical need in these recurrent cases. In one pre-clinical mouse model of SCLC conducted by a third party in Asia, both HSB-1216’s active drug as well as HSB-1216 showed no antitumor activity in vivo, believed to be due to lab dilution errors of the test articles. The same articles showed marked antitumor activity in a tumor sphere model owing to the potent effects of both compounds. Our previous studies with HSB-1216 has shown a profound inhibition of tumor growth as a once-weekly injectable product in a nude mouse xenograft models utilizing an N-H69 SCLC cell line, with three 5 mg/kg doses administered over three weeks when compared to placebo.

Figure 10: HSB-1216 is 2x-4x More Potent Against Chemo-Resistant SCLC Cell in vitro
 

HSB-1216 is two to four times more potent in chemoresistant SCLC. Using chemoresistant cell lines for SCLC (NCI-H69AR), our approach demonstrates an increased potency of our compound using our Quatramer formulation when compared to standard-of-care therapies for these resistant tumor types.
 
HSB-1216 Clinical Plan in Solid Tumors
 
We intend to submit an IND for our HSB-1216 product candidate for solid tumors to the FDA in the second half of 2023, and, if approved, we plan to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial to obtain human pharmacokinetic data and dose optimization data on our formulation thereafter; however, no assurance can be provided that our IND will be accepted by the FDA in 2023, if at all. Based on the data obtained from pre-clinical studies, we believe a Phase 1 basket trial can be conducted in the US with HSB-1216 where there are limited therapies. Even with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICIs”), there remains a large patient population which either does not benefit from allowing HSB-1216 to potentially prolong survival in ICI failures as well as recurrent disease patients.

HSB-3215: 
 
The ErbB or HER family of cell surface proteins are some of the most well-known and validated oncology drug targets including ErbB2 or HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor) and Erb3 or HER3. The family of antibodies and biologics against HER2 starting with HERCEPTIN® (trastuzumab) approved in 1998 for breast cancer, one of the first few anti-cancer antibodies, as well as PERJETA® (pertuzumab), KADCYLA® (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) and PHESGO® (Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase) reported 2022 sales of greater than $8 billion for Roche/Genentech. Antibodies against HER2 and HER3 bind to different domains of the extracellular portion of the proteins or epitopes with trastuzumab primarily binding the extracellular domain IV of HER2. HER2 is a validated tumor antigen for antibody drug conjugates to treat HER2 positive cancers with two approved antibodies, Roche/Genentech’s KADCYLA® and Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU®.
 
Figure 11: Anti-ErbB2 (HER2) and Anti-ErbB3 (HER3) Antibodies
 

HSB-1940: 
 
Combining Quatramers with their long half-life coated with a PD-1 Picobody to create HSB-1940, we believe we can more efficiently target novel epitopes with greater binding affinity than approved biologics. We further believe that targeting PD-1 is a step toward enabling us to enter the rapidly growing IO therapeutics market with additional IO targets such as programed death- ligand 1 (“PD-L1”), HER-2 and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (“TROP-2”).
 
Antibodies derived from mouse or human sources use the surface formed by CDRs on the variable regions of the heavy chain (VH)/light chain (VL) heterodimer typically forming a relatively flat binding surface which then binds the target protein. Alternative species, particularly camelids and bovines, provide a paradigm for antigen recognition through novel domains which form the antigen binding site. However, for camelids, heavy chain antibodies bind antigen with only a single heavy chain variable region (VH), in the absence of light chains. Meanwhile, in bovines, ultralong CDR-H3 regions form an independently folding mini-domain, which protrudes far out from the surface of the antibody and forms a “stalk and knob” structure. The “knob” is diverse in its structure, small size and weight, sequence and disulfide patterns. The “knob” (Picobody) component can be expressed as an independent antigen binding domain with three times smaller size (~4-6 kDa) than a camelid “nanobody” making it the smallest known antibody fragment. These atypical antigen binding sites of bovines potentially provide the ability to interact with different antigenic determinants or epitopes, particularly recessed or concave surfaces, compared to traditional full-length mouse or human antibodies.

Iron Mediated Cell Death Inducer Analogues Program
 
In December 2019, we acquired intellectual property and data related to analogues of HSB-1216’s active drug with varying molecular constructs with increased efficacy against a subgroup of tumors consisting of breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Several lead analogues have demonstrated increased potency when compared to HSB-1216’s active drug, whereby the increased potency of these compounds is expected to have ferroptotic effects greater than HSB-1216’s active drug at micro-dosage levels, creating an increased therapeutic index as novel small molecules. We expect to develop these advanced compounds as follow-on therapeutics to HSB-1216 to treat a variety of high unmet needs, including orphan cancers, which are sensitive to the ferroptotic pathway.

Quatramer Technology
 
Overview
 
Our proprietary Quatramer technology is based on know-how and permits manufacture of uniform size polymer aggregates that can be packaged and tuned specifically to interact with pharmaceutical drugs, biological molecules and/or combinations of molecules to bypass delivery problems. The system is biocompatible and can be tailored to form therapeutics which solubilize the drug in aqueous media such as human plasma and blood which dramatically increases the amount of drug available at the disease site while administering a lower dose.
 
Our studies have shown that targeted delivery of drugs to a site of action, including tumors, is directly related to the length of time of a circulating therapeutic in the bloodstream. This is an expected outcome as most drug delivery formulations delivering payloads to sites of action are cleared extremely rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system (“RES”) in the liver. The stealth nature of our technology allows for a prolonged circulation time whereby there is accumulation at the site of disease prior to being cleared.

The size, shape and surface of our Quatramer allows it to escape via gaps in the blood vessels in the TME allowing for release of the payload directly into cancerous cells. Furthermore, the system functions as a “peeling onion” in coordinated and precise acidic versus basic conditions depending on the TME as well as inside cancerous cells. Certain portions of the technology release a payload due to its own physicochemical characteristics while the core of the Quatramer system would release a different payload depending on its own chemical and physical properties. This type of a profile for certain of our Quatramer therapeutics, particularly our combination products, are specifically designed to cleave or disperse in response to external stimuli causing internal changes for delivery and is a designed approach to our size tunable vehicles.

Figure 14: Quatramer Platform – Intracellular Payload Delivery and Disintegration
 

This designed size tunable feature of certain of our Quatramer compositions offer further advantages, as certain cleaved materials create a reversal of drug resistance in cells. Drug resistance can be classified into two categories: de novo resistance or acquired resistance. Cancer patients that exhibit de novo resistance do not respond to chemotherapy from the start. However, in acquired resistance, the cancer cells initially respond to a drug but eventually acquire resistance to it and the cells might also show cross-resistance to other structurally and mechanistically unrelated drugs, a phenomenon commonly known as MDR whereby treatment regimens that combine multiple agents with different targets are no longer effective. Our Quatramer technology circumvents this phenomenon upon cleavage of the payload from the system, whereby the remnants of the system, such as certain hydrophobic chains flanked by hydrophilic chains which are not related to therapeutic efficacy, cause drug efflux pump blockage and allow the payload to continue to be effective in MDR cellular systems both in vitro and in vivo.
 
Quatramer physicochemical characterization allows for optimizing size, shape and surface chemistry based on payload characteristics to render enhanced permeation and retention into the TME. Our scientific know-how and scientific expertise in developing Quatramer based therapeutics has led to understanding the optimal conditions for encapsulating therapeutics of different physicochemical characteristics into our proprietary delivery, and the combination of multiple materials used varies depending on the drug itself, causing a highly specific tunability platform that can be scaled. The proprietary know-how behind our Quatramer structures with multiple layering allows for therapeutics of different levels of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity to interact within aqueous mediums of varied acid-base conditions, including human serum and blood. The importance of the Quatramer structure extends the certain aspects of the core and thereby has the capacity to increase drug uptake and sustain its release over long periods of time, including over many days and weeks in both in vitro and in vivo systems.

Our Quatramer technology has been designed to be a scalable process with production efficiency whereby the analysis of the output of a designed chemistry, manufacturing and controls system creates a predictable and uniform product with controllable capability and cost efficiency. Chemical compositions listed in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database with known profile. Combined with the tunability of Quatramer, the technology allows for a variety of delivery payloads including peptides, small molecules, nucleic acids and antibodies with the added flexibility of dual-loaded payload therapeutics. The payload diversity and flexibility of the system coupled with its numerous advantages allows for a targeted system with prolonged circulation time, which takes advantage of an efficient EPR effect with numerous mechanistic features deployed at various conditions with the TME as well as in intracellular environments, which makes the methodology of Quatramer therapeutics, a highly advantageous platform to deliver low doses of therapeutics directly to tumors.
 
Quatrabody Technology:
 
Quatramer™, a proprietary tumor targeting platform, with their long half-life are coated with a Picobody™ to create unique IO antibodies. Picobodies are antibody “knob” domains comprised of cysteine-rich ultralong CDR H3 sequences of 30-40 amino acids, which have the potential to access challenging epitopes better than full size antibodies can. We believe we may be able to more efficiently target novel epitopes with greater binding affinity than approved biologics. Targeting PD-1, PDL-1, HER-2 and TROP-2 is a step toward enabling us to enter the rapidly growing IO markets.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to disrupt the biotechnology landscape by developing novel therapeutics by leveraging our targeted-delivery Quatramer platform-based therapeutic to address significant unmet medical needs, with a focus on treatments for cancer. We believe that our technology has the potential to generate differentiated products that have the potential to treat rare and treatment resistant tumors.
 
Our business strategy includes:
 

● | Developing drug candidate, HSB-1216, in solid tumors. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
Data from a clinical pilot study conducted at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, led us to progress HSB-1216 into IND-enabling studies with the goal of submitting an IND to the FDA in 2023. These IND-enabling trials are pre-clinical in nature and include toxicology and pharmacokinetic profiling as well as bioanalytical assay development. After discussions with the FDA, we expect to use the 505(b)(1) FDA approval pathway and conduct a Phase 1 trial to obtain initial pharmacokinetic and dosing information in patients. We intend to evaluate the development of HSB-1216 in other high-unmet need oncology indications, including certain brain, breast and prostate cancers, and in combination with other cancer therapies.
 

● | Developing drug candidate, HSB-3215 
--+--------------------------------------

 
The ErbB family of cell surface proteins are some of the most well-known and validated oncology drug targets including ErbB2 or HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor) and Erb3 or HER3. Antibodies against HER2 and HER3 bind to different domains of the extracellular portion of the proteins or epitopes with trastuzumab primarily binding the extracellular domain IV of HER2. HER2 is a validated tumor antigen for antibody drug conjugates to treat HER2 positive cancers with two approved antibodies, Roche/Genentech’s KADCYLA® and Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU®. Monoclonal antibodies being developed at ABSI are unique from the currently approved anti-HER2 antibodies. ABSI has granted us an exclusive option to license certain of its proprietary technology which will allow us to develop HER2 and HER3 antibodies, including multi-specific and Quatramer- based therapeutics incorporating portions of the antibodies. The ABSI option terminates on March 24, 2023, unless extended by the parties.
 

● | Developing drug candidate, HSB-1940 
--+--------------------------------------

 
The Quatrabody™ provides an entry into next generation of IO biologics including, bispecific and trispecific antibodies, ADCs, CAR-T, CAR-NKs and others. Quatrabodies capitalize on the long half-life of tumor targeting Quatramers, combined with Picobodies™, bovine-derived antibody “knob” domains which have potential to access and bind more tightly to “undruggable” epitopes better than full sized antibodies. HSB-1940 is a combination of the Quatramer and PD-1 targeting Picobodies. Quatrabodies have the potential for delivering an increased drug payload to the tumor with a longer half-life while targeting novel “undruggable” epitopes of well-known and validated IO targets such as PD-1.

● | Leveraging our novel platform to develop a pipeline of high value Quatramer leads. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The tunability of our technology allows us to efficiently expand our pipeline of Quatramer, both on our own and in collaboration with others, through various combinations of targeted DNA encoded for anti-tumor cytokines and therapeutic payloads, which enables us to move into other areas of oncology, including IO whereby we could potentially increase the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (“ICIs”).
 

● | Developing and commercializing Quatramer in collaboration with leading pharmaceutical companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to our internal development programs, we actively seek opportunities to collaborate with recognized biopharmaceutical companies to develop Quatramer incorporating therapeutic payloads from their proprietary product portfolios. We intend to establish collaborations with industry leaders and strategic pharmaceutical organizations.
 

● | Commercializing proprietary Quatramer based products, including HSB-1216, directly in the United States and with collaborators outside the United States. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We own HSB-1216 and our other proprietary pipeline and expect to maintain similar rights with respect to other proprietary Quatramer we develop. Following FDA approval in the United States, we may partner with a larger biopharmaceutical company as well as potentially build a focused oncology sales organization to market Quatramer-based therapeutics. Outside of the United States, we intend to rely on collaborators to commercialize proprietary approved Quatramer.
 

● | Continuing to extend and protect our product technology and Quatramer through our intellectual property portfolio. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We seek to protect our novel platform through U.S. and international patents as well as know-how and trade secrets relating to the design and manufacturing of our technology. We expect to continue to file patent applications as we apply our technology to new targets and therapeutic payloads. In addition, we believe the heightened regulatory requirements for generics of this technology may strengthen the protection afforded by our intellectual property portfolio.
 
Our Team
 
Our Chief Executive Officer and directors have extensive scientific, drug development, and commercialization experience across pertinent disciplines including oncology; small molecule, peptide and antibody drug manufacturing and quality; clinical drug development, and commercialization. Our Chief Executive Officer and directors have held various research, clinical development, artificial intelligence, strategy, corporate development and operational positions at large biopharmaceutical companies, public biotechnology companies, and universities having worked at companies such as DuPont Merck Pharmaceuticals, Amgen Inc., Exelixis, Inc., Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Global Cancer Research Institute, Sanofi and UCLA School of Medicine. Our Chief Executive Officer and directors have been involved in the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of multiple marketed products across various therapeutic areas, including, but not limited to, Cabometyx® (cabozantinib), Remicade® (infliximab) and Clolar® (clofarabine).

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products and intellectual property. We face competition from major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, emerging and start-up companies, universities and other research institutions both in the United States and internationally. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Earlier stage companies, such as smaller discovery phase biotechnology companies, may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Some of our competitors include BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Ferro Therapeutic, Inc.), Kojin Therapeutics, Inc., Bayer AG, Moderna Inc., Roche/Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market, including the therapeutics payload in HSB-1216, for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our drug candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy and targeted drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for solid tumors. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis, including drugs in the same therapeutic class as the payloads contained in HSB-1216.
 

29
--


Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of solid tumors and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none of them are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from solid tumor cancers remains high.
 
There are also a number of products in clinical development to treat solid tumors including, but not limited to, Loxo Oncology (LOXO-292), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS-986016 and nivolumab) Mersana / GlaxoSmithKline (XMT-2056), Zymeworks (zenidatamab) and Eli Lilly & Co (sintilimab) in addition to those products already on the market such as Merck & Co Inc. (Keytruda), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Opdivo), AbbVie Inc. (Imbruvica), Roche Group (Tecentiq), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Libtayo). The products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate any facilities in which we can formulate or manufacture our product candidates. We intend to rely on contract manufacturers to produce all materials required to conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials under current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”), with oversight of these activities by our management team. We have identified alternate sources of supply and other contract manufacturers that can produce materials for our pre-clinical and clinical trial requirements on a timely basis. However, if an existing or future contract manufacturer fails to deliver on schedule, or at all, it may delay or interrupt the development process for our product candidates which may have an adverse effect on our operating results and estimated timelines.
Intellectual Property
 
The intellectual property that is available to us is important for our business, and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent protection in the United States and internationally for our proprietary technology, improvements, platforms, products and components thereof, novel biological discoveries, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, generally we initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of production, and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates and technologies, we will seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection.
 
As of March 10, 2023, our patent portfolio includes 11 patent families. These families include 14 issued patents and 43 pending applications related generally to our polymeric nanoparticle technologies, methods of making our polymeric nanoparticle technologies, and methods of using our polymeric nanoparticles therapeutically (e.g., for delivery of therapeutic compounds). Specifically, our patent portfolio currently includes four issued U.S. patents, and ten granted patents in foreign jurisdictions, as well as six pending applications in the U.S. and 37 abroad. Patent protection for the earliest-filed family is expected to expire in 2033, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions, with more recently-filed families expiring approximately between 2033 and 2042. We may file other patent applications in the future.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment (“PTA”), which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining and granting a patent or the term of a patent may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension (“PTE”) after FDA approval for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. PTE can be for no more than five years, typically only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. In addition, the length of the adjustment or extension granted could be less than that requested, and we may not receive the full PTA or PTE available if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fails to apply within applicable deadlines, fails to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise fails to satisfy applicable requirements.
 
As with many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our products will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those patent claims. However, our owned pending patent applications, and any patent applications that may be filed in the future or licensed from third parties, may not result in issuance. The breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents also cannot be predicted. Any of our issued patents or patents obtained in the future may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a therapeutic product that may be developed, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.


We have filed an intent-to-use U.S. trademark application for “HILLSTREAM BIOPHARMA” (for “Pharmaceutical preparations for use in cancer treatment and therapies”) in International class 5. We have filed an intent-to-use U.S. trademark application for “QUATRAMER” and QUATRABODY (both for “Nano particle technologies and nanoparticle technologies for cancer therapy and treatment, namely, drug delivery agents in the form of nanoparticles that provide controlled release of active ingredients for a wide variety of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer”) in International class 5. We also hold a pending U.S. trademark application for HILLSTREAM BIOPHARMA, claiming use of the mark for “Research and development in the field of oncology” in International class 42.
 
Minotaur Research and Collaboration Agreement and Taurus License Agreement
 
Hillstream has entered into a research collaboration and product license agreement with Minotaur and a commercial license agreement with Taurus for use of certain technology, including OmniAb antibodies, to advance Picobodies against novel, unreachable and undruggable epitopes in high-value validated targets starting with PD-1. The research and collaboration agreement and product license agreement is for the development of proprietary targeted biologics, Knob Quatrabodies™ (HSB-1940), against PD-1.
 
The technologies of Hillstream and Minotaur will be combined under the license from Taurus to discover, develop and advance biotherapeutics against high-value validated IO targets. Picobodies are bovine-derived antibody “knob” domains comprised of cysteine-rich ultralong CDR H3 sequences of 30-40 amino acids weighing ~3-4KDa, which have the potential to access challenging epitopes better than full size antibodies can.
 
By combining Quatramers with their long half-life coated with a PD-1 Picobody™ to create HSB-1940, Hillstream believes it could more efficiently target novel epitopes with greater binding affinity than approved anti-PD-1 antibodies. We further believe that the development of HSB-1940 is a step toward enabling us to enter the rapidly growing IO market with additional targets thereafter.
 
Applied Biomedical Research Institute Option Agreement
 
ABSI has developed technology to target unique functional epitopes of the cancer targets HER2 and HER3. Monoclonal antibodies being developed at ABSI are unique from the currently approved anti-HER2 antibodies. ABSI has granted us an exclusive option to license technology to develop HER2 and HER3 antibodies, including multi-specific and Quatramer-based therapeutics incorporating portions of the antibodies. These antibodies could be incorporated into proprietary multi-format biologics (bi- and tri-specific antibodies, ADCs (antibody drug conjugates), CAR-T and CAR-NKs, in Quatramers and Quatrabodies) against drug resistant cancers including HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer. The ABSI option terminates on March 24, 2023, unless extended by the parties.
Government Regulations
 
Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by us. In the U.S., the FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FsDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 
United States Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning or untitled letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and clinical study related regulations, referred to as Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”); 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements; 
● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale. 

 
Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance and may be imposed on all drug products within a certain class of drugs. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
 

32
--


All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an institutional review board (“IRB”) must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 


33
--


Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Companies that conduct certain clinical trials also are required to register them and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, www.clinicaltrials.gov, in the United States, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
NDA and FDA Review Process
 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, which request approval to market a new drug product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review.

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. The decision to accept the NDA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of the NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and may go through multiple review cycles.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter describes specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.

There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical trials to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals, including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
Orange Book Listing and Paragraph IV Certification
 
For NDA submissions, including those under Section 505(b)(2), applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval, each of the patents listed in the application is published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who subsequently files an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA that references a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV Certification.
 
If an applicant has provided a Paragraph IV Certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV Certification to the holder of the NDA for the approved drug and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to notice of the Paragraph IV Certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV Certification prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, the applicant’s successful defense of the suit, or expiration of the patent.

Reimbursement
 
Potential sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, at least in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our future revenues and results of operations. Decreases in third-party reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product candidate, if approved, or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In the United States, the Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary outpatient drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries for certain products. We do not know whether our product candidates, if approved, will be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D, but individual Medicare Part D plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare industry is highly regulated under both state and federal laws and regulations. Our operations and relationships with healthcare plans and providers are subject to extensive and increasing regulation by numerous federal, state, and local government agencies including the FDA, the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the CMS, the Office of Civil Rights, and various state authorities.
 
The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:
 
False Claims Acts
 
We will be subject to numerous federal and state laws that prohibit the presentation of false information, or the failure to disclose information, in connection with the submission and payment of medical claims for reimbursement.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, impose civil liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly or recklessly: presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government; made, used or caused to be made or used a false statement or a false record to get a claim for payment approved, including a false or fraudulent claim; concealed, or knowingly and improperly avoided or decreased, an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or conspired to commit any of the foregoing.

The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs. The federal government, including as a result of the passage of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), and a number of courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of certain other statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) or the federal physician referral law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn (the “Stark Law”), can also be considered a violation of the False Claims Act.
 
A number of states have enacted laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Under Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, as amended, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, the state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under the state’s false claims act. As a result, many states have enacted laws that are similar to the federal False Claims Act and there has been a concomitant increase in state false claims enforcement efforts. Violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including significant penalties, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight under a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, and/or exclusion or suspension from federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $13,508 to $27,018 for each false claim adjusted each year for inflation, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. In addition to the provisions of the False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government for payments. Additionally, private parties may initiate qui tam whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the False Claims Act in the name of the federal government, as well as under the false claims laws of several states, and may share in the proceeds of a successful suit. Generally, federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse a priority.
 
The Federal “Stark” Law
 
The Federal Stark Law (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn) prohibits referrals or ordering by a physician of “designated health services,” which include pharmaceuticals and drugs that are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Financial relationships that are implicated by the Stark Law can include arrangements ranging from marketing arrangements and consulting agreements to medical director agreements with physicians who order our products. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. Many federal healthcare reform proposals in the past few years have attempted to expand the Stark Law to cover all patients as well. If we violate the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Federal and State Anti-Kickback Statutes
 
The AKS, set forth in Section 1128B of the Social Security Act, prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person for items or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs or (iii) the purchase, lease or order or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under federal healthcare programs.
 
The core of a violation of the AKS is an “inducement” to refer patients for services or items that are reimbursed under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare (which covers military personnel). The ACA amended the AKS to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. Court cases have resulted in the interpretation that a violation may occur where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals, and the OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted a similar standard.
 
There are certain AKS “safe harbors” which, if the respective requirements are met, would afford protection from the AKS. Failure to meet all requirements of an AKS safe harbor does not necessarily mean the arrangement violates the AKS, but it may be subject to scrutiny by legal authorities, in light of the parties’ intent and arrangements. In other words, if an arrangement does not fit within a safe harbor, it does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is per se illegal-only that it is not shielded from regulatory scrutiny. The federal AKS provides criminal penalties for individuals or entities that knowingly and willfully solicit or receive any remuneration. A violation of the AKS is punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per offense, or both. Violation can also give rise to federal healthcare program exclusion, liability under the False Claims Act and civil penalties, which may include monetary penalties of up to $100,000 per offense, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement and suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Additionally, some states have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the AKS, but which may be applicable regardless of the payor source for the patient. These state laws may contain exceptions and safe harbors that are different from and/or more limited than those of federal law and that may vary from state to state.

Health Care Fraud Statute
 
The Health Care Fraud Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347, prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1035, prohibits, in any matter involving a federal healthcare program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both.
Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”), 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7a, authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments, and exclusions against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to: (i) presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that the individual or entity knows or should know are for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; (ii) offering remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive healthcare items or services from a particular provider; (iii) arranging contracts with an entity or individual excluded from participation in a federal healthcare program; (iv) violating the federal AKS; (v) making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim for payment for items and services furnished under a federal healthcare program; (vi) making, using, or causing to be made any false statement, omission, or misrepresentation of a material fact in any application, bid, or contract to participate or enroll as a provider of services or a supplier under a federal healthcare program; and (vii) failing to report and return an overpayment owed to the federal government. We could be exposed to a wide range of allegations to which the federal CMPL would apply. We cannot foreclose the possibility that we will face allegations subject to the CMPL with the potential for a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Statute and may vary, depending on the underlying violation. In addition, an assessment of not more than three times the total amount claimed for each item or service may also apply, and a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.
 
Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
