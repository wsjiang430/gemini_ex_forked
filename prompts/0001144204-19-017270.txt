Marketing and Business Development
 
The Company markets its products domestically, through the coordinated efforts of the sales, marketing and customer service teams.
 
The Company has moved towards a strategy of utilizing these combined sales and marketing resources for cross-selling all products across all business lines. This strategy is well suited to the diverse and fragmented markets that utilize photonic technologies.
 
Independent sales agents are used in major non-U.S. markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel, and Japan.
 
Sales and marketing efforts are coordinated by the Vice President, Sales and Marketing, to promote our product lines through various means including participation in trade shows, internet based marketing, media and non-media advertising and promotion and management of international sales representatives and distributors.
 
Backlog
 
The Company’s order backlog at December 31, 2018 was $6,480,000. The Company’s order backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $6,512,000.
 
We anticipate shipping a substantial majority of the present backlog during fiscal year 2019. However, our backlog at any given date may consist of orders with delivery schedules that extend beyond 12 months into the future.
Competition
 
Within each product category in which the Company’s business units are active, there is competition.
 
Changes in the photonics industry have had an effect on suppliers of custom optics. As end users have introduced products requiring large volumes of optical components, suppliers have responded either by staying small and carving out niche product areas, or by ramping up manufacturing capacity and modernizing their manufacturing methods to meet higher volume production rates. Additionally, the availability of an increasingly large variety of inventoried inexpensive catalog optics has led some OEM manufacturers to “design in” these low-cost solutions rather than utilizing custom designed and manufactured products.
 
Competition for the Company’s crystal devices and instrumentation is more limited and the Company’s laser devices are considered to be high quality and generally offer a combination of features not available elsewhere. As a result of the Company’s in-house crystal growth capability, this area of the business is highly vertically integrated, providing a competitive advantage over other suppliers.
 
For crystal products, the market is highly competitive. Many of the Company’s competitors who supply non-linear optical crystals are located overseas, and can offer significantly reduced pricing for some crystal materials. On many occasions, the quality of the crystal component drives the ultimate performance of the component or instrument into which it is installed. Quality and technical support are considered to be valuable attributes for a crystal supplier by some, but not all, OEM customers.
 
Our metal optics product line has several key competitors who are larger and better equipped to compete on high volume work. There are also several large and small competitors who compete with our products on large form factor optics. The Company has made recent inroads within this competitive landscape, and is building brand awareness in the marketplace.
 
Although price is a principal factor in many product categories, competition is also based on product design, performance, customer confidence, quality, delivery, and customer service. Based on its performance to date, the Company believes that it can continue to compete successfully, although no assurances can be given in this regard.
 
Employees
 
As of the close of business on March 25, 2019, the Company had 58 full-time employees.
 
Patents and Licenses
 
The Company mainly relies on its manufacturing and technological expertise, know-how and trade secrets in addition to its patents, to maintain its competitive position in the industry. The Company takes precautionary and protective measures to safeguard its technical design and manufacturing processes. The Company executes nondisclosure agreements with its employees and, where appropriate, with its customers, suppliers and other associates.
Regulation
 
Foreign sales of certain of the Company’s products to certain countries may require export licenses from the United States Department of Commerce. Such licenses are obtained when required. All requested export licenses of Inrad Optics products have been granted or deemed not-required.
