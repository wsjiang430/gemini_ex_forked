Industry Overview 
 PCBs are manufactured in panels from sheets of laminated material. Each panel is typically subdivided into multiple PCBs, each consisting of a pattern of electrical circuitry etched from copper to provide an electrical connection between the components mounted to it. PCBs serve as the foundation for virtually all electronic products, including the electronic components integrated into automobiles, consumer electronics products (smartphones and touchscreen tablets), high-end commercial electronic equipment (such as medical equipment, data communications routers, switches and servers) and aerospace and defense electronic systems. 
 In recent years, the demand for smaller sized electronic devices with more features and functionality has been increasing. Products designed to offer faster data transmission, thinner and more lightweight packaging, and reduced power consumption generally require increasingly complex PCBs to meet these criteria. By using advanced processes such as High Density Interconnect (HDI) and modified semi-additive process (mSAP) technologies, circuit densities can be increased, thereby providing for smaller products with higher packaging densities. Furthermore, rigid-flex circuits can be found in small and lightweight end products, such as smartphones and touchscreen tablets and increasingly in other end markets such as automotive, industrial and aerospace and defense. PCB manufacturers also manufacture substrates that serve as the interconnect between integrated circuits (ICs) and the PCB. With the Anaren acquisition, we now also manufacture advanced RF components and sub-systems. We collectively refer to all of these technologies as “advanced technologies,” and they generally have growth rates which are higher than conventional technologies. In addition, most of our markets have low volume requirements during the prototype stage that demand a highly flexible manufacturing environment which later transitions to a higher volume requirement during product ramp. 
 According to estimates in a November 2018 report by Prismark Partners, worldwide demand for PCBs was approximately $58.8 billion in 2017. Of this worldwide demand for production in 2017, Prismark Partners reports that PCB production in the Americas accounted for approximately 5% (approximately $2.7 billion), PCB production in China accounted for approximately 50% (approximately $29.7 billion), and PCB production in the rest of the world accounted for approximately 45% (approximately $26.4 billion). According to the same report by Prismark Partners, worldwide demand for PCBs is forecast to grow at a 4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2017 to 2022 driven mostly by multilayer boards and package substrates. Prismark Partners expects 5G wireless infrastructure to be a growth driver for the PCB market in 2019. In addition, Prismark Partners expects the PCB markets to have a moderate annual growth from 2019 onwards until it picks up again slightly in 2022.
Industry Trends 
 We believe that several trends impacting the PCB manufacturing industry which will benefit us in the future. These trends include: 
 Shorter electronic product life cycles, which create opportunities for PCB manufacturers that can offer engineering support in the prototype stage and manufacturing scalability throughout the production life cycle. 
 Increasing complexity of electronic products, which requires technologically complex PCBs that can accommodate higher speeds and component densities, including HDI, flexible, and substrate PCBs as well as intricately engineered RF components and subsystems. 
 Higher demand for reliable product manufactured in the U.S., encompassing better oversight on sub-tier supply chain materials and controls.
 Growing utilization of PCB technology in automobiles. An increasing trend toward sophisticated safety systems, automated driving, electric/hybrid vehicles and miniaturization of electronic devices in the automotive industry is driving increasing electronic content and higher PCB usage in automobiles, particularly with regard to the increased demand for advanced technologies like HDI, rigid-flex and RF PCBs for radar. 
 Increasing concentration of global PCB production in Asia.   China has emerged as a global production center for electronics manufacturers. We believe that the expected continued concentration of consumer electronic production in China should result in additional commercial market share potential for PCB manufacturers with a strong presence and reputation in China. 
 Supply chain consolidation by commercial OEMs.    We believe that PCB manufacturers which can offer one-stop manufacturing capabilities — from prototype to volume production — have a competitive advantage in the market. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to be the leading global provider of time-critical, one-stop manufacturing services for highly complex PCBs and RF components. Our core strategy includes the following elements: 
 Provide differentiated capabilities beyond the base PCB by incorporating advanced design-to-specification engineering support, testing, components and specialized assembly into the value-added package provided to customers.   With the acquisition of Anaren, TTM has moved beyond build to print manufacturing and assembly capabilities to engage with customers in designing a more complete RF solution to meet their technology needs. With the additional design capabilities, TTM now provides cost effective, ready for manufacture, enabling technologies to the customer. We intend to build on the Anaren acquisition to deepen our RF engagement with key aerospace and defense customers as well as to carry this same capability to our commercial automotive, telecom and networking customers.

Maintain our customer-driven culture and provide superior service to our customers in our core markets of aerospace and defense, automotive, cellular phones, computing and storage, medical/industrial/instrumentation, and networking/communications.    Our customer-oriented culture is designed to achieve extraordinary service, competitive differentiation, and superior execution. Our customer-oriented strategies include engaging in co-development of new products, capturing new technology products for next generation equipment, and continuing investments to enhance our broad offering of PCB and RF/microwave technologies. We believe our ability to anticipate and meet customers’ needs is critical to retaining existing customers and attracting leading companies as new customers. 
 Drive operational efficiency and productivity.    We are highly focused on improving our operational execution to increase efficiency, productivity and yields. We strongly believe in the benefits of sharing best practices across our extensive manufacturing footprint and rely on stringent goals for throughput, quality and customer satisfaction to measure our effectiveness. The fast paced nature of our business requires a disciplined approach to manufacturing that is rooted in continuous improvement. 
 Accelerate customer and end-market diversification through strategic mergers and acquisitions.    We have a history of executing successful acquisitions that have been key to our growth and profitability. We continuously look for strategic opportunities that could facilitate our efforts to further diversify into other growing end markets including automotive and aerospace and defense. Our acquisition of Anaren increased our service and product offering for our broad customer base. Additionally, our acquisition of Anaren deepened our engagement with existing leading customers in the telecom and aerospace and defense end markets, demonstrating the benefits of this strategy. 
 Accelerate our expansion into the automotive and other growing markets using our advanced technology as a key point of differentiation.    With rising requirements for faster data transmission, shrinking features (i.e., lightweight and thin), and lower power consumption, many PCB designs have migrated to more complex HDI PCBs from conventional multi-layer PCB technologies. This trend began with PCBs used in portable devices such as smartphones and touchscreen tablets but has become an increasing trend in other end markets, such as automotive, networking/communications, medical, and aerospace and defense. We are focused in particular on the automotive opportunity where the combination of our strength in highly reliable conventional and RF PCBs and our advanced technology PCB product capabilities allows us to meet our automotive customers’ growing demand in such areas as infotainment, radar systems, cameras for advanced driver assistance systems and electric vehicles. As our customers consolidate their supply chain, our objective is to differentiate ourselves as a strategic supplier with the technology breadth to meet most, if not all, of our automotive customers’ PCB requirements. 
 Address customer needs in all stages of the product life cycle.    By providing a one-stop solution, we work to service our customers’ needs from the earliest stages of product design and development through volume production. We believe that by servicing our customers early in the development process, we are able to demonstrate our capabilities and establish an incumbent position early in the product development cycle, which translates into additional opportunities as our customers move into volume production. We believe our expertise is enhanced by our ability to deliver highly complex PCBs to customers in significantly compressed lead times. This rapid delivery service enables OEMs to develop sophisticated electronic products more quickly and reduce their time to market. We believe we will be able to increase customer engagement with our acquisition of Anaren’s proprietary and customizable RF solutions from the concept stage through to volume, which typically results in higher customer engagement. 
 Deliver strong financial performance with improved asset turnover.    We aspire to deliver industry-leading financial performance. We expect to achieve this by servicing our customers’ needs in higher-growth end markets in a cost-efficient and effective manner. We believe that this strategy will allow us to generate strong cash flows, which will enable us to reduce financial leverage over time while at the same time providing us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, including through opportunistic acquisitions.

By offering this wide range of PCB products and complementary value-added services, we are able to provide our customers with a “one-stop” manufacturing solution for their PCB requirements. This differentiates us from our competition and enhances our relationships with our customers. 
 Conventional PCBs 
 A conventional PCB is made from a composite laminate that is metalized with a conductive material such as copper. The PCB is the basic platform used to interconnect components in most electronic products including computers, communications equipment, cellular phones, high-end consumer electronics, automotive controls, commercial aerospace and defense systems and medical and industrial equipment. Conventional PCBs can be classified as single-sided, double-sided and multi-layer boards. 
 5


We focus on higher layer count conventional PCBs. A multi-layer PCB can accommodate more complex circuitry than a single-sided or double-sided PCB and as such requires more sophisticated production techniques. The number of layers comprising a PCB often increases with the complexity of the end product. For example, a simple consumer device such as a garage door controller may use a single-sided or double-sided PCB, while a high-end network router or computer server may use a PCB with 30 or more layers. 
 RF and microwave circuits 
 We produce and test specialized circuits used in radio-frequency or microwave emission and collection applications. These products are typically used for radar, transmit/receive antennas and similar wireless applications. Markets for these products include defense, avionics, satellite, and commercial applications including telecom, networking and automotive. The manufacture of these products requires advanced materials, equipment, and methods that are highly specialized and distinct from conventional printed circuit manufacturing techniques. We also offer specialized radio-frequency assembly and test services. We have developed integrated solutions across our facilities and capabilities to provide sophisticated integrated electronics for numerous platforms, ranging from digital RF memory (DRFM) to frequency up/down converters (UDC) and channelized amplifiers for military and space applications.
 High density interconnect or HDI PCBs 
 Our facilities in North America and China also produce high density interconnect (HDI) PCBs, which are PCBs with higher interconnect density per unit area requiring more sophisticated technology and manufacturing processes for their production than conventional PCB products. HDI PCBs are boards with high-density characteristics including micro-sized holes, or microvias (diameter at or less than 0.15 mm), and fine line circuitry (circuit line width and spacing at or less than 0.075 mm) and are fabricated with thin high performance materials, thereby enabling more interconnection functions per unit area. HDI PCBs generally are manufactured using a sequential build-up process in which circuitry is formed in the PCB one layer at a time through successive drilling, plating and lamination cycles. In general, a board’s complexity is a function of interconnect and circuit density, layer count, laminate material type and surface finishes. As electronic devices have become smaller and more portable with higher functionality, demand for advanced HDI PCB products has increased dramatically. We define advanced HDI PCBs as those having more than one layer of microvia interconnection structure. 
 Substrate-like PCBs or SLPs 
 Substrate-like PCBs (SLPs) represent the next evolution of high end HDI PCBs. SLPs are PCBs with even higher interconnect density per unit area than the traditional Advanced HDI PCBs described above and require an even more sophisticated manufacturing technology called modified semi-additive process or mSAP. The mSAP process is adapted from IC substrate fabrication and uses enhancements to the subtractive and additive techniques of traditional PCBs. This enables fine line circuitry (circuit line width and spacing at or less than 0.03 mm). We manufacture SLPs with the mSAP process in our China facilities and the products are generally used in the cellular market which requires high performance in a small footprint. Demand for this type of high-density circuit is beginning to penetrate the markets of more traditional PCBs.
 Flexible PCBs 
 Flexible PCBs are printed circuits produced on flexible films, allowing them to be folded or bent to fit the available space or allowing for application movement. We manufacture circuits on flexible substrates that can be installed in three-dimensional applications for electronic packaging systems. Use of flexible circuitry can enable improved reliability and electrical performance, reduced weight and reduced assembly costs when compared with traditional wire harness or ribbon cable packaging. Flexible PCBs can provide for flexible electronic connectivity of an electrical device’s apparatus such as printer heads, cameras, camcorders, TVs, mobile handsets, and tablets. For some of our flexible PCB customers, we also assemble components onto the flexible PCBs we manufacture. 
 Rigid-flex PCBs 
 Rigid-flex circuitry provides a simple means to integrate multiple PCB assemblies and other elements such as display, input or storage devices without wires, cables or connectors, replacing them with thin, light composites that integrate wiring in ultra-thin, flexible ribbons between rigid sections. In rigid-flex packaging, a flexible circuit substrate provides a backbone of wiring with rigid multilayer circuit sections built up as modules where needed. 
 Since the ribbons can be bent or folded, rigid-flex provides a means to compactly package electronics in three dimensions with dynamic or static bending functions as required, enabling miniaturization and thinness of product design. The simplicity of rigid-flex integration also generally reduces the number of parts and interconnections required, which can improve reliability. The increasing popularity of mobile electronics coupled with the design trend of developing increasingly thinner, lighter and more feature-rich products, is expected to further drive growth in the rigid-flex and flex sectors, where these PCBs are the backbone of miniaturization. 
 Rigid-flex technology is essential to a broad range of applications including aerospace and defense, industrial and transportation systems requiring high reliability; hand-held and wearable electronics such as mobile phones, video cameras and music players where thinness and mechanical articulation are essential; and ultra-miniaturized products such as headsets, medical implants and semiconductor packaging where size and reliability are paramount.

Custom assemblies and system integration 
 Our assembly facilities produce custom electronic assemblies as well as fully integrated electronic systems. Custom electronic assemblies refers to a variety of PCB assemblies such as backplane and midplane assemblies, flexible and rigid-flex assemblies and RF assemblies. Each of these assemblies involves mounting electronic components to a printed circuit board and then testing the assembly for electrical continuity. Our services also go beyond the PCB assembly to fully integrated systems. A fully integrated system often includes installing the PCB assembly into a metal enclosure and adding fans for cooling the system, a power supply and cable assemblies to create a fully assembled and tested system that will be shipped to our customers. 
 IC substrates 
 IC substrates provide the mechanical support and electrical interconnect used to package ICs (integrated circuits or semiconductors) either in single chip packages or multi-chip modules. IC substrates, also known as chip carriers, are highly miniaturized circuits manufactured by a process largely similar to that for PCBs but requiring the use of ultra-thin materials and including micron-scale features, because they must bridge the gap between sub-micron IC features and millimeter scale PCBs. Consequently, IC substrates are generally manufactured in a clean room environment to ensure products are free of defects and contamination and employs advanced HDI processes such as mSAP.
 Passive RF Components
 Our line of products consists of off-the-shelf surface mount microwave components which provide passive microwave signal distribution functions. These products were developed to provide a low-cost high performance signal distribution component, which could be placed on standard printed circuit boards with automated production equipment. The primary applications of these products are in equipment for cellular base stations and in WLAN, Bluetooth, and satellite television. In cellular base stations, our surface mount products are utilized in RF power amplifiers, and are also found in low-noise amplifiers and radios. 
Advanced Ceramic RF Components 
 Our ceramic offerings include standard and etched thick-film ceramic substrates. Etched thick-film ceramic circuits compete favorably with thin-film ceramic circuits in cost while providing comparable performance. These products are generally customer designed in close cooperation with our engineering staff to ensure the highest performance and manufacturability possible. These capabilities are aimed at high performance applications in the medical, industrial, and defense markets. 
 Hi-Reliability Multi-Chip Modules
 We offer custom hybrid and multi-chip modules, high-performance radiation-hardened and space-qualified micro-electronics and power management and control electronics. 
 Beamforming and Switching Networks
 Our beamforming technologies are used in military and aerospace applications, offering a variety of active and passive high-performance RF assemblies, including L-band/LEO and L- and S-band/GEO space beamformers, UHF thru Ka-band radar AESA RF networks, Butler matrices, multi-octave, and more.
 Quick turnaround services 
 We refer to our rapid delivery services as “quick turnaround” or “QTA”, because we provide custom-fabricated PCBs to our customers within as little as 24 hours to ten days. As a result of our ability to rapidly and reliably respond to the critical time requirements of our customers, we generally receive premium pricing for our QTA services as compared to standard lead time prices. 
  
• | Prototype production. In the design, testing, and launch phase of a new electronic product’s life cycle, our customers typically require limited quantities of PCBs in a very short period of time. We satisfy this need by manufacturing prototype PCBs in small quantities, with delivery times ranging from as little as 24 hours to ten days. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ramp-to-volume production. After a product has successfully completed the prototype phase, our customers introduce the product to the market and require larger quantities of PCBs in a short period of time. This transition stage between low-volume prototype production and volume production is known as ramp-to-volume. Our ramp-to-volume services typically include manufacturing up to a few hundred PCBs per order with delivery times ranging from five to 15 days. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thermal management 
 Increased component density on circuit boards often requires improved thermal dissipation to reduce operating temperatures. We produce printed circuits with heavy copper cores and both embedded and press-fit coins. In addition, we produce PCBs with electrically passive heat sinks laminated externally on a circuit board or between two circuit boards, as well as PCBs with electrically active thermal cores. 
 7


Manufacturing Technologies 
 The market for our products is characterized by rapidly evolving technology. In recent years, the trend in the electronic products industry has been to increase the speed, complexity, and performance of components while reducing their size. We believe our technological capabilities allow us to address the needs of manufacturers to bring complicated electronic products to market faster. 
 To manufacture PCBs, we generally receive circuit designs directly from our customers in the form of computer data files, which we review to ensure data accuracy and product manufacturability. Processing these data files with computer aided manufacturing (CAM) technology, we generate images of the circuit patterns that we then physically develop on individual layers, using advanced photographic and direct imaging processes. Through a variety of plating and etching processes, we selectively add and remove conductive materials to form horizontal layers of thin circuitry, which are separated by electrical insulating material. A multilayer circuit board is produced by laminating together multiple layers of circuitry, using intense heat and pressure under vacuum. Vertical connections between layers are achieved by drilling and plating through small holes, called vias. Vias are made by highly specialized drilling equipment capable of achieving extremely fine tolerances with high accuracy. We specialize in high layer count PCBs with extremely fine geometries and tolerances. Because of the tolerances involved, we employ clean rooms in certain manufacturing processes where tiny particles might otherwise create defects on the circuit patterns. We also use automated optical inspection systems and electrical testing systems to ensure consistent quality of the circuits we produce. 
 We believe that our highly specialized equipment and advanced manufacturing processes enable us to reliably produce PCBs with the following characteristics: 
  
• | High layer count. Manufacturing PCBs with a large number of layers is difficult to accomplish due to the accumulation of manufacturing tolerances and registration systems required. In our PCB reportable segment, we regularly manufacture PCBs with more than 30 layers on a quick-turn and volume basis. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Blind and buried vias. Vias are drilled holes that provide electrical connectivity between layers of circuitry in a PCB. Blind vias connect the surface layer of the PCB to an internal layer and terminate at the internal layer. Buried vias are holes that do not reach either surface of the PCB but allow inner layers to be interconnected. Products with blind and buried vias can be made thinner, smaller, lighter and with higher component density and more functionality than products with traditional vias. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Microvias. HDI technology utilizes microvias, which are small vias with diameters generally less than 0.15 mm after plating. Advanced HDI products may also require the microvias to be fully filled using a specialized plating process so that additional microvia structures can be stacked to form more complex interconnections. These microvias consume much less space on the layers they connect, thereby providing for greater wiring densities and flexibility, and also providing closer spacing of components and their attachment pads. The fabrication of PCBs with microvias requires specialized equipment, such as laser drills, and highly developed process knowledge. Applications such as handheld wireless devices employ microvias to obtain a higher degree of functionality from a given surface area. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Embedded passives. Embedded passive technology involves embedding either capacitive or resistive elements inside the PCB, which allows for removal of passive components from the surface of the PCB and thereby leaves more surface area for active components. Use of this technology provides greater surface area for surface-mounted ICs and better signal performance, as well as increased functionality of products with higher component density. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fine line traces and spaces. Traces are the connecting copper lines between the different components of the PCB, and spaces are the distances between traces. The smaller the traces and the tighter the spaces, the higher the density of the PCB and the greater the expertise required to achieve a desired final yield performance level. We are able to manufacture PCBs with traces and spaces less than 0.030 mm. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High aspect ratios. The aspect ratio is the ratio between the thickness of the PCB and the diameter of a drilled hole. As the aspect ratio increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to consistently and reliably form, electroplate and finish all the holes on a PCB. In production, we are able to provide aspect ratios of up to 30:1. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Thin core processing. A core is the basic inner-layer building block material from which PCBs are constructed. A core consists of a flat sheet of material comprised of glass-reinforced resin with copper foil laminated on either side. The thickness of inner-layer cores is typically determined by the overall thickness of the PCB and the number of layers required. The demand for thinner cores derives from the requirements for thinner PCBs, higher layer counts and various electrical parameters. Core thickness in our PCBs ranges from as little as 0.025 mm up to 1.57 mm. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advanced hole fill processes. Our advanced hole fill processes provide designers the opportunity to increase the density of component placements by reducing the surface area required to place many types of components. In traditional design, components are routed from their surface interfaces through via connections in order to access power and ground connections and the internal circuitry used to connect to other discrete components. Our advanced hole fill processes provide methods to allow for vias to be placed inside their respective surface mount pads by filling the vias with a thermoset epoxy and plating flat copper surface mount pads directly over the filled hole. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Advanced materials. We manufacture circuit boards using a wide variety of advanced dielectric materials. These high-performance materials offer electrical, thermal, and long-term reliability advantages over conventional materials but are more difficult to manufacture. We are certified by Underwriters Laboratories to manufacture PCBs using many types and combinations of these specialty materials. This broad offering allows us to manufacture PCBs for a wide array of end-use applications, including highly complex PCBs for niche and high-end commercial and aerospace and defense markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quick Turn Manufacturing. In addition, in circumstances where our customers require time critical engineering and manufacturing services, we are able to meet our customers’ need with our quick-turn manufacturing capabilities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our RF Engineering organization principally designs and manufactures state-of-the-art microwave-based hardware for use in advanced radar systems, advanced jamming systems, missiles and decoys, electronic surveillance systems and satellite and ground based communication systems.

• | Analog Hybrid Module Technology. Analog Hybrid Modules are assembled in our Microelectronics Center of Excellence, which is certified to MIL-PRF-38534 and -38535 Class H and Class K. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art equipment for precision microelectronic assembly processes including custom ceramic substrate manufacturing, eutectic die attach, automated epoxy dispense, wire bonding, lid attach and lead forming. All parts are electrically tested for performance and subjected to environmental testing as may be required. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ceramic Technology. Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) circuits are well-suited for high performance RF packages for multi-function applications such as transmit-receive modules or other RF integrated modules. We developed proprietary processes to allow for the use of less expensive conductors (Silver vs. traditional Gold) in the LTCC product thus providing significantly lower cost options to our customers. We developed a proprietary etched thick film process resulting in thin film performance at a much reduced cost. We recently deployed customized equipment to support automated test, visual and electrical inspection, and final tape-and-reel for ceramic resistor products significantly reducing cost and enhancing product quality.

 Sales attributable to our five largest OEM customers, which can vary from year to year, collectively accounted for 32%, 37%, and 33%, of our net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our five largest OEM customers in 2018 were, in alphabetical order, Apple Inc., Collins Aerospace, Huawei Technology Co. Ltd., Raytheon Company and Robert Bosch GmbH. For the fiscal year 2018, Apple accounted for 15% of our net sales. Sales attributed to OEMs include sales made through EMS providers. Sales to EMS providers comprised approximately 37%, 32%, and 35% of our net sales in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although our contractual relationships are with the EMS companies, we typically negotiate price and volume requirements directly with the OEMs. In addition, we are on the approved vendor lists of several of our EMS providers. This positions us to participate in business that is awarded at the discretion of the EMS provider. 
 Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on building long-term relationships with our customers’ engineering and new product introduction personnel early in the product development phase, frequently through strategic account management teams. Traditional build to print opportunities involve TTM engineering with design for manufacture reviews and recommendations for both manufacturability and cost without impacting specifications. Prototype builds to verify design ensue, along with the early stages of production. As the product then matures from the prototype stage to volume production, we shift our focus to the customers’ procurement departments in order to capture sales at each point in the product’s life cycle. The addition of Anaren’s design to specification capabilities allows us to engage at the onset in the engineering cycle at critical aerospace and defense, automotive, telecom, and networking customers as they begin the process of specifying an RF requirement. At that stage, we are able to support our customers by designing a complete or specific portions of an RF solution as well as providing early prototyping and test support for that solution. TTM will then provide the ramp to volume and volume production requirements for our customers.
 Our staff of engineers, sales support personnel, and managers assists our sales representatives in advising customers with respect to manufacturing feasibility, design review, and technological capabilities through direct communication and visits. We combine our sales efforts with customer service personnel at each facility to better serve our customers. Each large customer is typically assigned an account manager to coordinate all of the Company’s services across all of our facilities. Additionally, the largest and most strategic customers are also supported by select program management and engineering teams. Our global sales force is comprised of direct sales personnel, complemented by commission-based independent representatives, and supports customers throughout North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. 
 Our North America footprint comprises a significant amount of our PCB reportable segment with seventeen PCB fabrication plants located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Ontario, Canada. The footprint includes two facilities that provide follow-on value-added services.

 Suppliers 
 The primary raw materials we use in PCB manufacturing include copper-clad laminate, chemical solutions such as copper and gold for plating operations, photographic film, carbide drill bits, and plastic for testing fixtures. Although we have preferred suppliers for some raw materials used in the manufacture of PCBs, most of our raw materials are generally readily available in the open market from numerous other potential suppliers. 
 The primary raw materials we use in RF components, RF subsystems, backplane assemblies and other PCB assemblies are manufactured components such as PCBs, ceramic and ferrite substrates, connectors, capacitors, resistors, diodes and integrated circuits, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers’ approved vendors. The more complicated RF subsystems may require us to purchase integrated sub-assemblies and super-components such as RF Oscillators, Frequency Converters, Power Supplies and Microprocessors. These components for backplane assemblies and other PCB assemblies in some cases have limited or sole sources of supply. For example, in some instances, our customers will require us to use a specific component from a particular supplier or require us to use a component provided by the customer itself, in which case we may have a single or limited number of suppliers for these specific components. The backplane assemblies, PCB assemblies and precision metal fabricated chassis and enclosures produced by us may be incorporated into a fully integrated and tested system delivered to our customer. These products often incorporate procured power, thermal, interconnect and mechanical components sourced from customer directed or our selected suppliers. 
 We typically use just-in-time procurement practices to maintain our raw materials inventory at low levels and work closely with our suppliers to obtain technologically advanced raw materials. In addition, we periodically seek alternative supply sources to ensure that we are receiving competitive pricing and service. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and we believe this availability will continue into the foreseeable future. 
 Competition 
 Despite industry consolidation, the PCB industry remains fragmented and characterized by intense competition. There are several competitive factors our customers consider when choosing their supplier including, but not limited to, technical capabilities, pricing, service, support, reliability, and quality production. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include AT&S (Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik AG), Chin Poon Industrial Co., Ltd., Compeq Manufacturing Co., Ltd., IBIDEN Co., Ltd., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Multek Corporation, Sanmina Corporation, Tripod Technology Corp., Unimicron Technology Corp., and Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd. Our principal E-M Solutions competitors include Amphenol Corporation, Flex, Jabil, Inc. and Sanmina Corporation. Our competition for RF products include Cobham, Crane, TRM Microwave, Mercury Systems, AVX, Molex, and Smiths. 
 We believe that our key competitive strengths include: 
 Leading global PCB manufacturer.    We are one of the largest and most diversified PCB manufacturers in the world and enjoy significant economies of scale, with net sales of $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018. The PCB industry is highly fragmented with the top 20 PCB providers comprising approximately 51% of market share in 2017, according to NTI. As our customers consolidate their supply base, we offer the technology breadth and scale to emerge as a preferred partner. 
 Breadth of technology and products.     We offer a wide range of PCB and RF products as well as electro-mechanical solutions, including HDI PCBs, conventional PCBs, flexible PCBs, rigid-flex PCBs, custom assemblies, passive RF components, advanced ceramic RF components, hi-reliability multi-chip modules, beamforming and switching networks, and integrated circuit (IC) substrates. We also offer certain value-added services to support our customers’ needs. These include RF design to specification capability, design for manufacturability (DFM), PCB layout design, simulation and testing services, and QTA services. By providing these value-added services to customers, we are able to provide our customers with a “one-stop” manufacturing solution, which we believe enhances our relationships with our customers. 
 Diversified business model.    Our sales are diversified by a well-balanced portfolio of end markets which we serve and by the customers we sell to within those end markets. We believe this diversity reduces our exposure to, and reliance on, any single end market or customer. We enjoy a large and diverse customer base with over 2,200 customers, as well as long-term relationships in excess of ten years with our ten largest customers. For fiscal 2018, net sales to our top five customers represented approximately 32% of our total net sales. Furthermore, for fiscal 2018, our largest five customers are not concentrated in any single end market, but rather are represented across four of our end markets. 
 11


Focused on attractive end markets with a favorable growth outlook and dependence on sophisticated product capabilities.    We believe that our global manufacturing footprint and breadth of capabilities enables us to serve several key end markets for the PCB industry. The automotive industry in particular provides an opportunity for us as we combine our traditional market strength in core automotive engine controls with the advanced technologies and RF capabilities we offer for growing requirements in safety systems, automated driving and infotainment. 
 One-stop solution for customers.    We are capable of providing a one-stop manufacturing solution to our customers from engineering support and prototype development through final volume production around the globe. This one-stop manufacturing solution allows us to better serve our customers, many of whom are based in time-critical high growth markets, enabling our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market. We utilize a facility specialization strategy in which each customer is directed to the facility best suited to the customer’s product type, delivery time, complexity and volume needs, which enables us to reduce the time from order placement to delivery. As our customers ramp to volume, we are positioned to seamlessly transition them to one of our volume facilities in China. 
 Leading aerospace and defense supplier.    We provide the aerospace and defense industry with products in North America from our broad North American footprint. We have passed OEM and government certification processes, and administrative requirements associated with participation in government and commercial aerospace programs. When supplying various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, we are required to maintain facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual and International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Along with supply of traditional and RF PCBs, we offer a variety of RF components and sub-assemblies, as well as our engineering services and assembly capabilities which allow us to bring additional value to our customers. 
 Seasonality 
 Orders for our products generally correspond to the production schedules of our customers. We historically experience higher net sales in the third and fourth quarters due to end customer demand in the fourth quarter for consumer electronics products. Seasonal fluctuations also include the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter, which typically results in lower net sales. We attribute this decline to shutdowns of our customers’ and our own China based manufacturing facilities surrounding the Chinese New Year public holidays, which normally occur in January or February of each year. 
Backlog 
 Backlog consists of purchase orders received, including, in some instances, demand agreements released for production under customer contracts. We obtain firm purchase orders from our customers for all products. However, for some of these purchase orders, customers do not make firm schedules for delivery more than 90 days in advance. Therefore, we measure backlog as orders with deliveries scheduled over the next 90 days. At December 31, 2018, total backlog was $458.4 million, compared with $481.9 million at the end of 2017. Substantially all backlog at December 31, 2018 is expected to be converted to sales in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we typically experience a higher amount of backlog in the second half of the year due to increased end customer demand for consumer electronics products in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with our seasonal patterns as discussed above. 
Intellectual Property 
 The Anaren business that we acquired designs and manufactures products for its existing customer base and also designs off-the-shelf products for the customers we serve. With the Anaren acquisition, we acquired an additional thirty-six patents to complement our existing patent portfolio. Because our PCB business depends on the effectiveness of our fabrication techniques, proprietary PCB structures, and our ability to continually improve our manufacturing processes, we have strategically limited patent and trade secret protection for our PCB products and manufacturing processes relative to our size as a company. We rely on the collective experience of our employees in the manufacturing process to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies available within our industry. In addition, we depend on robust training, recruiting, and retention of our employees, who are required to be knowledgeable in the operation of advanced equipment and complicated manufacturing processes. In regards to our RF products, the vast majority are proprietary and protected or covered by thirty-six patents and eleven currently pending patent applications directed towards products for both the wireless infrastructure and aerospace and defense markets. Following the Anaren acquisition, we now have a total of 112 patents.
National Security Matters 
 A portion of our business consists of manufacturing defense and defense-related items for various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which requires that we maintain facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, or NISPOM. The NISPOM requires that a corporation with significant foreign ownership maintaining a facility security clearance take steps to prevent foreign control or influence, referred to as “FOCI.” Pursuant to these laws and regulations, effective October 2010, we entered into a Special Security Agreement (SSA) with the DoD; Su Sih (BVI) Limited, or Su Sih (a foreign owner of our capital stock), and Mr. Tang Hsiang Chien (as the beneficial owner of Su Sih). At that time, Su Sih owned approximately 35% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock. The purpose of the SSA 
 12


is to deny Mr. Tang, Su Sih, and other persons affiliated with our China operations, unauthorized access to classified and export controlled unclassified information and to mitigate any influence over our business or management in a manner that could result in the compromise of classified information or could adversely affect the performance of classified contracts. As of December 31, 2018, Su Sih owned approximately 5.9% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock.

 The process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to domestic and foreign environmental regulations regarding the storage, use, handling, recycling, and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards and chemical use reporting. We believe that our facilities in the United States and Canada comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. In China, governmental authorities have adopted new rules and regulations governing environmental issues. Our plants in China are not yet in full compliance with the newly adopted environmental regulations. We have developed plans in response to the new regulation and we are in the process of implementing these plans. We have established and enacted an investment plan related to the efforts to come into full compliance with the new regulations. There can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 27,000 employees. Of our employees, approximately 25,100 were involved in manufacturing and engineering, 690 worked in sales and marketing, and approximately 1,210 worked in accounting, information systems and other support capacities. None of our North American employees are represented by unions. In China, approximately 18,000 employees are members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and accordingly are considered to be represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any labor problems resulting in a work stoppage and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
