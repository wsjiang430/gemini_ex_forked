Business.

Overview

Basanite, Inc. (Basanite or the Company, we, us, or our)), a Nevada corporation, is a company organized on May 30, 2006. In 2017, the Company acquired Basalt America, LLC (Basalt America), a business dedicated to the production of reinforcement products made of basalt fiber for the construction industry. During 2018, the Company formed Basanite Industries, LLC (Basanite Industries) and intends to continue its reinforcement business through that company going forward. On December 19, 2018, the Company changed its name from PayMeOn, Inc. to Basanite, Inc. to more accurately reflect the new direction of the Company.

Prior to entering the reinforcement business, the Company had conducted business through two separate wholly-owned subsidiaries: HLM Paymeon, Inc., and Paymeon Brands, Inc. On March 19, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the disposal of HLM Paymeon, Inc. and Paymeon Brands, Inc. as the Company continued its strategic shift into the basalt fiber reinforcements business through Basalt America. The disposal of HLM Paymeon, Inc. and Paymeon Brands, Inc. was effective September 30, 2018. As a result of this disposal under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20-45-1E, the Company has presented the assets and liabilities of this segment as held for sale and as discontinued operations and have reclassified the prior year balances to reflect this strategic shift.

Basalt America has an exclusive license with Global Energy Sciences (through an assignment by RAW Energy Materials Corp. (RAW) for the exclusive production and sales of certain trademarked concrete reinforcement products (RAW License Agreement). In October 2018, Basalt America and affiliates of Global Energy Sciences entered litigation over various contractual disputes. This license agreement was terminated on January 29, 2019. The Company does not feel the cancellation will have a material effect on its new direction. The Company is pursuing litigation against RAW in a countersuit, attempting to recover amounts paid for license fees and payments for machinery, raw materials and inventory. While litigation is ongoing, the Company will continue to pursue the basalt fiber reinforcement business through the production of its own proprietary basalt fiber reinforcement products through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Basanite Industries. The Company has equipped itself with new personnel, new and different equipment, new proprietary resin matrices and products; all outside of any relationship or knowledge associated with the License, to establish its successful market entry through its wholly owned subsidiary Basanite Industries, LLC.

As of December 31, 2018, as a result of the failure to amicably settle its disagreements with RAW, the Company has written off or impaired the following amounts: $1,200,000 in deposits paid towards machinery and equipment that were never received; $60,000 for deposits on materials that have not been received; $395,742 in net machinery and equipment as the Company determined the machinery and equipment purchased and received was in poor condition and could not manufacture and produce the rebar in accordance with Company and industry standards; and inventory obsolescence of $240,121 as the inventory received and paid for in the initial purchase from RAW was in poor condition and unable to be sold. 

Chronology

Historically, Basanite owned and operated products aimed at monetizing consumer influence through social, local and mobile marketing. The Company endeavored to apply its products to various businesses it entered from 2014 to 2016, including the manufacture and retail sales of electric bicycles and related products, and the sale and distribution of lifestyle brand products, including apparel. Brief descriptions of the businesses the Company engaged in are included below:

On July 18, 2014, Basanite acquired a 19.4% stake in Prodeco Technologies, LLC, a USA-based researcher, developer, marketer, and manufacturer of quality electric bicycles and entered the business of selling light electric vehicles and related products through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HLM Paymeon, Inc. In September 2014, HLM Paymeon began selling ProdecoTech electric bicycles online under a non-exclusive dealer agreement.

In October 2015, HLM Paymeon launched a retail store located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to sell ProdecoTech and other electric bicycles, as well as other alternative transportation products (such as hoverboards) and related products and accessories at our retail location. Effective November 18, 2016, the Company assigned all of its interests in Prodeco Technologies, LLC, held by Ebike, LLC and A Better Bike, LLC to Tavone Family Holdings, LLC in consideration of a total cash payment of $30,000 pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated November 18, 2016. The Company owned its Prodeco Technologies LLC interests through its 100% ownership of Ebike, LLC and A Better Bike, LLC. The Company sold its interests as part of its changing focus. The Company discontinued its light electric vehicles business and shifted its primary focus to its Basalt America business.

In March 2016, the Company formed Paymeon Brands, Inc to develop, market, manage and monetize lifestyle brands and products. It was the Companys intention to acquire exclusive licensing rights to brands that were expandable to additional product lines. In addition, Paymeon Brands sought to develop or acquire its own products, which were not yet known brands, but that it believed were in substantial growth markets and could become lifestyle oriented brands.

On December 15, 2016, a third-party driver drove his car through the companys retail storefront located at 2599 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33305. The accident caused severe damage to the building. The city of Fort Lauderdale declared the building an unsafe structure, and the Company had to vacate the premises and as a result, the lease terminated. This incident severely impacted our ability to sell to and service our customers. The damaged storefront eliminated sales at the location and effectively terminated the business. The Company is pursuing a claim for the damages sustained for lost sales and the writing off of the leasehold improvements at the location. The company is presently in suit for all damages suffered. The court has ordered that a mediation take place no later than April 7, 2019. The case is set for a jury trial and is set on the three-week trial docket beginning June 10, 2019.

While the Company is optimistic of a recovery, there can be no assurances as to the result of the suit.

In February 2017, we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Basalt America. Basalt America licensed intellectual property, technology and processes to produce Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer products that are used as replacements for steel products that reinforce concrete such as rebar. The RAW License Agreement was terminated on January 29, 2019. The Company does not feel that the cancellation will materially affect the Company and its new direction. The Company is pursuing litigation against RAW in a countersuit, attempting to recover amounts paid under the agreement.

During the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a term sheet for a Joint Venture (Joint Venture) with accredited investors for the management of Basalt America Territory 1, LLC, which will have the exclusive rights to manage sales for Dade, Broward and Monroe Counties in the State of Florida. In conjunction with entering into the Joint Venture, the investors provided total proceeds of $502,500 which was used as a deposit to purchase future inventory from May to August 2017. Operations commenced during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company owns 55.3% of the Joint Venture and the investors own 44.7% of the joint venture.

On February 12, 2019, as a result of the termination of the RAW License Agreement, the Company agreed to settle with the non-controlling investors in Basalt America Territory 1, LLC to unwind this investment. In the settlement, the Company agreed to issue 2,010,000 restricted common shares at a value representing the original investment of $502,500 ($0.25 per share). The non-controlling investors were issued these shares on March 21, 2019 and the Company will take control of the previous 44.7% of Basalt America Territory 1, LLC formerly representing the non-controlling interest as of December 31, 2018 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

As mentioned above, the Company and affiliates of Global Energy Sciences and RAW Materials Corp entered litigation during October 2018. 

In July 2018, the Company formed Basanite Industries, LLC to continue its pursuit of the basalt fiber reinforcement business through the manufacture of its own proprietary products. Basanite Industries, LLC is the main operating business of the Company today.

Information that appears on any of our websites is not part of this report.

Competition

The market for the manufacture and sale of construction related products is one of the largest markets in the world. Basalt fiber concrete reinforcement products are sold as alternatives to steel reinforcement products. Accordingly, our business competes with large, established steel companies that have large and established wholesale and retail distribution networks. Most of our competitors are large and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than our company. We also compete with other manufacturers of products often marketed as alternatives to steel, including manufacturers of fiberglass, and other types of fiber products. Many of these players also have substantially greater resources than our company.

While we believe that our products are unique and create a new segment within the concrete reinforcement industry, we still expect to compete with these large companies, both inside and outside of the United States, as they aggressively market their existing products, as well as any new products they may be developing that are competitive to ours.

Intellectual Property

The process of manufacturing basalt fiber reinforcement products for the construction industry often involves proprietary formulations of chemicals, as well as proprietary processes. The Company intends to aggressively pursue protection of any intellectual property it develops, as well as any intellectual property it already owns or to which it has rights.

The Company owns the term social income® as a registered trademark of PayMeOn. Additionally, we have applied for registration of various trademarks related to Basalt America. We currently have not applied for any other U.S. trademarks and, except for common law rights, we currently do not hold any other intellectual property rights on the products we have developed, though we are continually in the process of evaluating assets the Company owns or is developing that are proprietary and in need of intellectual property protection. In addition to our trademarks and trademark applications, we have secured various domain names related to our business.

Governmental Regulation

Products previously sold by Basalt America and those that will be sold by Basanite Industries are subject to various approvals and certifications from various private and public entities at both the state and federal levels such as the Department of Transportation and the US Army Corps of Engineers. Such approvals and certifications are based on numerous, often changing standards and there can be no assurance that our products will receive or retain necessary approvals or certifications in the future.
