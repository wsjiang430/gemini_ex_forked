Significant Transactions
Banc Home Loans Sale
On March 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of specific assets and activities related to its Banc Home Loans division to Caliber Home Loans, Inc. (Caliber). The Banc Home Loans division largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment, the activities of which related to originating, servicing, underwriting, funding and selling residential mortgage loans. Assets sold to Caliber included mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on certain conventional agency residential mortgage loans. The Banc Home Loans division, along with certain other mortgage banking related assets and liabilities that were to be sold or settled separately within one year, is classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain components of the Company’s Mortgage Banking segment, including MSRs on certain conventional government single family residential (SFR) mortgage loans that were not sold as part of the Banc Home Loans sale and the repurchase reserves related to previously sold loans, have been classified as continuing operations in the financial statements as they remain part of the Company’s ongoing operations.
The Company received a $25.0 million cash premium payment, in addition to the net book value of certain assets acquired by Caliber, totaling $2.5 million, upon the closing of the transaction. Caliber also purchased the MSRs of $37.8 million on approximately $3.86 billion in unpaid balances of conventional agency mortgage loans, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The entire transaction resulted in a net gain on disposal of $15.2 million in total for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Additionally, the Company could receive an earn-out, payable quarterly, based on future performance over the 38 months following completion of the transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized earn-out payments of $2.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Since the completion of the transaction, the Company has recognized a total earn-out of $4.0 million in Income from Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Caliber retains an option to buy out the future earn-out payable to the Company for cash consideration of $35.0 
4

million, less the aggregate amount of all earn-out payments made prior to the date on which Caliber pays the buyout amount. For additional information, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Lending Activities
General
The Company offers a number of commercial and consumer loan products including commercial and industrial loans; commercial real estate loans; multifamily loans; construction and renovation loans; SFR mortgage loans; warehouse loans; asset, insurance or security-backed loans; home equity lines of credit (HELOCs); consumer and business lines of credit; and other consumer loans.
Legal lending limits are calculated in conformance with OCC regulations, which prohibit a national bank from lending to any one individual or entity or its related interests on any amount that exceeds 15 percent of a bank’s capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 percent of a bank’s capital and surplus, if the amount that exceeds a bank’s 15 percent general limit is fully secured by readily marketable collateral. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s authorized legal lending limits for loans to one borrower were $168.0 million for unsecured loans and an additional $112.0 million for specific secured loans.
At December 31, 2018, the Company's total loans and leases held-for-investment and loans held-for-sale were $7.70 billion or 72.4 percent of total assets and $8.1 million or 0.1 percent of total assets, respectively, compared to $6.66 billion or 64.5 percent of total assets and $67.1 million or 0.6 percent of total assets at December 31, 2017, respectively. For additional information concerning changes in loans and leases, see "Loans and Leases Receivable, Net" and "Loans Held-for-Sale" included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risk Governance
The Company conducts its business activities under a system of risk governance controls. Key elements of the Company's risk governance structure include the risk appetite framework and risk appetite statement. The risk appetite framework adopted by the Company has been developed in conjunction with the Company’s strategic and capital plans. The strategic and capital plans articulate the Board of Director's (Board's) approved statement of financial condition, loan concentration targets and the appropriate level of capital to manage our risks properly.
The risk appetite framework includes policies, procedures, controls, and systems through which the risk appetite is established, communicated, and monitored. The risk appetite framework utilizes a risk assessment process to identify inherent risks across the Company, gauges the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls, and establishes tolerances for residual risk in each of the following risk categories: strategic, reputational, earnings, capital, liquidity, asset quality (credit), market, operational, people, and diversification/concentration. Each risk category is assigned a qualitative statement as well as specific, measurable, risk metrics. The risk metrics have variance thresholds established which indicate whether the metric is within tolerance or at variance to plan. Variances are reported regularly to both executive management and to the Board and require remediation measures or risk acceptance, as appropriate.
The risk appetite framework includes a risk appetite statement, risk limits, and an outline of roles and responsibilities of those overseeing the implementation and monitoring of the framework. The risk appetite statement is an expression of the maximum level of residual risk that the Company is prepared to accept in order to achieve the Company's business objectives. Defining, communicating, and monitoring risk appetite are fundamental to a safe and sound control environment and a risk-focused culture. The Board of Directors establishes the Company’s strategic objectives and approves the Company’s risk appetite statement, which is developed in collaboration with the Company's executive leadership. The executive team translates the Board-approved strategic objectives and the risk appetite statement into targets and constraints for business lines and legal entities to follow.
The risk appetite framework is supported by an enterprise risk management program. Enterprise risk management at the Company and Bank integrates all risk efforts under one common framework. Key elements of enterprise risk management that are intended to support prudent lending activities include:

• | Policies—The Company's loan policy articulates the credit culture of the Company's lending business and provides clarity around encouraged and discouraged lending activities. Additional policies cover key business segments of the portfolio (for example, the Company's Commercial Real Estate Policy) and other important aspects supporting the Bank's lending activities (for example, policies relating to appraisals, risk ratings, fair lending, etc.).


• | Credit Approval Authorities—All material credit exposures of the Company are approved by a credit risk management group that is independent of the business units with the exception of SFR mortgage loans that have been provided delegated authority within the approved credit policy. Above this threshold, credit approvals are made by the chief credit officer or an executive management credit committee of the Bank. The joint credit and enterprise risk committees of the Company's Board of Directors and the Bank's Board of Directors review and approve material loan pool purchases, divestitures, and any other transactions as appropriate.


• | Concentration Risk Management Policy—To mitigate and manage the risk within the Company's loan portfolio, the Board of Directors of the Bank adopted a concentration risk management policy, pursuant to which it expects to review and revise concentration risk to tolerance thresholds at least annually and otherwise from time to time as appropriate. It is anticipated that these concentration risk to tolerance thresholds may change at any time when the Board of Directors is considering material strategic initiatives such as acquisitions, new product launches and terminations of products or other factors as the Board of Directors believes appropriate. The Company has developed procedures relating to the appropriate actions to be taken should management seek to increase the concentration guidelines or exceed the guideline maximum based on various factors. Concentration risk to tolerance thresholds are intended to aid management and the Board to ensure that the loan concentrations are consistent with the Board’s risk appetite.


• | Stress Testing—The Company has developed a stress test policy and stress testing methodology as a tool to evaluate our loan portfolio, capital levels and strategic plan with the objective of ensuring that our loan portfolio and balance sheet concentrations are consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite and strategic and capital plans.


• | Loan Portfolio Management—The Company has an internal asset review committee that formally reviews the loan portfolio on a regular basis. Risk rating trends, loan portfolio performance, including delinquency status, and the resolution of problem assets are reviewed and evaluated.


• | Commercial Real Estate Loan Pricing, Multifamily Loan Pricing and Residential Loan Pricing—Regular discussions occur between the areas of executive management, Treasury, Capital Markets, Credit and Risk Management and the business units with regard to the pricing of the Company's loan products. These groups meet to ensure that the Company is pricing its products appropriately and consistently with the Company's strategic and capital plans.

Commercial and Industrial Loans
Commercial and industrial loans are made to finance operations, provide working capital, finance the purchase of fixed assets, equipment or real property, business acquisitions and warehousing lending. A borrower’s cash flow from operations is generally the primary source of repayment. Accordingly, the Company's policies provide specific guidelines regarding debt coverage and other financial ratios. Commercial and industrial loans include lines of credit, commercial term loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans. Commercial lines of credit are extended to businesses generally to finance operations, working capital needs and finance mortgage loans. Commercial term loans are typically made to finance the acquisition of fixed assets, refinance short-term debt originally used to purchase fixed assets or make business acquisitions. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are extended to purchase or refinance real property and are usually 50 percent or more occupied by the underlying business and the business's cash flow is the primary source of repayment.
Commercial and industrial loans are extended based on the financial strength and integrity of the borrower and guarantor(s) and are generally collateralized by the borrower's assets such as mortgage loans, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or real estate and typically have a term of 1-5 years.
Commercial and industrial loans may be unsecured, for well-capitalized and highly profitable borrowers. The interest rates on these loans generally are adjustable and usually are indexed to The Wall Street Journal’s prime rate (Prime Rate) or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and will vary based on market conditions and be commensurate to the perceived credit risk. Where it can be negotiated, loans are written with a floor rate of interest. Some of the owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be fixed for periods of up to 10 years and many have prepayment penalties. Commercial and industrial loans generally are made to businesses that have had profitable operations, and have a conservative debt-to-net worth ratio, good payment histories as evidenced by credit reports, acceptable working capital, and operating cash flow sufficient to demonstrate the ability to pay obligations as they become due.
The Company’s commercial and industrial loan policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower’s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower’s capital and collateral as well as an evaluation of global conditions affecting the borrower and the industry in which they participate. Detailed analysis of the borrower’s past, present and future cash flow is also an important aspect of the credit analysis, as it is the Company's primary source of repayment. In addition, commercial and industrial loans are typically monitored periodically to provide an early warning for deteriorating cash flow. All commercial and industrial loans must have well-defined primary and secondary or, at times, tertiary sources of repayment.
In order to mitigate the risk of borrower default, the Company generally requires collateral to support the credit and, in the case of loans made to businesses, personal guarantees from their owners. The Company attempts to control the risk by generally requiring loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of not more than 80 percent (owner occupied commercial real estate loans are typically 75 percent or less if SBA loans) and by regularly monitoring the amount and value of the collateral in order to maintain that ratio. However, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Because of the potential value reduction, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself, which, in turn, is often dependent, in part, upon general economic conditions. See “Asset Quality” under "Loans and Leases Receivable, Net" included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Commercial and industrial loan growth also assists in the growth of the Company's deposits because many commercial and industrial loan borrowers establish deposit accounts and treasury banking services relationships. Those deposit accounts help the Company to reduce the overall cost of funds and those banking service relationships provide a source of noninterest fee income.
Commercial Real Estate and Multifamily Loans
Commercial real estate and multifamily loans are secured primarily by multifamily dwellings, industrial/warehouse buildings, anchored and non-anchored retail centers, office buildings and, on a limited basis, hospitality properties primarily located in the Company’s market area.
The Company’s loans secured by commercial real estate and multifamily properties are originated with either a fixed or an adjustable interest rate. The interest rate on adjustable rate loans is based on a variety of indices, generally determined through negotiation with the borrower. LTV ratios on these loans typically do not exceed 75 percent of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. These loans typically require monthly payments, may contain balloon payments and generally have maturities of 15 years with maximum maturities of 30 years for multifamily loans and 10 years for commercial real estate loans.
7

Loans secured by commercial real estate and multifamily properties are underwritten based on the income producing potential of the property and the financial strength of the borrower and/or guarantor. The net operating income, which is the income derived from the operation of the property less all operating expenses, must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt. The Company generally requires an assignment of rents or leases in order to be assured that the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate and multifamily loans are performed by independent state licensed appraisers approved by management. In order to monitor the adequacy of cash flows on income-producing properties, the borrower is generally required to provide periodic financial information. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate and multifamily properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. See “Asset Quality” under "Loans and Leases Receivable, Net" included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Small Business Administration Loans
The Company provides numerous SBA loan products through the Bank. The Bank’s Preferred Lender Program status generally gives it the authority to make the final credit decision and have most servicing and liquidation authority. The Company provides the following SBA products:

• | 7(a)—These loans provide the Bank with a guarantee from the SBA for up to 85 percent of the loan amount for loans up to $150,000 and 75 percent of the loan amount for loans of more than $150,000, with a maximum loan amount of $5 million. These are term loans that can be used for a variety of purposes including business acquisition, working capital, expansion, renovation, new construction, and equipment purchases. Depending on collateral, these loans can have terms ranging from 7 to 25 years. The guaranteed portion of these loans is often sold into the secondary market.


• | Cap Lines—In general, these lines are guaranteed up to 75 percent and are typically used for working capital purposes and secured by accounts receivable and/or inventory. These lines are generally allowed in amounts up to $5 million and can be issued with maturities of up to 5 years.


• | 504 Loans—These are real estate loans in which the lender can advance up to 90 percent of the purchase price; retain 50 percent as a first trust deed; and have a Certified Development Company (CDC) retain the second trust deed for 40 percent of the total cost. CDCs are licensed by the SBA. Required equity of the borrower is 10 percent. Terms of the first trust deed are typically similar to market rates for conventional real estate loans, while the CDC establishes rates and terms for the second trust deed loan.


• | SBA Express—These loans offer a 50 percent guaranty by the SBA and are made in amounts up to a maximum of $350,000. These loans are typically revolving lines and have maturities of up to 7 years.

SBA loans are subject to federal legislation that can affect the availability and funding of the program. This dependence on legislative funding might cause future limitations and uncertainties with regard to the continued funding of such programs, which could potentially have an adverse financial impact on our business. The Company’s portfolio of SBA loans is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to: (i) the effects of economic downturns on the economy; (ii) interest rate increases; (iii) deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral; and (iv) deterioration of a borrower's or guarantor's financial capabilities. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks through: (i) reviewing each loan request and renewal individually; (ii) adhering to written loan policies; (iii) adhering to SBA policies and regulations; (iv) obtaining independent third party appraisals; and (v) obtaining external independent credit reviews. SBA loans normally require monthly installment payments of principal and interest and therefore are continually monitored for past due conditions. In general, the Company receives and reviews financial statements and other documents of borrowers on an ongoing basis during the term of the relationship and responds to any deterioration identified.
Construction Loans
The Company provides short-term construction loans primarily relating to single family or multifamily residential properties. Construction loans are typically secured by first deeds of trust and guarantees of the borrower. The economic viability of the projects, borrower’s creditworthiness, and borrower’s and contractor’s experience are primary considerations in the loan underwriting decision. The Company utilizes independent state licensed appraisers approved by management and monitors projects during construction through inspections and a disbursement program tied to the percentage of completion of each project. The Company may, in the future, originate or purchase loans or participations in construction, renovation and rehabilitation loans on residential, multifamily and/or commercial real estate properties.
Lease Financing
On October 27, 2016, the Company sold its Commercial Equipment Finance business unit. For financial information, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Single Family Residential Mortgage Loans
The Company originates mortgage loans secured by a first deed of trust on single family residences mainly throughout California. The Company offers non-conforming SFR mortgage loans where the loan amount exceeds Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac limits, or the loans otherwise do not conform to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines.
The Company’s residential lending activities include both a direct-to-consumer retail residential lending business and a wholesale and correspondent mortgage business. In the retail business, the Company's loan officers are located either in the Company's call center in Santa Ana or full service branches in San Diego, Orange, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles Counties, and originate mortgage loans directly to consumers. The wholesale mortgage business originates SFR mortgage loans submitted to the Company by outside mortgage brokers for underwriting and funding. The correspondent mortgage business acquires residential mortgage loans originated by third parties. The Company does not originate loans defined as high cost by state or federal regulators.
The Company generally underwrites SFR mortgage loans based on the applicant’s income and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. Properties securing SFR mortgage loans are appraised by independent fee appraisers approved by management. The Company requires borrowers to obtain title insurance, hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if necessary. A majority of SFR mortgage loans originated by the Company are made to finance the purchase or the refinance of existing loans on owner occupied homes with a smaller percentage used to finance non-owner occupied homes.
The Company originates SFR mortgage loans on either a fixed or an adjustable rate basis, as consumer demand and the Bank’s risk management dictates. The Company’s pricing strategy for SFR mortgage loans includes setting interest rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions and mortgage originators.
Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) loans are offered with flexible initial repricing dates, ranging from 1 to 10 years, and periodic repricing dates through the life of the loan. The Company uses a variety of indices to reprice ARM loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company originated $1.01 billion of held-for-investment SFR ARM loans with terms up to 30 years. Of total SFR mortgage loans at December 31, 2018, $59.3 million, or 2.6 percent, were fixed rate, and $2.25 billion, or 97.4 percent, were adjustable rate. Of total SFR mortgage loans at December 31, 2017, $380 thousand, or 0.1 percent, were fixed rate, and $2.06 billion, or 99.9 percent, were adjustable rate.
The Company also offers interest only loans, which have payment features that allow interest only payments during the first five or seven years during which time the interest rate is fixed before converting to fully amortizing payments. Following the expiration of the fixed interest rate period, the interest rate and payment begins to adjust on an annual basis, with fully amortizing payments that include principal and interest calculated over the remaining term of the loan. The loan can be secured by owner or non-owner occupied properties that include single family units and second homes. For additional information, see “Non-Traditional Mortgage Portfolio” and “Non-Traditional Mortgage Loan Credit Risk Management” under “Loans and Leases Receivable, Net” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Consumer Loans
The Company offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including second deed of trust home equity loans and HELOCs and loans secured by deposits. The Company also offers a limited amount of unsecured loans. The Company originates consumer loans primarily in its market area. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity or variable interest rates, which reduce the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates, and carry higher rates of interest than do SFR mortgage loans. Management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to the Company’s existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
HELOCs have a seven or ten year draw period and require the payment of 1.0 percent or 1.5 percent of the outstanding loan balance per month (depending on the terms) or interest only payment during the draw period. Following receipt of payments, the available credit includes amounts repaid up to the credit limit. HELOCs with a ten-year draw period have a balloon payment due at the end of the draw period or then fully amortize for the remaining term. For loans with shorter-term draw periods, once the draw period has lapsed, generally, the payment is fixed based on the loan balance and prevailing market interest rates at that time.
The Company proactively monitors changes in the market value of all home loans contained in its portfolio. The most recent valuations were effective as of October 17, 2018. The Company has the right to adjust, and has adjusted, existing lines of credit to address current market conditions subject to the terms of the loan agreement and covenants. At December 31, 2018, unfunded commitments totaled $69.3 million on consumer lines of credit. Consumer loan terms vary according to the type of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower.
9

Investment Activities
The general objectives of the Company's investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan and lease demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan and lease demand is low and to provide a relatively stable source of interest income while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. For additional information, see Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Currently, the Company primarily invests in collateralized loan obligations. Historically, in addition to collateralized loan obligations, the Company has invested in SBA loan pool securities, U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securities, non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds. 
As an investor in CLOs, we purchase specific tranches, or slices, of debt instruments that are secured by professionally managed portfolios of senior secured loans to corporations. CLOs are not secured by residential or commercial mortgages. CLO managers are typically large non-bank financial institutions or banks. CLOs are typically $300 million to $1 billion in size, contain 100 or more loans, and have five to six credit tranches ranging from AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B and equity tranche. Interest and principal are paid out to the AAA tranche first then move down the capital stack. Losses are borne by the equity tranche first then move up the capital stack. CLOs typically have subordination levels that range from approximately 33 percent to 39 percent for AAA, 20 percent to 28 percent for AA, 15 percent to 18 percent for A and 10 percent to 14 percent for BBB.
The CLOs we currently hold may, from time to time, not be actively traded, and under certain market conditions may be relatively illiquid investments, and volatility in the CLO trading market may cause the value of these investments to decline. The market value of CLOs may be affected by, among other things, perceived changes in the economy, performance by the manager and performance of the underlying loans. 
Although we attempt to mitigate the credit and liquidity risks associated with CLOs by purchasing CLOs with credit ratings of A or higher and by maintaining a pre-purchase due diligence and ongoing review process by a dedicated credit administration team, no assurance can be given that these risk mitigation efforts will be successful.
Sources of Funds
General
The Company’s primary sources of funds are deposits, certificates of deposits, sales of loans and investment securities, payments on and maturities of outstanding loans and leases and investment securities, and other short-term investments and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from loans and leases and investment securities, and maturing investment securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan and lease prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. The Company also generates cash through borrowings. The Company mainly utilizes Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, as a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management.
Deposits
The Company offers a variety of deposit products to consumers, businesses, and institutional customers with a wide range of interest rates and terms. The Company's deposits consist of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit. The Company solicits deposits primarily in its market area, excluding brokered deposits. The Company primarily relies on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit products the Company offers has allowed the Company to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in demand from actual and prospective consumer, business and institutional customers. 
The Company tries to manage the pricing of deposits in keeping with the Company's asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to market competitive factors. Based on the Company's experience, the Company believes that the Company's deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. Despite this stability, the Company's ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them have been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.
Core deposits, which we define as interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit, excluding brokered and certain legacy high-rate, high-volatility deposits, increased $579.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and totaled $6.21 billion at December 31, 2018, representing 78.4 percent of total deposits on that date. The run-off of the legacy high-rate, high-volatility deposits was completed during the first quarter of 2018. The Company held brokered deposits of $1.71 billion, or 21.6 percent of total deposits, at December 31, 2018. 
10

Borrowings
Although deposits are the Company's primary source of funds, the Company may utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when the Company desires additional capacity to fund loan and lease demand or when they meet the Company's asset/liability management goals to diversify funding sources and enhance interest rate risk management.
The Company utilizes FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, to provide a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management. The Company also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Federal Reserve Bank), as well as through unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company may obtain advances from the FHLB by collateralizing the advances with certain of the Company’s loans and investment securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $1.52 billion in FHLB advances outstanding and the ability to borrow an additional $1.35 billion.
Availabilities and terms on securities sold under repurchase agreements are subject to the counterparties' discretion and pledging additional investment securities. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no securities sold under repurchase agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company voluntarily terminated a line of credit of $75.0 million that was maintained at Banc of California, Inc. with an unaffiliated financial institution. The Company also had the ability to borrow $60.6 million from the Federal Reserve Bank and $210.0 million from unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks as of December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, the Company has borrowed through the issuance of its senior notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes. The Company had $173.2 million in outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made the final installment payments on the junior subordinated amortizing notes. For additional information, see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition and Market Area
The Company faces strong competition in originating real estate and other loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and mortgage bankers. Other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer and commercial lending. The Company attracts deposits through its community banking branch network, its Treasury function and through the internet. Consequently, the Company has the ability to service client needs with a variety of deposit accounts and products at competitive rates. Competition for deposits is principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions, as well as mutual funds, broker dealers, registered investment advisors, investment banks financial institutions, financial service companies, and other alternative investments.
Based on the most recent branch deposit data as of June 30, 2018 provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Bank's share of deposits in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and Santa Barbara counties was as follows:
 | June 30, 2018
Los Angeles County | 0.63 | %
Orange County | 3.28 | %
San Diego County | 0.53 | %
Santa Barbara County | 0.52 | %

Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of 730 full-time employees and 11 part-time employees. The Company's employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.
Regulation and Supervision
General
The Company is extensively regulated under federal laws. As a financial holding company, Banc of California, Inc. is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA), and its primary regulator is the FRB. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation primarily by the OCC. In addition, the Bank is also subject to backup regulation from the FDIC.
Regulation and supervision by the federal banking agencies is intended primarily for the protection of customers and depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the FDIC and not for the benefit of stockholders. Set forth below is a brief 
11

description of material information regarding certain laws and regulations that are applicable to the Company and the Bank. This description, as well as other descriptions of laws and regulations in this Form 10-K, is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) enacted on July 1, 2010 is one of the most significant pieces of financial legislation since the 1930s. The Dodd-Frank Act and FRB policy require requires that bank holding companies, such as the Company, act as a source of financial and managerial strength for their insured depository institution subsidiaries, such as the Bank, particularly when such subsidiaries are in financial distress. The FRB has extensive enforcement authority over the Company and the OCC has extensive enforcement authority over the Bank under federal law. Enforcement authority generally includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. 
In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely filing of reports. Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of formal enforcement actions by the FRB and the OCC is required by law.
The Dodd-Frank Act made other significant changes to the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks, including the regulation of the Company and the Bank, and other significant changes will continue to occur as rules are promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulatory changes have had and will continue to have a material effect on the business and results of the Company and the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), with the authority to promulgate regulations intended to protect consumers with respect to financial products and services, including those provided by the Bank, and to restrict unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct by providers of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has issued rules under the Dodd-Frank Act affecting the Bank’s residential mortgage lending business, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The activities of the Bank are also subject to regulation under numerous federal laws and state consumer protection statutes.
In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting banks have been made both domestically and internationally. Among other things, these proposals include significant additional capital and liquidity requirements and limitations on size or types of activity in which banks may engage.
Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress that may affect our operations. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time. Any legislative or regulatory changes in the future, including those resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
2018 Regulatory Reform
In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, directs the federal banking regulators to simplify the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and includes regulatory relief regarding stress testing, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans, among other items. It is difficult at this time to predict when or how new standards under the Economic Growth Act will ultimately be applied, what specific impact this legislation and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have.
Banc of California, Inc.
As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the BHCA, Banc of California, Inc. may engage in activities permitted for bank holding companies and may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. “Financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking. See “Volcker Rule” below.
Banc of California, Inc. is required to register and file reports with, and is subject to regulation and examination by the FRB. The FRB’s approval is required for the acquisition of the Company, or the acquisition by the Company, of another financial institution or holding company thereof, and, under certain circumstances, the Company’s acquisition of other subsidiaries.
As a bank holding company, Banc of California, Inc. is subject to the regulations of the FRB imposing capital requirements for a bank holding company, which establish a capital framework as described in “Capital Requirements” below. As of 
12

December 31, 2018, Banc of California, Inc. was considered well-capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.
Under the FRB’s policy statement on the payment of cash dividends, a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. A bank holding company must give the FRB prior notice of any purchase or redemption of its equity securities if the consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the consideration for all such purchases or redemptions in the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 percent or more of its consolidated net worth. Notice to the FRB would include, but may not be limited to, background information on a redemption, pro-forma financial statements that reflect the planned transaction including impact to the Company and stress testing that incorporates the transaction. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would be an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, or condition imposed in writing by the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to a bank holding company that qualifies as well-capitalized, received a composite rating and a rating for management of “1” or “2” in its last examination and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issue. Regarding dividends, see "Capital Requirements" below.
The Bank
The Bank is subject to a variety of requirements under federal law. The Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. For additional information, see "Liquidity" included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan and lease underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure, and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution which fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.
The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.
FDIC Insurance
The deposits of the Bank are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. The basic deposit insurance limit is generally $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank’s deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $5.8 million. FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay an additional quarterly assessment called the FICO assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. This assessment will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid $279 thousand in FICO assessments.
The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums quarterly on each FDIC-insured institution based on annualized rates. Each institution with $10 billion or more in assets is assessed under a scorecard method using supervisory ratings, financial ratios and other factors. Such institutions are also subject to a temporary surcharge required by the Dodd-Frank Act which was discontinued for assessment periods commencing after September 30, 2018. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, deposit insurance premiums are assessed on the amount of an institution’s total assets minus its branch Tier 1 capital. Smaller institutions are assessed by a method using supervisory ratings and financial ratios.
Capital Requirements
The Company and the Bank are subject to capital regulations adopted by the FRB and the OCC. The current regulations, which became effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes being phased in over several years), establish required minimum ratios for common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital and a leverage ratio; set risk-weighting for assets and certain other items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; require an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum required capital ratios; and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. Under these capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent of total risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0 percent of total risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 4.0 percent. 
CET1 capital generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) except where an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, and certain minority interests, subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions, including deduction of certain amounts of mortgage servicing assets and certain deferred tax assets that exceed specified thresholds. The Company elected to permanently opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 capital plus noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and certain additional items less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of subordinated debt; 
13

certain other preferred stock, and allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.
Assets and certain off-balance sheet items are assigned risk-weights ranging from 0 percent to 1,250 percent, reflecting credit risk and other risk exposure, to determine total risk-weighted assets for the risk-based capital ratios. For some items, risk-weights have changed compared to their risk-weights under rules in effect before January 1, 2015. These include a 150 percent risk-weight (up from 100 percent ) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in non-accrual status, a 20 percent (up from 0 percent) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, and a 250 percent risk-weight (up from 100 percent) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, total capital and leverage ratios, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, when a buffer greater than 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets was required, which amount increased each year until the buffer requirement became fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
The OCC may establish an individual minimum capital requirement for a particular bank, based on its circumstances, which may vary from what would otherwise be required. The OCC has not imposed such a requirement on the Bank.
To be considered well-capitalized, the Company must maintain on a consolidated basis a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent or more and not be subject to any written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the FRB to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. For the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Bank, see “Prompt Corrective Action” below.
Although the Company continues to evaluate the impact that the capital rules will have on the Company and the Bank, management anticipates that the Company and the Bank will remain well-capitalized, and will meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.
Prompt Corrective Action
The Bank is required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under the capital and prompt corrective action regulations of the OCC. To be adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios discussed in “Capital Requirements” above. To be well-capitalized, an institution must have a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and not be subject to any written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary Federal banking regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Institutions that are not well-capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits.
The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against an institution that is less than adequately capitalized. Such an institution must submit a capital restoration plan, including a specified guarantee by its holding company, and until the plan is approved by the OCC, the institution may not increase its assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, and generally may not make capital distributions.
For institutions that are not at least adequately capitalized, progressively more severe restrictions generally apply as capital ratios decrease or if the OCC reclassifies an institution into a lower capital category due to unsafe or unsound practices or unsafe or unsound condition. Such restrictions may cover all aspects of operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition. An institution that becomes “critically undercapitalized” because it has a tangible equity ratio of 2.0 percent or less is generally subject to the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator for the institution within 90 days after it becomes critically undercapitalized. The imposition by the OCC of any of these measures on the Bank may have a substantial adverse effect on its operations and profitability.
Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Activity
Several federal laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act) require all financial institutions, including banks, to implement policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act also requires federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.
14

Community Reinvestment Act
The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the terms of the CRA, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its community, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, and does not limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community in a manner consistent with the CRA.
The OCC regularly assesses the Bank on its record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low-income and moderate-income neighborhoods. In the uniform four-tier- rating system used by federal banking agencies in assessing CRA performance, an "Outstanding" rating is the top tier rating. This CRA rating deals strictly with how well an institution is meeting its responsibilities under the CRA and the OCC takes into account performance under the CRA when considering a bank’s application to establish or relocate a branch or main office or to merge with, acquire assets, or assume liabilities of another insured depository institution. The bank’s record may be the basis for denying the application.
Performance under the CRA also is considered when the FRB reviews applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank, the FRB will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company, and that record may be the basis for denying the application.
Financial Privacy Under the Requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Company and its subsidiaries are required periodically to disclose to their retail customers the Company’s policies and practices with respect to the sharing of nonpublic customer information with its affiliates and others, and the confidentiality and security of that information. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLBA), retail customers also must be given the opportunity to “opt out” of information-sharing arrangements with non-affiliates, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the GLBA.
Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders
Transactions between the Bank and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is generally any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank but which is not a subsidiary of the bank. The Company and its subsidiaries are affiliates of the Bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the Bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0 percent of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0 percent of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes a loan by the Bank to an affiliate, the purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate by the Bank, the purchase of assets by the Bank from an affiliate, the acceptance by the Bank of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, or the issuance by the Bank of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Loans by the Bank to an affiliate must be collateralized.
In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders of the Bank and its affiliates. Under Section 22(h), aggregate loans to a director, executive officer or greater than 10.0 percent stockholder of the Bank or any of its affiliates, and certain related interests of such a person may generally not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests, 15.0 percent of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10.0 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral having a value at least equal to the amount of the loan. Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as those offered in comparable transactions to other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
There is an exception for loans that are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the Bank or its affiliate and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder or certain related interests over other employees of the Bank or its affiliate. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of all loans to all of the executive officers, directors and principal stockholders of the Bank or its affiliates and certain related interests may not exceed 100.0 percent of the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.
The Company and its affiliates, including the Bank, maintain programs to meet the limitations on transactions with affiliates and restrictions on loans to insiders and the Company believes it and the Bank are currently in compliance with these requirements.
15

Identity Theft
Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act), the Bank is required to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft “red flags” in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Under the FACT Act, the Bank is required to adopt reasonable policies and procedures to (i) identify relevant red flags for covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program: (ii) detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; (iii) respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and (iv) ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft.
The Bank maintains a program to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the Bank believes it is currently in compliance with these requirements.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations; Other Regulations
The Bank and its affiliates are subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers, including but not limited to the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement in Mortgage Licensing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws and various regulations that implement the foregoing. Among other things, these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. If the Bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties.
The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System that is responsible for regulating consumer financial products and services under federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority with respect to these laws. The Company and the Bank are subject to CFPB’s regulations regarding consumer financial services and products and to supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB has issued numerous regulations, and is expected to continue to do so in the next few years. The CFPB’s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has significantly affected, and is expected to continue to significantly affect, financial institutions involved in the provision of consumer financial products and services, including the Company and the Bank.
Restrictions on residential mortgages were also promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. The provisions include (i) a requirement that lenders make a determination that at the time a residential mortgage loan is consummated the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan and related costs; (ii) a ban on loan originator compensation based on the interest rate or other terms of the loan (other than the amount of the principal); (iii) a ban on prepayment penalties for certain types of loans; (iv) bans on arbitration provisions in mortgage loans; and (v) requirements for enhanced disclosures in connection with the making of a loan. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposes a variety of requirements on entities that service mortgage loans.
The OCC must approve an acquisition of the Bank and the Bank’s acquisition of other financial institutions and certain other acquisitions, and its establishment of branches. Generally, the Bank may branch de novo nationwide, but branching by acquisition may be restricted by applicable state law.
The Bank’s general limit on loans to one borrower is 15 percent of its capital and surplus, plus an additional 10 percent of its capital and surplus if the amount of loans greater than 15 percent of capital and surplus is fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Capital and surplus means Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital plus the amount of allowance for loan and lease losses not included in Tier 2 capital. The Bank has no loans in excess of its loans-to-one borrower limit.
OCC regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of a bank to make capital distributions, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, and certain other items. Generally, a bank may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100 percent of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years without prior OCC approval. However, the OCC may restrict dividends by an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision. Dividends can also be restricted if the capital conservation buffer requirement is not met.
The Bank is a member of the FHLB, which makes loans or advances to members. All advances are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. To be a FHLB member, financial institutions must demonstrate that they originate and/or purchase long-term home mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities. The Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $41.0 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.
16

Volcker Rule
The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker Rule. Under the regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, banking entities), are generally prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from proprietary trading of securities and other financial instruments and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a “covered fund.”
Trading in certain government obligations is not prohibited. These include, among others, obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or an agency or GSE of the United States, obligations of a State of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, and municipal securities. Proprietary trading generally does not include transactions under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and purchases and sales for the purpose of liquidity management if the liquidity management plan meets specified criteria; nor does it generally include transactions undertaken in a fiduciary capacity.
The term “covered fund” can include, in addition to many private equity and hedge funds and other entities, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations, and other items, but it does not include wholly owned subsidiaries, certain joint ventures, or loan securitizations generally, if the underlying assets are solely loans. The term “ownership interest” includes not only an equity interest or a partnership interest, but also an interest that has the right to participate in selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, director, trustee or investment manager or advisor; to receive a share of income, gains or profits of the fund; to receive underlying fund assets after all other interests have been redeemed; to receive all or a portion of excess spread; or to receive income on a pass-through basis or income determined by reference to the performance of fund assets. In addition, “ownership interest” includes an interest under which amounts payable can be reduced based on losses arising from underlying fund assets.
Activities eligible for exemptions include, among others, certain brokerage, underwriting and marketing activities, and risk-mitigating hedging activities with respect to specific risks and subject to specified conditions.
Future Legislation or Regulation
In light of recent conditions in the United States economy and the financial services industry, the Trump administration, Congress, the regulators and various states continue to focus attention on the financial services industry. Additional proposals that affect the industry have been, and will likely continue to be, introduced. The Company cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted or adopted or, if they are, the effect they would have on our business, the Company's operations or financial condition.

BANC OF CALIFORNIA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Operations: Banc of California, Inc. is a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, headquartered in Orange County, California and incorporated under the laws of Maryland. Banc of California, Inc.'s assets primarily consist of the outstanding stock of the Bank. Banc of California, Inc. is subject to regulation by the FRB and the Bank operates under a national bank charter issued by the OCC, its primary regulator. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system, and maintains insurance on deposit accounts with the FDIC.
The Bank offers a variety of financial services to meet the banking and financial needs of the communities it serves, with operations conducted through 32 banking offices, serving San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Orange counties in California as of December 31, 2018.
Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the Company include its wholly owned subsidiaries. The accounting and reporting polices of the Company are based upon U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which we may refer to as "GAAP" and conform to predominant practices within the financial services industry. Significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented below.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures provided, and actual results could differ. The allowance for loan and lease losses, reserve for loss on repurchased loans, reserve for unfunded loan commitments, servicing rights, realization of deferred tax assets, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, mortgage banking derivatives, purchased credit impaired loan discount accretion, HLBV of investments in alternative energy partnerships, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, and the fair value measurement of financial instruments are particularly subject to change and such change could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Change in Estimate: At December 31, 2016 the Company accrued a liability for estimated discretionary incentive compensation payments to certain employees. The amount paid was less than the accrued liability. Consequently, the Company reversed the excess accrual and recorded a pre-tax credit to salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of operations of $7.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The reversal, based on new information driven by changes to certain facts and circumstances subsequent to December 31, 2016, was determined to be a change in estimate.
Discontinued Operations: During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Banc Home Loans division, which largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment. In accordance with ASC 205-20, the Company determined that the sale of the Banc Home Loans division and certain other mortgage banking related assets and liabilities that will be sold or settled separately within one year met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and the related operating results and financial condition have been presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 for additional information. Unless otherwise indicated, information included in these notes to consolidated financial statements is presented on a consolidated operations basis, which includes results from both continuing and discontinued operations, for all periods presented.
Segment Reporting: In connection with the sale of its Banc Home Loans division, which largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment, the Company reassessed its reportable operating segments. Based on this internal evaluation, the Company determined that all three of its previously disclosed reportable segments, Commercial Banking, Mortgage Banking, and Corporate/Other, are no longer applicable. Accordingly, to better reflect how the Company is now managed and how information is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, the Company's chief executive officer, the Company determined that all services offered by the Company relate to Commercial Banking. As a result, the Company's only reportable segment is Commercial Banking.
105

Variable Interest Entities: The Company holds ownership interests in certain special purpose entities. The Company evaluates its interest in these entities to determine whether they meet the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE) and whether the Company is required to consolidate these entities. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a variable interest that could be significant to the VIE. A variable interest is a contractual, ownership or other interest that changes with changes in the fair value of the VIE’s net assets. To determine whether or not a variable interest the Company holds could be significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE. The Company analyzes whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of VIE on an ongoing basis. Changes in facts and circumstances occurring since the previous primary beneficiary determination are considered as part of this ongoing assessment. See Note 20 for additional information.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in transit, cash due from the Federal Reserve Bank and other financial institutions, and federal funds sold with original maturities less than 90 days.
Time Deposits in Financial Institutions: Time deposits in financial institutions have original maturities over 90 days and are carried at cost.
Investment Securities: Investment securities are classified at the time of purchase as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or held-for-trading. The Company had no investment securities classified as held-to-maturity or held-for-trading at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of taxes, and OTTI, net of taxes, reported in AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company evaluated its securities held-to-maturity and determined that certain securities no longer adhered to the Company’s strategic focus and could be sold or reinvested to potentially improve the Company’s liquidity position or duration profile. Accordingly, the Company was no longer able to assert that it had the intent to hold these securities until maturity. As a result, the Company transferred all $740.9 million of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale, which resulted in a pre-tax increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $22.0 million at the time of the transfer, June 30, 2017. Due to the transfer, the Company’s ability to assert that it has both the intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity will be limited for the foreseeable future.
Accreted discounts and amortized premiums are included in interest income using the level yield method, and realized gains or losses from sales of securities are calculated using the specific identification method.
Management evaluates securities for OTTI at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant such an evaluation. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are generally evaluated for OTTI under ASC 320, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. In determining OTTI under the ASC 320 model, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also considers whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and assesses whether the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The assessment of whether OTTI exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time. 
When OTTI occurs in either model, the amount of the impairment recognized in earnings depends on the Company’s intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (i) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and (ii) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings.
106

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Stock: The Bank is a member of the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank system. Members are required to own a certain amount of FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations under Interest and Dividend Income from Other Interest-Earning Assets.
Loans Held-For-Sale, Carried at Fair Value: Loans held for sale, carried at fair value, are conforming SFR mortgage loans that are originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, repurchased loans that were previously sold to Ginnie Mae and other GSEs, and loans sold to Ginnie Mae that are delinquent more than 90 days and subject to a unilateral purchase option by the Company. The fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on commitments outstanding from investors as well as what secondary market investors are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics, except for loans that are repurchased out of Ginnie Mae loan pools, and loans sold to Ginnie Mae that are delinquent more than 90 days and subject to a unilateral purchase option by the Company, which are valued based on an internal model.
Loans Held-for-Sale, Carried at Lower of Cost or Fair Value: The Company records non-conforming jumbo mortgage loans held-for-sale and certain commercial loans held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value, on an aggregate basis. Deferred loan origination fees and costs or purchase discounts or premiums included in the carrying value of the loans are not amortized and are included in the determination of gains or losses from the sale of the related loans. A valuation allowance is established if the fair value of such loans is lower than their cost, with a corresponding charge to noninterest income. When the Company changes its intent to hold loans for investment, the loans are transferred to held-for-sale at lower of cost or fair value on the transfer date and amortization of deferred fees and costs or purchase discounts or premiums is ceased. If a determination is made that a loan held-for-sale cannot be sold in the foreseeable future, it is held-for-investment at lower of cost or fair value on the transfer date.
Loans and Leases: When a determination is made at the time of commitment to originate or purchase loans as held-for-investment, it is the Company’s intent to hold these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to periodic review under the Company’s management evaluation processes, including asset/liability management. Loans and leases, other than PCI loans, that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff are recorded at the principal balance outstanding, net of charge-offs, unamortized purchase premiums and discounts, and deferred loan fees and costs. Amortization of deferred loan origination fees and costs or purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income as an adjustment to yield over the terms of loans and leases using the effective interest method. Deferred loan origination fees and costs on revolving lines of credit are amortized using the straight line method. Interest on loans and leases is credited to interest income as earned based on the interest rate applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance and is discontinued when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition is such that full collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, regardless of the length of past due status. Generally, loans and leases are placed on non-accrual status when scheduled payments become past due for 90 days or more. When accrual of interest is discontinued, any unpaid accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans and leases is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. A charge-off is generally recorded at 180 days past due for SFR mortgage loans if the unpaid principal balance exceeds the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans and lease financings are subject to a detailed review when 90 days past due to determine accrual status, or when payment is uncertain and a specific consideration is made to put a loan or lease on non-accrual status. A charge-off for commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, and lease financing is recorded when a loss is confirmed. Consumer loans, other than those secured by real estate, are typically charged off no later than 120 days past due. Loans and leases are returned to accrual status when the payment status becomes current or is restructured and the borrower has demonstrated a satisfactory payment trend subject to management’s assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan or lease.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: The ALLL is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses, and represents management’s best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing loan and lease portfolio as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition. Confirmed losses are charged against the ALLL. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ALLL. The Company performs an analysis of the adequacy of the ALLL at least quarterly. Management estimates the required ALLL balance using past loan and lease loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. The ALLL consists of three elements; (i) a specific allowance established for probable losses on individually identified impaired loans and leases, (ii) a quantitative allowance calculated using historical loss experience adjusted as necessary to reflect current conditions; and (iii) a qualitative allowance to capture economic, underwriting, process, credit, and other factors and trends that are not adequately reflected in the historical loss rates.
107

A loan or lease is deemed impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement. The Company measures expected credit losses on all impaired loans and leases individually under the guidance of ASC 310, Receivables, primarily through the evaluation of collateral values and estimated cash flows expected to be collected. Cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income. Loans for which the terms have been modified by granting a concession that normally would not be provided and where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties are considered TDRs and classified as impaired. 
Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. The impairment amount on a collateral dependent loan is generally charged-off to the ALLL, and the impairment amount on a loan that is not collateral dependent is set-up as a specific reserve. TDRs are also measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s effective rate at inception or at the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. For TDRs that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the ALLL.
At December 31, 2018, the following loan and lease portfolio segments have been identified:

• | Commercial and industrial (general commercial and industrial, warehouse lending, and direct leveraged lending)


• | Commercial real estate


• | Multifamily


• | SBA


• | Construction


• | SFR - 1st deeds of trust (general SFR mortgage and other)


• | Indirect Leverage Lending


• | Warehouse FixNFlip


• | Other consumer (HELOC and other)

The Company categorizes loans and leases into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers and lessees (also referred to as borrowers) to service their obligations such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans and leases individually by classifying the loans and leases as to credit risk.
Loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than SFR mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Commercial and industrial loans are also considered to have a greater degree of credit risk than SFR mortgage loans due to the fact commercial and industrial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions). SBA loans are similar to commercial and industrial loans, but have additional credit enhancement provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration, for up to 85 percent of the loan amount for loans up to $150 thousand and 75 percent of the loan amount for loans of more than $150 thousand. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of lease financing may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself (which, in turn, is often dependent in part upon general economic conditions). Consumer loans may entail greater risk than SFR mortgage loans given that collection of these loans is dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. 
Green Loans are also considered to carry a higher degree of credit risk due to their unique cash flows. Credit risk on this asset class is also managed through the completion of regular AVMs of the underlying collateral and monitoring of the borrower’s usage of this account to determine if the borrower is making monthly payments from external sources or “drawdowns” on their line. In cases where the property values have declined to levels less than the original LTV ratios, or other levels deemed prudent by the Company, the Company may curtail the line and/or require monthly payments or principal reductions to bring the loan in balance.
On the interest only loans, the Company projects future payment changes to determine if there will be a material increase in the required payment and then monitors the loans for possible delinquency. Individual loans are monitored for possible downgrading of risk rating.
108

Troubled Debt Restructurings: A loan is identified as a TDR when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and for economic or legal reasons related to these difficulties, the Company grants a concession to the borrower in the restructuring that it would not otherwise consider. The Company has granted a concession when, as a result of the restructuring to a troubled borrower, it does not expect to collect all amounts due, including principal and/or interest accrued at the original terms of the loan. The concessions may be granted in various forms, including a below-market change in the stated interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date, or a note split with principal forgiveness. Loans for which the borrower has been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent TDRs, impaired at the date of discharge, and charged down to the fair value of collateral less cost to sell. A restructuring executed at an interest rate that is at market interest rates based on the current credit characteristics of the borrower is not a TDR.
The Company’s policy is to place consumer loan TDRs, except those that were performing prior to TDR status, on non-accrual status for a minimum period of 6 months. Commercial TDRs are evaluated on a case-by-case basis for determination of whether or not to place them on non-accrual status. Loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance under the restructured terms of the loan for a minimum of 6 months. Initially, all TDRs are reported as impaired. Generally, TDRs are classified as impaired loans and reported as TDRs for the remaining life of the loan. Impaired and TDR classification may be removed if the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum of 6 months and through one fiscal year-end and the restructuring agreement specifies a market rate of interest equal to that which would be provided to a borrower with similar credit at the time of restructuring. In the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from TDR classification, it is the Company’s policy to continue to base its measure of loan impairment on the contractual terms specified by the loan agreement.
Other Real Estate Owned: OREO, which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans, is initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs of the real estate, based on current independent appraisals obtained at the time of acquisition, less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Loan balances in excess of fair value of the real estate acquired at the date of acquisition are charged off against the ALLL. A valuation allowance is established for any subsequent declines in fair value less estimated selling costs and adjusted as applicable. Gains and losses on the sale of OREO and reductions in fair value subsequent to foreclosure, and any subsequent operating expenses or income of such properties are included in All Other Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Bank Owned Life Insurance: The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key employees. BOLI is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract, which is the cash surrender value.
Premises, Equipment, and Capital Leases: Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The straight-line method is used for depreciation with the following estimated useful lives: building - 40 years and leasehold improvements - life of lease, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment - 3 to 7 years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. 
Servicing Rights - Mortgage (Carried at Fair Value): A servicing asset or liability is recognized when undertaking an obligation to service a financial asset under a mortgage servicing contract, as a result of the transfer of the Company's financial assets that meet the requirements for sale accounting. Such servicing asset or liability is initially measured at fair value based on either market prices for comparable servicing contracts or alternatively is based on a valuation model that is based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee, net of servicing costs, over the estimated life of the loan, using a discount rate based on the related loan rate and is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
The Company measures servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date and reports changes in fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur, and such changes are included within Net Revenue on Mortgage Banking Activities on the Statements of Operations of discontinued operations. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimates and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. Currently the Company does not hedge the effects of changes in fair value of its servicing assets. At December 31, 2018, MSRs of $66 thousand were classified as held-for-sale and valued based on a market bid adjusted for estimated early payoffs and paydowns. 
Servicing fee income, which is reported in Loan Servicing Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. 
109

Servicing Rights - SBA Loans (Carried at Lower of Cost or Fair Value): The Bank originates and sells the guaranteed portion of its SBA loans. To calculate the gain (loss) on sales of SBA loans, the Bank’s investment in the loan is allocated among the retained portion of the loan, the servicing retained, the interest-only strip and the sold portion of the loan, based on the relative fair market value of each portion. The gain (loss) on the sold portion of the loan is recognized at the time of sale based on the difference between sale proceeds and the amount of the allocated investment to the sold portion of the loan.
The portion of the servicing fees that represent contractually specified servicing fees (contractual servicing) is reflected as a servicing asset and is amortized over the estimated life of the servicing. In the event future prepayments exceed management’s estimates and future expected cash flows are inadequate to cover the servicing asset, impairment is recognized. The portion of servicing fees in excess of contractual servicing fees is reflected as interest-only strip receivables. Interest-only strip receivables are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had no interest-only strip receivables at December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and is assigned to specific reporting units. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is evaluated for impairment at least annually, normally during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently in the interim if events occur or circumstances change indicating it would more likely than not result in a reduction of the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. 
The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (Step 0). If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value based on the Step 0 analysis, the Company performs Step 1 of the two-step quantitative test. In Step 1, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. Discounted cash flow estimates include significant management assumptions relating to revenue growth rates, net interest margins, weighted-average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and it is not necessary to continue to Step 2 of the impairment process. Otherwise, Step 2 is performed where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit. If a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds fair value, the difference is charged to noninterest expense. 
Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights, or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either separately or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized to noninterest expense over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances change indicating the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Alternative Energy Partnerships: The Company invests in certain alternative energy partnerships (limited liability companies) formed to provide sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits (energy tax credits) and other tax credits. The Company is a limited partner in these partnerships, which were formed to invest in newly installed residential rooftop solar leases and power purchase agreements.
As the Company’s respective investments in these entities are more than minor, the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the investee’s activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. As a result, the Company is required to apply the equity method of accounting, which generally prescribes applying the percentage ownership interest to the investee’s GAAP net income in order to determine the investor’s earnings or losses in a given period. However, because the liquidation rights, tax credit allocations and other benefits to investors can change upon the occurrence of specified events, application of the equity method based on the underlying ownership percentages would not accurately represent the Company’s investment. As a result, the Company applies the HLBV method of the equity method of accounting. The HLBV method is a balance sheet approach where a calculation is prepared at each balance sheet date to estimate the amount that the Company would receive if the equity investment entity were to liquidate all of its assets (as valued in accordance with GAAP) and distribute that cash to the investors based on the contractually defined liquidation priorities. The difference between the calculated liquidation distribution amounts at the beginning and the end of the reporting period, after adjusting for capital contributions and distributions, is the Company’s share of the earnings or losses from the equity investment for the period.
To account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnerships, the Company uses the flow-through income statement method. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax differences in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned. The Company does not believe the investments in alternative energy partnerships are impaired by the lower corporate income tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 due to the protective provision built into the partnership agreements; however, the Company expects to take longer to utilize the investment tax credits generated from these investments.
110

Affordable Housing Fund Investment: The Company has invested in limited partnerships that were formed to develop and operate several apartment complexes designed as high-quality affordable housing for lower income tenants throughout the State of California and other states. The Company accounts for these investments under the proportional amortization method. The Company’s ownership in each limited partnership varies from 8 percent to 23 percent. Each of the partnerships must meet the regulatory minimum requirements for affordable housing for a minimum 15-year compliance period to fully utilize the tax credits. If the partnerships cease to qualify during the compliance period, the credit may be denied for any period in which the project is not in compliance and a portion of the credit previously taken is subject to recapture with interest.
As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, investments accounted for under the proportional amortization method are required to be tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying amount of the investment will not be realized. Impairment is measured as the difference between the investment’s carrying amount and its fair value. 
Long-Term Assets: Premises and equipment and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value, less selling costs. For impairment purposes, fair value is determined utilizing market values of similar assets or replacement cost as applicable.
Reserve for Loss on Repurchased Loans: In the ordinary course of business, as loans are sold, the Bank makes standard industry representations and warranties about the loans. The Bank may have to subsequently repurchase certain loans or reimburse certain investor losses that may have occurred due to defects in the origination of the loans. Such defects include documentation or underwriting errors. In addition, certain investor contracts require the Bank to repurchase loans from previous whole loan sales transactions that experience early payment defaults. If no losses are sustained due to such defects or early payment defaults, the Bank has no obligation to repurchase the loans. In addition, we have the option to buy out severely delinquent loans at par from Ginnie Mae pools for which we are the servicer and issuer of the pool. When such loans are repurchased, they are recorded initially at fair value at the time of repurchase. The resulting loss is charged against the repurchase reserve, typically the difference between unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest and the fair value at the time of repurchase. The reserve for loss on repurchased loans is an estimate that requires management judgment. The Bank’s reserve is based on expected future repurchase trends for loans already sold, and the expected loss recognized when such loans are repurchased, which include first and second trust deed loans. If loss reimbursements are made directly to the investor, the reserve for loss on repurchased loans is charged for the reimbursement losses incurred. 
Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments: The reserve for unfunded loan commitments provides for probable losses inherent with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments includes factors that are consistent with ALLL methodology using the expected loss factors and a draw down factor applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades. Changes in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments are reported as a component of All Other Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Deferred Financing Costs: Deferred financing costs associated with the Company’s senior notes and junior subordinated amortizing notes (Amortizing Notes) are included in Long-Term Debt, Net on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The deferred financing costs are being amortized on a basis that approximates a level yield method over the 8 year term of the senior notes. On May 15, 2017, the Company made the final installment payment on the Amortizing Notes and there were no outstanding Amortizing Notes at December 31, 2017. The deferred financing costs of Amortizing Notes were amortized on a basis that approximates a level yield method over the 5 year term. 
Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments: Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
Stock-Based Compensation: Compensation cost is recognized for stock options, restricted stock awards and units, and stock appreciation rights issued to employees and directors, based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights, while the market price of the Company’s voting common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards and units. Generally, compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, defined as meeting performance goals and the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation cost reflects estimated forfeitures, adjusted as necessary for actual forfeitures.
Income Taxes: Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Accounting guidance requires that companies assess whether a 
111

valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a “more likely than not” standard.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management evaluates both positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis, including the reversal of its taxable temporary differences, the existence of its historical earnings, the amounts of future projected earnings as well as the tax expiration periods of its income tax credits.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. Federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to examination by U.S. Federal taxing authorities for years before 2015. The statute of limitations for the assessment of California Franchise taxes has expired for tax years before 2014; other state income and franchise tax statutes of limitations vary by state.
Tax positions that are uncertain but meet a more-likely-than-not, recognition threshold are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to management's judgment. 
The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02 effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption, the Company reclassifies stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings in which the effect of changes in corporate income tax rates related to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was recorded.
Earnings Per Common Share: Earnings per common share is computed under the two-class method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding, including the minimum number of shares issuable under purchase contracts relating to the tangible equity units (see the discussion of the tangible equity units in Note 18). Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding, adjusted for the dilutive effect of the restricted stock units, the potentially issuable shares in excess of the minimum under purchase contracts relating to the tangible equity units, outstanding stock options, preferred stock redemption, and warrants to purchase common stock. Net income allocated to common stockholders is computed by subtracting income allocated to participating securities, participating securities dividends and preferred stock dividend from net income. Participating securities are instruments granted in stock-based payment transactions that contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, which includes the Stock Appreciation Rights to the extent they confer dividend equivalent rights.
Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Other comprehensive income or loss includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, which are recognized as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Derivative Instruments: The Company records its derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in Other Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, respectively, and has elected to present all derivatives with counterparties on a gross basis. For hedged derivatives, the Company records changes in fair value in AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and records any hedge ineffectiveness in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For non-hedged derivatives, the Company records changes in fair value in Net Revenue on Mortgage Banking Activities or Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Interest Rate Swaps and Caps. The Company offers interest rate swaps and caps products to certain loan customers to allow them to hedge the risk of rising interest rates on their variable rate loans. The Company originates a variable rate loan and enters into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap with the customer. The Company also enters into an offsetting swap with a correspondent bank. These back-to-back agreements are intended to offset each other and allow the Company to originate a variable rate loan, while providing a contract for fixed interest payments for the customer. The net cash flow for the Company is equal to the interest income received from a variable rate loan originated with the customer. The Company accounts for these derivative instruments as non-hedged derivatives with changes in fair value recorded to earnings each period. The changes in fair value on these instruments are recorded in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Foreign Exchange Contracts. The Company offers short-term foreign exchange contracts to its customers to purchase and/or sell foreign currencies at set rates in the future. These products allow customers to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk of their deposits and loans denominated in foreign currencies. In conjunction with these products the Company also enters into offsetting contracts with institutional counterparties to hedge the Company’s foreign exchange rate risk. These back-to-back contracts allow the Company to offer its customers foreign exchange products while minimizing its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The fair value of these instruments is determined at each reporting date based on the change in the foreign exchange rate. Given the short-term nature of the contracts, the counterparties’ credit risks are considered nominal and 
112

resulted in no adjustments to the valuation of the short-term foreign exchange contracts. The changes in fair value on these instruments are recorded in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments: The Company measures certain assets and liabilities on a fair value basis, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurement." Fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Examples of these include derivative instruments and available-for-sale securities. Additionally, fair value is used on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 825, "Financial Instruments." Examples of these include impaired loans, long-lived assets, OREO, goodwill, and core deposit intangible assets as well as loans held-for-sale accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. When observable market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis. These modeling techniques utilize assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, and the risk of nonperformance. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating the instrument’s fair value. Considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.
To increase consistency and comparability of fair value measures, ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurement" established a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques between observable inputs among (i) observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets, (ii) inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data, and (iii) unobservable data such as the Company’s own data or single dealer non-binding pricing quotes. The Company assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at the end of each quarter; as a result, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. 
Transfer of Financial Assets: Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is generally considered to have been surrendered when (i) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the Company or its consolidated affiliates, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets with no conditions that constrain the transferee or provide more than a trivial benefit to the Company, and (iii) the Company does not maintain an obligation or the unilateral ability to reclaim or repurchase the assets.
The Company has sold financial assets in the normal course of business, the majority of which are residential mortgage loan sales primarily to GSEs through the Company's mortgage banking activities and other individual or portfolio loans and securities sales. In accordance with accounting guidance for asset transfers, the Company considers any ongoing involvement with transferred assets in determining whether the assets can be derecognized from the balance sheet. With the exception of servicing and certain performance-based guarantees, the Company’s continuing involvement with financial assets sold is minimal and generally limited to market customary representation and warranty clauses.
When the Company sells financial assets, it may retain servicing rights and/or other interests in the financial assets. The gain or loss on sale depends on the previous carrying amount of the transferred financial assets and the fair value of the consideration received, including cash, originated mortgage servicing rights and other interests in the sold assets, and any liabilities incurred in exchange for the transferred assets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets and other interests retained by the Company are carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.
Loss Contingencies: Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements that are not currently accrued for. 
Dividend Restriction: Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the Company or by the Company to its stockholders.
113

Fee Revenue: Generally, fee revenue from deposit service charges and loans is recognized when earned, except where collection is uncertain, in which case revenue is recognized when received. As ASC 606 become effective in 2018, the Company has evaluated the accounting impact of adopting this guidance. The scope of this guidance explicitly excludes net interest income, as well as other revenues from transactions involving financial instruments such as loans, leases, and securities. Certain noninterest income items such as service charges on deposits accounts, gain and loss on other real estate owned sales, and other income items are within the scope of this guidance. The Company identified and reviewed revenue streams within the scope of this guidance, including escrow fees, trust and fiduciary fees, deposit service fees, debit card fees, investment commissions, and gains on sales of OREO, which represent a significant portion of the Company’s noninterest income that falls into the scope of this guidance. Based on its review, the Company determined that this guidance did not require significant changes to the manner in which income from those revenue streams within the scope of ASC 606 is currently recognized. 
Marketing Costs: Marketing costs are expensed as incurred.
Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: During the year ended December 31, 2018, the following pronouncements applicable to the Company were adopted:
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” This Update outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The model is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This Update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. The Update, as amended by ASU 2015-14, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2016-20, ASU 2017-13, and ASU 2017-14, is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company’s revenue streams primarily consist of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of this Update explicitly excludes net interest income, as well as other revenues from transactions involving financial instruments, such as loans, leases, and securities. Certain noninterest income items such as service charges on deposits accounts, gain and loss on other real estate owned sales, and other income items are within the scope of this Update. The Company evaluated the accounting impact of adopting this guidance based on the following “Five-step Model” prescribed in ASC 606: 

1. | identify the contract;


2. | identify the performance obligation in the contract;


3. | determine the transaction price;


4. | allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and


5. | recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

The Company identified and reviewed the revenue streams within the scope of the Update, including escrow fees, trust and fiduciary fees, deposit service fees, debit card fees, investment commissions, gains on sales of OREO, referral fees, and income from joint marketing with a certain credit card company. The Company determined that the new guidance will not require significant changes to the manner in which income from those revenue streams is currently recognized. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, the Company has enhanced its processes to identify contracts within the scope of Topic 606 and apply the Five-step Model to determine how revenue should be recognized. The Company adopted this Update and its related amendments effective January 1, 2018 utilizing the modified retrospective approach. Since there was no net income impact upon adoption of the new guidance, a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings was not deemed necessary. See Note 24 for additional information. 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This Update amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments by requiring a qualitative assessment; eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose methods and assumptions for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the statement of financial position; requires the exit price notion to be used when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability; requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category; and certain other requirements. This ASU and ASU 2018-04 became effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. With regard to the aforementioned exit price notion, the Company measured the fair value of its loans and leases portfolio for disclosure purposes starting March 31, 2018 using an exit price notion. See Note 3 for additional information. 
114

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)." The amendments in this Update provide guidance on classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments. For public business entities that are SEC filers, this Update was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).” The amendments in this Update are intended to reduce diversity in practice regarding classification of changes in restricted cash, requiring an entity to provide changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents during the period in a statement of cash flows. This Update is effective for public business entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805).” This Update provides guidance on evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition (or disposal) of assets or a businesses. This Update provides a more robust framework to use when determining whether a set of assets and activities represents a business. Public business entities must prospectively apply the amendment in this Update to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods. Adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05, “Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets.” This Update clarifies the scope and application of ASC 610-20 on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets, including real estate, and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales. An entity should identify each distinct nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset promised to a counterparty and derecognize each asset when the counterparty obtains control of it. In addition, the amendment requires an entity to derecognize a distinct nonfinancial asset, or an in-substance nonfinancial asset, in a partial sale transaction when the entity does not retain a controlling financial interest in the legal entity that holds the asset and transfers control of the asset. Once control is transferred, any non-controlling interest received is required to be measured at fair value. The new guidance was effective for public business entities in annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.” This Update provides guidance on when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award are to be accounted for as modifications. Under the new guidance, entities are not required to apply modification accounting to a share-based payment award when the award’s fair value, vesting conditions, and classification as an entity or a liability instrument remain the same after the change. The new guidance was effective for all entities beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within the fiscal year. Upon adoption, the guidance was applied prospectively to awards modified on or after the adoption date. Adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02. "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." This Update allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amendments in this Update also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company early adopted this Update during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and reclassified its stranded tax effect in accumulated other comprehensive income that resulted from the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate to retained earnings. 
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15. “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” The ASU reduces complexity for the accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service arrangement and was issued in response to a consensus reached by the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. The amendments in this Update align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for those incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract is required to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract. For public business entities, this guidance should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this guidance during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 to allow for the capitalization of implementation costs associated with cloud computing solutions. Adoption of the new guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
115

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective
In February 2016, the FASB established Topic 842, "Leases", by issuing Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, which impacts our accounting for leases as a lessee. Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; and ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements. 
For lessees, the new standard establishes a right-of-use model (ROU) that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the income statement.
For lessors, a lease is a sales-type lease if any one of five criteria are met, each of which indicates that the lease, in effect, transfers control of the underlying asset to the lessee. If none of those five criteria are met, but two additional criteria are both met, indicating that the lessor has transferred substantially all the risks and benefits of the underlying asset to the lessee and a third party, the lease is a direct financing lease. All leases that are not sales-type or direct financing leases are operating leases.
The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transition requirements for existing leases also apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date. The entity must also recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods. We will adopt the new standard on January 1, 2019 and use the effective date as our date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. We will elect the ‘package of practical expedients’, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We will not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight or the practical expedient pertaining to land easements; the latter not being applicable to us. 
As a lessee, we expect that this standard will have a material effect on our financial statements. We believe the most significant effects to the adoption of the new standard relate to the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases and providing significant new disclosures regarding our leasing activities. We do not expect significant changes in our leasing activities between now and adoption. On adoption, we currently expect to recognize additional operating liabilities ranging from $23.0 million to $25.0 million, with corresponding ROU assets of the same or less amount based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments under current leasing standards for existing operating leases. As a result, our capital ratios will be negatively impacted ranging from 2 to 5 basis points.
For lessees, the new standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. Accordingly, as a lessee, we will elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. This means, for those leases that qualify, we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. We also will elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.
As a lessor, the new standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements and do not expect significant changes in our leasing activities between now and adoption. We believe all of our leases will continue to be classified as operating leases under the new standard.
For lessors, while the new standard identifies common area building maintenance as a non-lease component of our real estate lease contracts, we will apply the practical expedient to account for our real estate leases and associated common area maintenance service components as a single, combined operating lease component. Consequently, the new standard’s changed guidance on contract components will not affect our financial reporting. 
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”). This guidance is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this guidance replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is available as of the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018. Currently, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the impact may be significant. That assessment is based upon the fact that, unlike the incurred loss models in existing GAAP, the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model in ASU 2016-13 does not specify a threshold for the recognition of an impairment allowance. Rather, the Company will recognize an impairment allowance equal to its estimate of lifetime expected credit losses, 
116

adjusted for prepayments, for in-scope financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, the impairment allowance measured under the CECL model could increase significantly from the impairment allowance measured under the Company’s existing incurred loss model. We have established a working group under the direction of the CECL Committee composed of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Accounting Officer. The Company has engaged a third-party vendor to assist in the CECL calculation and has developed an internal governance framework to oversee the CECL implementation. Other significant CECL implementation matters in process and being addressed by the Company include selecting loss estimation methodologies, identifying, sourcing and storing data, addressing data gaps, defining a reasonable and supportable forecast period, selecting historical loss information which will be reverted to, documenting the CECL estimation process, assessing the impact to internal controls over financial reporting, capital planning and seeking process approval from audit and regulatory stakeholders.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ("ASU 2017-04"). The amendments in this ASU simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ("ASU 2018-13"). The primary objective of ASU 2018-13 is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, although early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 is not expected to significantly impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2 – SALES OF BRANCH, SUBSIDIARY AND BUSINESS UNITS
The Palisades Group Sale
On May 5, 2016, the Company completed the sale of all of its membership interests in The Palisades Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to an entity wholly owned by Stephen Kirch and Jack Macdowell who serve as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of The Palisades Group, respectively. As part of the sale, The Palisades Group issued to the Company a 10 percent, $5.0 million note due May 5, 2018. The Company recognized a gain on sale of subsidiary of $3.7 million on its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The following table summarizes the calculation of the gain on sale of The Palisades Group recognized:
($ in thousands) | Year Ended December 31, 2016
Consideration received (paid) | 
Liabilities forgiven by The Palisades Group | $ | 1,862
Liabilities assumed by the Company | (1,078 | ) 
The Note | 2,370 | 
Aggregate fair value of consideration received | 3,154 | 
Less: net assets sold (carrying amount of The Palisades Group) | (540 | ) 
Gain on sale of The Palisades Group | $ | 3,694

The Company estimated various potential future cash flow projection scenarios for The Palisades Group and established probability thresholds for each scenario to arrive at a probability weighted cash flow expectation, which was then discounted to yield a fair value of the Note at sale date of $2.4 million.
On September 28, 2016, the Note was paid in full in cash prior to maturity and the Company recognized an additional gain of $2.8 million, which is included in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Commercial Equipment Finance Business Sale
On October 27, 2016, the Company sold its Commercial Equipment Finance business unit from its Commercial Banking segment to Hanmi. As part of the transaction, Hanmi acquired $217.2 million of equipment leases diversified across the U.S. with concentrations in California, Georgia and Texas. An additional $25.4 million of equipment leases were transferred during December 2016. Hanmi retained most of the Company’s former Commercial Equipment Finance employees. The Company recorded a gain on sale of business unit of $2.6 million in its Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Banc Home Loans Sale
On March 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of specific assets and activities related to its Banc Home Loans division to Caliber Home Loans, Inc. (Caliber). The Banc Home Loans division largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment, the activities of which related to originating, servicing, underwriting, funding and selling single family residential (SFR) mortgage loans. Assets sold to Caliber included mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) on certain conventional agency SFR mortgage loans. The Banc Home Loans division, along with certain other mortgage banking related assets and liabilities that were sold or settled separately within one year, is classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain components of the Company’s Mortgage Banking segment, including MSRs on certain conventional agency SFR mortgage loans that were not sold as part of the Banc Home Loans sale and repurchase reserves related to previously sold loans, have been classified as continuing operations in the consolidated financial statements as they remain part of the Company’s ongoing operations.
The specific assets acquired by Caliber include, among other things, the leases relating to the Company’s dedicated mortgage loan origination offices and rights to certain portions of the Company’s unlocked pipeline of residential mortgage loan applications. Caliber has assumed certain obligations and liabilities of the Company under the acquired leases, and with respect to the employment of transferred employees. The Company received a $25.0 million cash premium payment, in addition to the net book value of certain assets acquired by Caliber, totaling $2.5 million, upon the closing of the transaction. Additionally, the Company could receive an earn-out, payable quarterly, based on future performance over the 38 months following completion of the transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized an earn-out of $2.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Since the completion of the transaction, the Company has recognized a total earn-out of $4.0 million in Income from Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Caliber retains an option to buy out the future earn-out payable to the Company for cash consideration of $35.0 million, less the aggregate amount of all earn-out payments made prior to the date on which Caliber pays the buyout amount.

Caliber also purchased the MSRs of $37.8 million on approximately $3.86 billion in unpaid balances of conventional agency mortgage loans, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $1.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively, to net gain on disposal of discontinued operations. Net gain on
disposal of discontinued operations recognized in the first half of 2018 was primarily the result of the release of $1.0 million in
liability for estimated discretionary incentive compensation payments to certain employees transferred to Caliber as the amount
paid was less than the accrued liability. During the two years ended December 31, 2018, the entire transaction has resulted in a net gain on disposal of $15.2 million.
The Banc Home Loans division originated conforming SFR mortgage loans and sold these loans in the secondary market. The amount of net revenue on mortgage banking activities was a function of mortgage loans originated for sale and the fair values of these loans and related derivatives. Net revenue on mortgage banking activities included mark to market pricing adjustments on loan commitments and forward sales contracts, and initial capitalized value of MSRs.
The following table summarizes the calculation of the net gain on disposal of discontinued operations:

NOTE 3 – FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value Hierarchy
ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The topic describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

• | Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.


• | Level 2: Significant observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.


• | Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis
Securities Available-for-Sale: The fair values of securities available-for-sale are generally determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, the Company primarily employs independent pricing services that utilize pricing models to calculate fair value. Such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments. The Company employs procedures to monitor the pricing service's assumptions and establishes processes to challenge the pricing service's valuations that appear unusual or unexpected. Multiple quotes or prices may be obtained in this process and the Company determines which fair value is most appropriate based on market information and analysis. Quotes obtained through this process are generally non-binding. The Company follows established procedures to ensure that assets and liabilities are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 securities include SBA loan pool securities, U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise residential mortgage-backed securities, non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and corporate debt securities. When a market is illiquid or there is a lack of transparency around the inputs to valuation, including at least one unobservable input, the securities are classified as Level 3 and reliance is placed upon internally developed models, and management judgment and evaluation for valuation. The Company had no securities available-for-sale classified as Level 3 at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Loans Held-for-Sale, Carried at Fair Value: The fair value of loans held-for-sale is based on commitments outstanding from investors as well as what secondary market investors are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics, except for loans that are repurchased out of Ginnie Mae loan pools that become severely delinquent which are valued based on an internal model. Loans previously sold to GNMA that are delinquent more than 90 days are subject to a repurchase option when that condition exists. These loans were re-recognized at fair value and offset by a secured borrowing, as the loans were still legally owned by GNMA but failed sale accounting treatment under GAAP due to the repurchase option. Loans held-for-sale subject to recurring fair value adjustments are classified as Level 2 or, in the case of loans repurchased, Level 3. The fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest. As of December 31, 2018, there were no loans delinquent more than 90 days and eligible to be repurchased out of GNMA loan pools. GNMA loans delinquent more than 90 days were subject to a repurchase option that was eliminated as a result of the sale of the related MSRs to third parties during 2018. As of December 31, 2017, loans eligible to be repurchased out of GNMA loan pools of $66.0 million were classified as Level 3.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities:
Interest Rate Swaps and Caps. The Company offers interest rate swaps and caps products to certain loan customers to allow them to hedge the risk of rising interest rates on their variable rate loans. The Company originates a variable rate loan and enters into a variable-to-fixed interest rate swap with the customer. The Company also enters into an offsetting swap with a correspondent bank. These back-to-back agreements are intended to offset each other and allow the Company to originate a variable rate loan, while providing a contract for fixed interest payments for the customer. The net cash flow for the Company is equal to the interest income received from a variable rate loan originated with the customer. The fair value of these derivatives is based on a discounted cash flow approach. Due to the observable nature of the inputs used in deriving the fair value of these derivative contracts, the valuation of interest rate swaps is classified as Level 2.
Mortgage Servicing Rights: The Company retains servicing on some of its mortgage loans sold and elected the fair value option for these MSRs. Generally, the value is estimated based on a valuation from a third party provider that calculates the present value of the expected net servicing income from the portfolio based on key factors that include interest rates, prepayment assumptions, discount rate and estimated cash flows. Because of the significance of unobservable inputs, these servicing rights 
121

are classified as Level 3. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, MSRs valued based on a third party provider's valuation were $1.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, MSRs held-for-sale of $66 thousand and $29.8 million, respectively, were valued based on a market bid adjusted for early payoffs and paydowns and included as Level 3.

Loans repurchased or eligible to be repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools had aggregate unpaid principal balances of $25.5 million and $99.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The following table presents, as of the dates indicated, quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements on a recurring basis, other than loans that become severely delinquent and are repurchased out of Ginnie Mae loan pools that were valued based on an estimate of the expected loss the Company will incur on these loans, which was included as Level 3 at December 31, 2018 and 2017:
($ in thousands) | Fair Value | | Valuation Technique(s) | Unobservable Input(s) | Range (Weighted-Average)

(1) | Excludes MSRs held-for-sale of $66 thousand and $29.8 million, respectively, which were valued based on a market bid adjusted for expected obligations arising from standard representations and warranties at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

124

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s servicing rights include the discount rate and prepayment rate. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's loans repurchased from Ginnie Mae pools at December 31, 2018 and 2017 included an expected loss rate of 1.55 percent for insured loans and 20.00 percent for uninsured loans. There may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results.
Fair Value Option
Loans Held-for-Sale, Carried at Fair Value: The Company elected the fair value option for certain SFR mortgage loans held-for-sale. Electing to measure SFR mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. The Company also elected to record loans repurchased from GNMA at fair value, as the Company intends to sell them after curing any defects and, accordingly, they are classified as held-for-sale. Loans previously sold to GNMA that are delinquent more than 90 days are subject to a repurchase option when that condition exists. These loans were re-recognized at fair value and offset by a secured borrowing, as the loans were still legally owned by GNMA.
The following table presents the fair value and aggregate principal balance of certain assets, on a consolidated operations basis, under the fair value option:

The assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses from initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. The following table presents changes in fair value related to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value included in earnings for these assets and liabilities measured at fair value for the periods indicated:
 | Year Ended December 31,

Net gains (losses) from fair value changes | | | | | 
Net gain (loss) on sale of loans (continuing operations) | $ | 204 | | | $ | (170 | ) | $ | 29
Net revenue on mortgage banking activities (discontinued operations) | 159 | | | (288 | ) | | 7,365

Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Interest income on loans held-for-sale under the fair value option is measured based on the contractual interest rate and reported in Loans and Leases, including Fees under Interest and Dividend Income and Income from Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
125

Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis
Impaired Loans and Leases: The fair value of impaired loans and leases with specific allocations of the ALLL based on collateral values is generally based on recent real estate appraisals and AVMs. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically deemed significant unobservable inputs used for determining fair value and result in a Level 3 classification.
Other Real Estate Owned Assets: OREO assets initially are recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure. Thereafter, they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of other real estate owned assets is generally based on recent real estate appraisals adjusted for estimated selling costs. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments may be significant and result in a Level 3 classification due to the unobservable inputs used for determining fair value. Only OREO assets with a valuation allowance are considered to be carried at fair value. The Company recorded valuation allowance expense for OREO assets of $53 thousand, $236 thousand and $31 thousand, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 in All Other Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-03, which require the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair values of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. Starting in the first quarter of 2018, the Company updated our methodology used to estimate fair values for our loan portfolio to conform to the new requirements. The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value for the Company's financial instruments note recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are described as follows:
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Time Deposits in Financial Institutions: The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and time deposits in financial institutions approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments (Level 1).
Federal Home Loan Bank and Other Bank Stock: Federal Home Loan Bank and other bank stock are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Ownership of FHLB stock is restricted to member banks, and purchases and sales of these securities are at par value with the issuer (Level 2).
Loans and Leases Receivable, Net of ALLL: For the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value of loans and leases receivable is estimated based on the discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate was derived from the associated yield curve plus spreads and reflects the rates offered by the Bank for loans with similar financial characteristics. Yield curves are constructed by product and payment types. These rates could be different from what other financial institutions could offer for these loans. Additionally, the fair value of our loans may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such loans and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize (Level 3). This method of estimating fair value does not incorporate the exit-price concept of fair value prescribed by ASC Topic 820. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we utilized the exit price notion to determine the fair value of loans and leases receivable. 
Accrued Interest Receivable: The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value (Level 1).
Deposits: The fair value of deposits is estimated based on discounted cash flows. The cash flows for non-maturity deposits, including savings accounts and money market checking, are estimated based on their historical decaying experiences. The discount rate used for fair valuation is based on interest rates currently being offered by the Bank on comparable deposits as to amount and term (Level 3).
Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank and Other Borrowings: The fair values of advances from FHLB and other borrowings are estimated based on a discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate was derived from the current market rates for borrowings with similar remaining maturities (Level 2).
Long-Term Debt: Fair value of long-term debt is determined by observable data such as market spreads, cash flows, yield curves, credit information, and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments (Level 2).
Accrued Interest Payable: The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value (Level 1).

During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company evaluated its securities held-to-maturity and determined that certain securities no longer adhered to the Company’s strategic focus and could be sold or reinvested to potentially improve the Company’s liquidity position or duration profile. Accordingly, the Company was no longer able to assert that it had the intent to hold these securities until maturity. As a result, the Company transferred all $740.9 million of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale, which resulted in a pre-tax increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $22.0 million at the time of the transfer, June 30, 2017. Due to the transfer, the Company’s ability to assert that it has both the intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity will be limited for the foreseeable future.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of all remaining corporate debt securities,
totaling $76.8 million, to reposition its securities available-for-sale portfolio. At December 31, 2018, the Company's
investment securities portfolio consisted of SBA loan pool securities, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized loan
obligations. The expected maturities of these types of securities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may
have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company changed its intent to sell its non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position due to its strategy to remix its securities profile and recognized $3.3 million of OTTI loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company did not record OTTI losses for investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no holdings of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10 percent of stockholders’ equity.

At December 31, 2018, the Company’s securities available-for-sale portfolio consisted of 145 securities, 118 of which were in an unrealized loss position. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s securities available-for-sale portfolio consisted of 191 securities, 33 of which were in an unrealized loss position. 
The Company monitors its securities portfolio to ensure it has adequate credit support. The majority of unrealized losses are
related to the Company's mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S government sponsored entities and agencies. The Company
also considers the lowest credit rating for identification of potential OTTI for other securities. As of December 31, 2018, nearly
all of the Company's non-agency mortgage-backed securities or collateralized loan obligations investment securities in an
unrealized loss position received an investment grade credit rating. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest
rates and not credit quality. Other than the OTTI recognized related to the non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, as of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have the intent to sell its securities in an unrealized loss position and further believes it is not likely that it will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Loans
The Company’s NTM portfolio is comprised of three interest only products: Green Loans, Interest Only loans and a small number of additional loans with the potential for negative amortization. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the NTM loans totaled $826.7 million, or 10.7 percent of total loans and leases, and $806.9 million, or 12.1 percent of total loans and leases, respectively. The total NTM portfolio increased by $19.8 million, or 2.5 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The following table presents the composition of the NTM portfolio as of the dates indicated:

Green Loans
Green Loans are single family residential first and second mortgage lines of credit with a linked checking account that allows all types of deposits and withdrawals to be performed. The loans are generally interest only for a 15-year term with a balloon payment due at maturity. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Green Loans totaled $70.1 million and $85.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, none of the Company’s Green Loans were non-performing. As a result of their unique payment feature, Green Loans possess higher credit risk due to the potential for negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through the Company’s loan terms and underwriting standards, including its policies on LTV ratios and the Company’s contractual ability to curtail loans when the value of the underlying collateral declines. The Company discontinued origination of the Green Loan products in 2011.
Interest Only Loans
Interest Only loans are primarily single family residential first mortgage loans with payment features that allow interest only payments in initial periods before converting to a fully amortizing loan. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Interest Only loans totaled $753.1 million and $717.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $0 and $1.2 million of the Interest Only loans were non-performing, respectively.
Loans with the Potential for Negative Amortization
Negative amortization loans totaled $3.5 million and $3.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company discontinued origination of negative amortization loans in 2007. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, none of the loans with the potential for negative amortization were non-performing. These loans pose a potentially higher credit risk because of the lack of principal amortization and potential for negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through the loan terms and underwriting standards, including the Company’s policies on LTV ratios.
134

Risk Management of Non-Traditional Mortgages
The Company has determined that significant performance indicators for NTMs are LTV ratios and FICO scores. Accordingly, the Company manages credit risk in the NTM portfolio through periodic review of the loan portfolio that includes refreshing FICO scores on the Green Loans and HELOCs, as needed in conjunction with portfolio management, and ordering third party AVMs. The loan review is designed to provide a method of identifying borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulty before they actually fail to make a loan payment. Upon receipt of the updated FICO scores, an exception report is run to identify loans with a decrease in FICO score of 10 percent or more and/or a resulting FICO score of 620 or less. The loans are then further analyzed to determine if the risk rating should be downgraded, which will increase the reserves the Company will establish for potential losses. A report of the periodic loan review is published and regularly monitored.
As these loans are revolving lines of credit, the Company, based on the loan agreement and loan covenants of the particular loan, as well as applicable rules and regulations, could suspend the borrowing privileges or reduce the credit limit at any time the Company reasonably believes that the borrower will be unable to fulfill their repayment obligations under the agreement or certain other conditions are met. In many cases, the decrease in FICO score is the first indication that the borrower may have difficulty in making their future payment obligations.
The Company proactively manages the NTM portfolio by performing detailed analyses on the portfolio. The Company’s IARC meets at least quarterly to review the loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful and determines whether a suspension or reduction in credit limit is warranted. If a line has been suspended and the borrower would like to have their credit privileges reinstated, they would need to provide updated financials showing their ability to meet their payment obligations.
On the interest only loans, the Company projects future payment changes to determine if there will be a material increase in the required payment and then monitors the loans for possible delinquency. Individual loans are monitored for possible downgrading of risk rating.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The Company has established credit risk management processes that include regular management review of the loan and lease portfolio to identify problem loans and leases. During the ordinary course of business, management becomes aware of borrowers and lessees who may not be able to fulfill the contractual payment requirements of the loan and lease agreements. Such loans and leases are subject to increased monitoring. Consideration is given to placing the loan or lease on non-accrual status, assessing the need for additional ALLL, and partial or full charge-off of the principal balance. The Company maintains the ALLL at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated incurred loss in the loan and lease portfolio.
The Company also maintains a separate reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated incurred loss. The estimated funding of the loan commitments and credit risk factors determined based on outstanding loans that share similar credit risk exposure are used to determine the adequacy of the reserve. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $4.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively, which are recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
The credit risk monitoring system is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans, and to perform periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in a timely manner. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Bank has adopted a credit policy that includes a credit review and control system that it believes should be effective in ensuring that the Company maintains an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses. The Board of Directors also provides oversight and guidance for management’s allowance evaluation process. The Company’s loan segmentation increased from 11 to 13 segments, with the addition of an Indirect Leverage Lending segment and a Warehouse FixNFlip segment.  Management concluded these products represented unique credit and risk characteristics to warrant separate segmentation. Additionally, management enhanced the methodology in the areas of qualitative adjustments, and performed an annual update of the loss emergence period. These updates were designed to be systematic, transparent, and repeatable. None of the updates and enhancements made to the ALLL methodology had a material impact on the reserve at December 31, 2018.
The following table presents a summary of activity in the ALLL for the periods indicated:
 | Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Balance at beginning of year | $ | 49,333 | | | $ | 40,444 | | | $ | 35,533
Loans and leases charged-off | (18,499 | ) | | (5,581 | ) | | (2,618 | )
Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off | 1,143 | | | 771 | | | 2,258 | 
Provision for loan and lease losses | 30,215 | | | 13,699 | | | 5,271 | 
Balance at end of year | $ | 62,192 | | | $ | 49,333 | | | $ | 40,444

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a charge-off of $13.9 million, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15.0 million line of credit that was originated during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Subsequent to the granting of the line of credit, representations from the borrower in applying for the line of credit were determined by the Bank to be false, and third party bank account statements provided by the borrower to secure the line of credit were found to be fraudulent. The line of credit was granted after the borrower appeared to have satisfied a pre-condition that the line of credit be fully cash collateralized and secured by a bank account at a third party financial institution pledged to the Bank. As part of the Bank’s credit review and portfolio management process, the line of credit and disbursements were reviewed subsequent to closing and compliance with the borrower’s covenants was monitored. As part of this process, on March 9, 2018, the Bank received information that caused it to believe the existence of the pledged bank account had been misrepresented by the borrower and that the account had previously been closed. The Bank filed an action in federal court pursuing the borrower and other parties and is also considering other available sources of collection and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in this regard. Upon extensive review of the underwriting process for this loan, the Bank determined that this loan was the result of an isolated event of external fraud.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A modification of a loan constitutes a TDR when the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The concessions may be granted in various forms, including reduction in the stated interest rate, reduction in the amount of principal amortization, forgiveness of a portion of the loan balance or accrued interest, or extension of the maturity date. In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company’s internal underwriting policy.

Credit Quality Indicators
The Company categorizes loans and leases into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company performs historical loss analysis that is combined with a comprehensive loan or lease to value analysis to analyze the associated risks in the current loan and lease portfolio. The Company analyzes loans and leases individually by classifying the loans and leases as to credit risk. This analysis includes all loans and leases delinquent over 60 days and non-homogeneous loans and leases such as commercial and commercial real estate loans and leases. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
Pass: Loans and leases classified as pass are in compliance in all respects with the Bank’s credit policy and regulatory requirements, and do not exhibit any potential or defined weakness as defined under “Special Mention”, “Substandard” or “Doubtful”.
Special Mention: Loans and leases classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease or of the Company’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard: Loans and leases classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans and leases so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful: Loans and leases classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loans and leases not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans and leases.

NOTE 7 – SERVICING RIGHTS
The Company retains MSRs from certain of its sales of residential mortgage loans. MSRs on residential mortgage loans are reported at fair value. Income earned by the Company on its MSRs is derived primarily from contractually specified mortgage servicing fees and late fees, net of curtailment costs and third party subservicing costs. The Company retains servicing rights in connection with its SBA loan operations, which are measured using the amortization method.
The following table presents a composition of total income from servicing rights, which is reported in Loan Servicing Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, on a consolidated operations basis, for the periods indicated:

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company suspended sales of MSRs under a flow-agreement with a third
party investor that occurred contemporaneous with SFR mortgage loan sales to GSEs. The Company does not expect to resume
sales under the flow-agreement, as the Company has discontinued its mortgage banking activities.
During the first half of 2018, the Company sold $28.5 million of MSRs on approximately $3.55 billion in unpaid principal
balances of conventional agency mortgage loans for cash consideration of $30.1 million, subject to a prepayment protection
provision and standard representations and warranties. The sale of MSRs resulted in a net loss of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to transaction costs, provision for early repayments of loans, and expected repurchase obligations under standard representations and warranties.
The following table presents a composition of servicing rights, on a consolidated operations basis, as of the dates indicated:

December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $96.4 million and $101.0 million, respectively.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, MSRs of $66 thousand and $29.8 million, respectively, were held for sale and valued based on a market bid adjusted for expected repurchase obligations under standard representations and warranties as a
Level 3 fair value measurement.
The value of retained MSRs is generally estimated based on a valuation from a third party provider that calculates the present
value of the expected net servicing income from the portfolio based on key factors that include interest rates, prepayment
assumptions, discount rate and estimated cash flows. The following table presents the key characteristics, inputs and economic
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the MSRs as of the dates indicated:

Senior Notes
On April 6, 2015, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25 percent senior notes due April 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes). Net proceeds after discounts were approximately $172.8 million.
The Senior Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured debt obligations and rank equally with all of the Company’s other present and future unsecured unsubordinated obligations. The Company makes interest payments on the Senior Notes semi-annually in arrears. 
The Company may, at its option, on or after January 15, 2025 (i.e., 90 days prior to the maturity date of the Senior Notes), redeem the Senior Notes in whole at any time or in part from time to time, in each case on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice. The Senior Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
The Senior Notes were issued under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, dated as of April 23, 2012 (the Base Indenture), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 6, 2015 (the Supplemental Indenture and together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture). The Indenture contains several covenants which, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to dispose of or incur liens on the voting stock of certain subsidiaries and also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Indenture at December 31, 2018.
On April 15, 2016, the Company completed the redemption of all of its outstanding 7.5 percent senior notes due April 15, 2020 at a redemption price of 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a debt redemption cost of $2.7 million in All Other Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Tangible Equity Units - Junior Subordinated Amortizing Notes
On May 21, 2014, the Company issued and sold $69.0 million of 8.00 percent tangible equity units (TEUs) in an underwritten public offering. A total of 1,380,000 TEUs were issued, including 180,000 TEUs issued to the underwriter upon exercise of its overallotment option, with each TEU having a stated amount of $50.00. Each TEU was comprised of (i) a prepaid stock purchase contract (each a Purchase Contract) settled by delivery of a specified number of shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) a junior subordinated amortizing note due May 15, 2017 (each an Amortizing Note) that had an initial principal amount of $10.604556 per Amortizing Note, bore interest at a rate of 7.50 percent per annum and had a final installment payment date of May 15, 2017.
The Purchase Contracts and Amortizing Notes were accounted for separately. The Purchase Contract component of the TEUs was recorded in Additional Paid in Capital on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Amortizing Note component was recorded in Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The relative fair values of the Amortizing Notes and Purchase Contracts were estimated to be approximately $14.6 million and $54.4 million, respectively, at the date of issuance. Total issuance costs associated with the TEUs were $4.0 million (including the underwriter discount of $3.3 million), of which $857 thousand was allocated to the debt component and $3.2 million was allocated to the equity component of the TEUs. The portion of the issuance costs allocated to the debt component of the TEUs was amortized over the term of the Amortizing Notes.
On each August 15, November 15, February 15 and May 15, commencing on August 15, 2014, the Company paid holders of Amortizing Notes equal quarterly cash installments of $1.00 per Amortizing Note (or, in the case of the installment payment due on August 15, 2014, $0.933333 per Amortizing Note) (such installments, the installment payments), which installment payments in the aggregate were equivalent to a 8.00 percent cash distribution per year with respect to each $50.00 stated amount of TEUs. Each installment payment constituted a payment of interest (at a rate of 7.50 percent per annum) and a partial repayment of principal on each Amortizing Note.
156

On May 15, 2017, the Company made the final installment payment on the Amortizing Notes and all Purchase Contracts that had not previously been settled were settled. See Note 18 for additional information.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the recorded income tax expense (benefit) of continuing operations to the amount of taxes computed by applying the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate of 21.0 percent to income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 35.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

Other, net | 3.3 | % | | (2.7 | )% | 0.6 | % 
Effective tax rates | 10.3 | % | | (98.8 | )% | 13.7 | % 

The Company’s effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly due to the reduction in the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships of $9.6 million, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $1.0 million related to investments in alternative energy partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $38.2 million of tax credits recognized, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The reduction in tax credits received by the Bank on the investments in alternative energy partnerships is due to less new equipment being placed into service by the investments. The higher effective tax rate was also partially offset by the decrease in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became effective on January 1, 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was lower than the effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 mainly due to the increase in the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships of $38.2 million, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $6.7 million related to investments in alternative energy partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $33.4 million of tax credits recognized, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The lower pre-tax book income of $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $149.4 million for 2016 also enlarged the impact of the tax credits to the effective tax rate. The Company uses the flow-through income statement method to account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnerships. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax difference in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law in the United States. The legislation provides for significant changes to the IRC that impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction of the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35 percent to 21 percent and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions. As of
December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the reduced federal corporate
income tax rate of 21 percent which resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.1 million to continuing operations. At December 31,
2017, the Company was able to make reasonable estimates of the tax effects on enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and
completed its analysis for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act on all items. 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had $2.2 million of available unused federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that may be applied against future taxable income through 2031. The Company had available at December 31, 2018, $9.1 million of unused state NOL carryforwards that may be applied against future taxable income through 2031. Utilization of these NOL carryforwards are subject to annual limitations set forth in Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The tax attributes acquired in Gateway Bancorp acquisitions are subject to an annual IRC Section 382 limitation of $474 thousand. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had income tax credit carryforwards of $26.9 million and $27.4 million, respectively. The tax credits, if unused, will expire on December 31, 2037. 
The following table presents the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the dates indicated:
 | December 31,
($ in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017
Deferred tax assets: | | | 
Allowance for loan and lease losses | $ | 18,813 | | | $ | 15,178

Deferred tax liabilities: | | | 
Investments in partnerships | (5,317 | ) | | (237 | )
Mortgage servicing rights | (520 | ) | | (9,337 | )
Deferred loan fees and costs | (8,528 | ) | | (7,005 | )
Depreciation on premises and equipment | (4,710 | ) | | (3,797 | )
Unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale | — | | | (2,368 | )
Other deferred tax liabilities | (2,635 | ) | | (2,474 | )
Total deferred tax liabilities | (21,710 | ) | | (25,218 | )
Valuation allowance | — | | | — | 
Net deferred tax assets | $ | 49,404 | | | $ | 31,074

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management will continue to evaluate both positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis, including the reversal of its taxable temporary differences, the existence of its historical earnings, the amounts of future projected earnings as well as the tax expiration periods of its income tax credits. Based on this analysis, management determined that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized. Therefore, the Company recorded no valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Based on this analysis, management determined that it was more likely than not the Company believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize net deferred tax assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, estimated taxable income before utilization of NOLs of $64.5 million allowed the Company to utilize $474 thousand and $1.4 million, respectively, of federal and state NOLs (representing approximately 16.8 percent of the total NOLs included in the Company’s deferred tax assets), $9.6 million of alternative energy investment tax credits, $400 thousand of Federal research credits, and $500 thousand of state research tax credits. The Company believes that the utilization of a significant portion of tax credits in 2018, along with the Company’s projection of future taxable income should be considered significant positive evidence that the deferred tax assets for income tax credits will be realized in future periods prior to their expiration dates.
ASC 740-10-25 relates to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. ASC 740-10-25 prescribes a threshold and a measurement process for recognizing in the financial statements a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company does not believe that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized tax benefit that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $1.0 million.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties, respectively. The table below summarizes the activity related to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated:

 | Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Beginning balance | $ | 1,047 | | | $ | — | | $ | —
Increase related to prior year tax positions | — | | | 867 | | | —
Increase in current year tax positions | 180 | | | 180 | | | —
Ending balance | $ | 1,227 | | | $ | 1,047 | | $ | —

In the event the Company is assessed interest and/or penalties by federal or state tax authorities, such amounts will be classified on the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to examination by U.S. federal taxing authorities for years before 2015. The statute of limitations for the assessment of California franchise taxes has expired for tax years before 2014 (other state income and franchise tax statutes of limitations vary by state).
The Company accounts for qualified affordable housing investments under the proportional amortization method. The gross investments in these limited partnerships amounted to $29.3 million and the unfunded portion was $11.5 million at December 31, 2018. The balances of these investments were $20.0 million and $22.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company utilized $1.9 million of tax deductions from these investments in 2018, but the $1.8 million of low income housing tax credits generated in 2018 were limited and not utilized in 2018. Thus, there were $2.7 million and $849 thousand of unused tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Investment book proportional amortization amounted to $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $394 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02 effective January 1, 2018. ASU 2018-02 permits companies to reclassify stranded
tax effects due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. As a result of
the adoption, the Company recorded an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $496 thousand and reduced
retained earnings by $496 thousand to eliminate the stranded tax effects at that date from the reduction in the federal statutory
tax rate that was enacted in December 2017 and became effective January 1, 2018.

NOTE 14 – RESERVE FOR LOSS ON REPURCHASED LOANS
The Company records a representation and warranty reserve representing its estimate of losses expected on mortgage loan repurchases or loss reimbursements attributable to underwriting or documentation defects on previously sold loans. The reserve for loss on repurchased loans is initially recorded at fair value against net revenue on mortgage banking activities at the time of sale, and any subsequent change in the reserve is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an increase or decrease to the provision for loan repurchases (noninterest expense). The following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for losses on repurchased loans for the periods indicated:
 | Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Balance at beginning of year | $ | 6,306 | | | $ | 7,974 | | | $ | 9,700
Initial provision for loan repurchases | 126 | | | 1,622 | | | 3,942 | 
Subsequent change in the reserve | (2,488 | ) | | (1,812 | ) | | (3,352 | )
Utilization of reserve for loan repurchases | (1,438 | ) | | (2,238 | ) | | (2,316 | )
Other adjustments | — | | | 760 | | | — | 
Balance at end of year | $ | 2,506 | | | $ | 6,306 | | | $ | 7,974

During the year ended December 31, 2018, reserve for loss on repurchased loans decreased by $3.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was due to portfolio run-off and repurchase settlement activities.
The Company believes that its obligations for mortgage loan repurchases or loss reimbursements were adequately reserved for
at December 31, 2018.
NOTE 15 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative instruments and other risk management techniques to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with its risk management policies.
Derivative Instruments Related to Mortgage Banking Activities: In connection with mortgage banking activities, if interest rates increase, the value of the Company’s loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held-for-sale are adversely impacted. The Company attempts to economically hedge the risk of the overall change in the fair value of loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held-for-sale with forward loan sale contracts and TBA mortgage-backed securities trades. Forward contracts on loan sale commitments, TBA mortgage-based securities trades, and loan commitments to borrowers are non-designated derivative instruments and the gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments are included in Net Revenue on Mortgage Banking Activities in the Statement of Operations of discontinued operations. The fair value of resulting derivative assets and liabilities are included in Other Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Statement of Financial Condition of discontinued operations.
The net gains (losses) relating to these derivative instruments used for mortgage banking activities, which were included in Net Revenue on Mortgage Banking Activities in the Statement of Operations of discontinued operations, were $0, $(12.4) million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2018, the Company had no outstanding derivative instruments related to mortgage banking activities.
Interest Rate Swaps and Caps on Loans: The Company offers interest rate swap and cap products to certain loan customers to allow them to hedge the risk of rising interest rates on their variable rate loans. When such products are issued, the Company also enters into an offsetting swap with institutional counterparties to eliminate the interest rate risk. These back-to-back agreements are intended to offset each other and allow the Company to retain the credit risk of the transaction with its customer in exchange for a fee. The net cash flow for the Company is equal to the interest income received from a variable rate loan originated with the customer plus the fee. These swaps and caps are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in Other Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. The changes in fair value are recorded in Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, changes in fair value recorded through Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations were insignificant.
161

Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Company offers short-term foreign exchange contracts to its customers to purchase and/or sell foreign currencies at set rates in the future. These products allow customers to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk of their deposits and loans denominated in foreign currencies. In conjunction with these products the Company also enters into offsetting contracts with institutional counterparties to hedge the Company’s foreign exchange rate risk. These back-to-back contracts allow the Company to offer its customers foreign exchange products while minimizing its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in Other Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
The following table presents the notional amount and fair value of derivative instruments included in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of the dates indicated. Note 3 contains further disclosures pertaining to the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives.
 | December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017 
($ in thousands) | Notional Amount | | Fair Value | Notional Amount | | Fair Value 
Included in assets: | | | | | | 
Interest rate swaps and cap on loans | $ | 103,812 | | $ | 1,534 | | $ | 70,486 | $ | 1,005
Total included in assets | $ | 103,812 | | $ | 1,534 | | $ | 70,486 | $ | 1,005

Interest rate swaps and caps on loans | $ | 103,812 | | $ | 1,600 | | $ | 70,486 | $ | 1,033
Total included in liabilities | $ | 103,812 | | $ | 1,600 | | $ | 70,486 | $ | 1,033

The Company has entered into agreements with counterparty financial institutions, which include master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with a single counterparty in the event of default. However, the Company elected to account for all derivatives with counterparty institutions on a gross basis. Due to clearinghouse rule changes, beginning January 1, 2017, variation margin payments are treated as settlements of derivative exposure rather than as collateral.

NOTE 16 – EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION
On May 31, 2018 (the Effective Date), the Company's stockholders approved the Company's 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive
Plan (2018 Omnibus Plan). As of the Effective Date, the Company discontinued granting awards under the Company’s 2013
Omnibus Incentive Plan (2013 Omnibus Plan) or any prior equity incentive plans and future stock-based compensation awards
to its directors and employees will be made pursuant to the 2018 Omnibus Plan. The 2018 Omnibus Plan provides that the
maximum number of shares that will be available for awards is 4,417,882, which represents the number of shares that were
available for new awards under the 2013 Omnibus Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date. As of December 31, 2018,
4,346,189 shares were available for future awards.
On December 28, 2017, the Company initiated the termination of the Banc of California Capital and Liquidity Enhancement
Employee Compensation Trust, a Maryland statutory trust (the SECT), which was established to fund employee stock
compensation and benefit obligations of the Company. The termination of the SECT was completed during the quarter ended
September 30, 2018. See Note 17 for additional information.

Stock option awards | $ | 148 | | | 1.4 years
Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units | 9,037 | | | 2.2 years
Total | $ | 9,185 | | | 2.2 years

Stock Options
The Company has issued stock options to certain employees, officers and directors. Stock options are issued at the closing market price immediately before the grant date, and generally have a three to five year vesting period and contractual terms of seven to ten years. The Company recognizes an income tax deduction upon exercise of a stock option to the extent taxable income is recognized by the option holder. In the case of a non-qualified stock option, the option holder recognizes taxable income based on the fair market value of the shares acquired at the time of exercise less the exercise price.
The weighted-average estimated fair value per share options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions.
 | Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands, except per share data) | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
Granted date fair value of options granted | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 1,630

Cash received from options exercised | $ | — | | $ | 2,043 | $ | — 
Weighted-average estimated fair value per share of options granted | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 5.09 

Expected volatility was determined based on the historical monthly volatility of our stock price over a period equal to the expected term of the options granted. The expected term of the options represents the period that options granted are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the historical exercise behavior associated with previous options grants. The risk-free

interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted.

Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units
The Company also has granted restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to certain employees, officers and directors. The restricted stock awards and units are valued at the closing price of the Company’s stock on the measurement date. The restricted stock awards and units fully vest after a specified period (generally ranging from one to five years) of continued service from the date of grant plus, in some cases, the satisfaction of performance conditions. These performance targets include conditions relating to the Company’s profitability and regulatory standing. The actual amounts of stock released upon vesting will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors upon the Committee's certification of the satisfaction of the target level of performance. The Company recognizes an income tax deduction in an amount equal to the taxable income reported by the holders of the restricted stock, generally upon vesting or, in the case of restricted stock units, when settled. The following table presents unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units activity as of and for the periods indicated:

Stock Appreciation Rights
On August 21, 2012, the Company granted to Steven A. Sugarman, its then- (now former) chief executive officer a ten-year stock appreciation right (SAR) for 500,000 shares (Initial SAR) of the Company’s common stock with a base price of $12.12 per share with one-third of the Initial SAR vesting on the grant date and the remaining amount vesting over a period of 2 years. The Initial SAR entitles Mr. Sugarman to dividend equivalent rights and originally contained an anti-dilution provision pursuant to which additional SARs (Additional SARs) were issued to Mr. Sugarman upon certain stock issuances by the Company, as described below. On March 24, 2016, concurrent with entering into a new employment agreement with the Company, Mr. Sugarman entered into a letter agreement that eliminated this anti-dilution provision of the Initial SAR. Under the terms of the March 24, 2016 letter agreement, in consideration of the removal of the anti-dilution provision of the Initial SAR, the Company granted Mr. Sugarman a onetime performance based restricted stock award with an aggregate grant date fair market value of $5.0 million, which would vest in full on March 24, 2017, but was also subject to restrictions on sale or transfer through March 24, 2021. In connection with Mr. Sugarman’s resignation as the Company’s chief executive officer on January 23, 2017, all unvested equity awards (including any unvested SARs) immediately vested and became free of all restrictions. In addition, the SARs continued (and continue) to remain exercisable for their full terms, with dividend equivalent rights of the SARs also continuing in effect during their full terms.
As described more fully in the SAR agreement, the original anti-dilution provision of the Initial SAR did not apply to certain issuances of the Company’s common stock for compensatory purposes, but did apply to certain other issuances of the Company’s common stock, including the issuances of common stock to raise capital. Pursuant to this anti-dilution provision, the Company issued Additional SARs to the former chief executive officer with a base price determined as of each date of issuance, but otherwise with the same terms and conditions as the Initial SAR, except for an Additional SAR granted relating to a public offering of the Company’s TEUs on May 21, 2014 that has different terms (Additional TEU SAR).
Regarding the Additional TEU SAR, each TEU contained a Purchase Contract that could be settled in shares of the Company’s voting common stock based on a maximum settlement rate (subject to adjustment) and a minimum settlement rate (subject to adjustment) as more fully described under Note 18. The Additional TEU SAR was calculated using the initial maximum settlement rate and, therefore, the number of shares underlying the Additional TEU SAR was subject to adjustment and forfeiture if the aggregate number of shares of stock issued in settlement of any single Purchase Contract was less than the initial maximum settlement rate.
166

By its original terms, the Additional TEU SAR was to vest in full on May 15, 2017 or accelerate in vesting upon early settlement of a Purchase Contract at the holders' option, and until it vested, the Additional TEU SAR was to have no dividend equivalent rights and the shares underlying the Additional TEU SAR were subject to forfeiture.

NOTE 17 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401(k) plan whereby all employees generally can participate in the plan. Employees may contribute up to 100 percent of their compensation subject to certain limits based on federal tax laws. The Company makes an enhanced safe-harbor matching contribution equal to 100 percent of the first 4 percent of the employee’s deferral rate not to exceed 4 percent of the employee’s compensation. The safe-harbor matching contribution is fully vested by the participant when made.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, expense attributable to 401(k) plans amounted to $2.1 million, $3.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
The Company has adopted a Deferred Compensation Plan under Section 401 of the IRC. The purpose of this plan is to provide specified benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees. Participants may elect to defer compensation, which accrues interest quarterly at the Prime Rate as of the last business day of the prior quarter. The Company does not make contributions to the Plan.
Employee Equity Ownership Plan
The Company established the Employee Equity Ownership Plan (EEOP) effective October 15, 2013 for the benefit of employees. The EEOP is administered under the Company’s 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and the awards thereunder are issued upon the terms and conditions and subject to the restrictions of the Company’s 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. The EEOP provides that employees eligible to receive restricted stock awards or units under the EEOP are any employees who are not otherwise given shares pursuant to any other Company-sponsored equity program, with grants generally vesting in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. After evaluation of all then-current equity plans, the Company discontinued the Employee Equity Ownership Program (“EEOP”) effective January 1, 2018.  On April 2, 2018, all final stock awards due under the EEOP were granted to eligible employees, including employees who were eligible for a five-year service award during 2018 calendar year.  
The Company issued 72,561, 35,016 and 98,693 shares with respect to restricted stock awards and units under the EEOP for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. At December 31, 2018, there were 83,900 unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units with an unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million. 
NOTE 18 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Warrants
On November 1, 2010, the Company issued warrants to TCW Shared Opportunity Fund V, L.P. for up to 240,000 shares of non-voting common stock at an original exercise price of $11.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments to the number of shares underlying the warrants as well as certain adjustments to the warrant exercise price as applicable. These warrants were exercisable from the date of original issuance through November 1, 2015. On August 3, 2015, these warrants were exercised in full using a cashless (net) exercise, resulting in a net number of shares of non-voting common stock issued in the aggregate of 70,690, which were immediately thereafter exchanged pursuant to a separate exchange agreement entered into on May 29, 2013 for an aggregate of 70,690 shares of voting common stock. Based on automatic adjustments to the original $11.00 exercise price, the exercise price at the time of exercise of the warrants was $9.13 per share.
On November 1, 2010, the Company also issued warrants to COR Advisors LLC (COR Advisors), an entity controlled by Steven A. Sugarman, who became a director of the Company on that date and later became President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (and resigned from those and all other positions with the Company and the Bank on January 23, 2017). The warrants entitled COR Advisors to purchase up to 1,395,000 shares of non-voting common stock at an exercise price of $11.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments to the number of shares underlying the warrants as well as certain adjustments to the warrant exercise price as applicable. On August 3, 2011, COR Advisors transferred warrants for the right to purchase 960,000 shares of non-voting common stock to COR Capital Holdings LLC (COR Capital Holdings), an entity controlled by Steven A. Sugarman, and transferred warrants for the right to purchase the remaining 435,000 shares of non-voting common stock to Jeffrey T. Seabold, then- (now former) Executive Vice President and Management Vice-Chair. 
On August 22, 2012, COR Capital Holdings transferred its warrants for the right to purchase 960,000 shares of non-voting common stock to a living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse. These warrants vested in tranches, with each tranche being exercisable for five years after the tranche’s vesting date. With respect to the warrants transferred by COR Capital Holdings to the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse, warrants to purchase 50,000 shares vested on October 1, 2011 and the remainder vested in seven equal quarterly installments beginning January 1, 2012 and ending on July 1, 2013. With respect to the warrants transferred by COR Advisors to Mr. Seabold, warrants to purchase 95,000 shares vested on January 1, 2011; warrants to acquire 130,000 shares vested on each of April 1 and July 1, 2011, and warrants to purchase 80,000 shares vested on October 1, 2011.
168

On August 17, 2016, the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse transferred warrants to purchase 480,000 shares to Steven A. Sugarman's brother, Jason Sugarman. These transferred warrants were last exercisable on September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 for 50,000, 130,000, 130,000, 130,000, and 40,000 shares, respectively. On August 17, 2016, Jason Sugarman irrevocably elected to fully exercise each tranche of the transferred warrants. Under his irrevocable election, Jason Sugarman directed that each such exercise would occur on the last exercisable date for each tranche using a cashless (net) exercise method and also directed that each exercise be for either non-voting common stock, or, if allowed under the terms of the warrant, for voting common stock. 
At September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, in accordance with Jason Sugarman’s irrevocable election, warrants to purchase 50,000, 130,000, 130,000, 130,000, and 40,000 shares, respectively, had been exercised, resulting in issuances of 25,051 and 64,962 shares of the Company's voting common stock and 75,875, 77,376 and 23,237 shares of the Company's non-voting common stock, respectively. Based on automatic adjustments to the original $11.00 exercise price, the exercise price at the time of exercise was $8.80, $8.72, $8.66, $8.61 and $8.55 per share, respectively. As a result of these exercises, Jason Sugarman no longer holds any warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s stock. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, based on additional documentation received from Jason Sugarman, it was determined that Jason Sugarman was eligible to receive voting common stock under the terms of the transferred warrant for the exercises that previously occurred on March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017. Accordingly, on June 6, 2018, an aggregate of 176,488 shares of the Company's non-voting common stock owned by Jason Sugarman were canceled and he was issued 176,488 shares of the Company's voting common stock in lieu thereof.
On August 16, 2016, the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse irrevocably elected to exercise its warrants to purchase 480,000 shares. Under its irrevocable election, the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse directed that each such exercise would occur on the last exercisable date for each tranche of such warrants (September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 with respect to 90,000, 130,000, 130,000, and 130,000 shares, respectively) using a cashless net exercise method and also directed that each exercise be for non-voting common stock. On September 30, 2017, in accordance with its irrevocable election, warrants to purchase 90,000 shares were exercised by the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse, resulting in the issuance of 52,284 shares of the Company's non-voting common stock. Based on an automatic adjustment to the original $11.00 exercise price, the exercise price at the time of exercise was $8.55 per share. 
On December 27, 2017, March 30, 2018 and June 29, 2018, the Company was notified that the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse purportedly transferred warrants with respect to 130,000 shares, with a last exercisable date of December 31, 2017, 130,000 shares with a last exercisable date of March 31, 2018 and 130,000 shares with a last exercisable
date of June 30, 2018, respectively, to a separate entity, Sugarman Family Partners. In accordance with the irrevocable election to exercise previously submitted by the living trust for Steven A. Sugarman and his spouse, the Company considered these transferred warrants to have been exercised with respect to 130,000 shares on December 31, 2017, 130,000 shares on March
31, 2018 and 130,000 shares on June 30, 2018, respectively, resulting in the issuance of 77,413, 72,159, and 73,543 shares of the Company's non-voting common stock, respectively, on December 31, 2017, April 2, 2018 and July 2, 2018, respectively. Based on an automatic adjustment to the original $11.00 exercise price, the exercise price at the time of exercise was $8.49 per share, $8.44 per share and $8.38 per share, respectively. As a result of these exercises, none of these warrants remain
outstanding.
On December 8, 2015, March 9, 2016, June 17, 2016, and September 30, 2016, Mr. Seabold exercised his warrants with respect to 95,000, 130,000, 130,000, and 80,000 shares, respectively, using cashless (net) exercises, resulting in a net number of shares of non-voting common stock issued in the aggregate of 37,355, 53,711, 70,775, and 40,081, respectively. Based on automatic adjustments to the original $11.00 exercise price, the exercise price at the time of exercise was $9.04, $8.90, $8.84, and $8.80 per share, respectively. As a result of these exercises, Mr. Seabold no longer holds any warrants to purchase shares of the Company's stock.
Under the terms of the respective warrants, the warrants were exercisable for voting common stock in lieu of non-voting common stock following a transfer of the warrants under certain circumstances described in the terms of the warrants. The terms and issuance of the foregoing warrants were approved by the Company's stockholders at a special meeting held on October 25, 2010.

Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with par value of $0.01 per share. Preferred shares outstanding rank senior to common shares both as to dividends and liquidation preference but generally have no voting rights. All of the Company's outstanding shares of preferred stock have a $1,000 per share liquidation preference. The following table presents the Company's total outstanding preferred stock as of dates indicated:
 | December 31, 
 | 2018 | 2017 
($ in thousands) | Shares Authorized and Outstanding | Liquidation Preference | | Carrying Value | Shares Authorized and Outstanding | | Liquidation Preference | | Carrying Value

On September 17, 2018, the Company completed the redemption of all 40,250 outstanding shares of the Company's 8.00 percent Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series C Preferred Stock), which resulted in the simultaneous
redemption of all 1,610,000 of the outstanding related depositary shares (Series C Depository Shares), each representing a
1/40th interest in a share of Series C Preferred Stock, at a redemption price of the liquidation amount of $1,000 per share of
Series C Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per Series C Depository Share). The redemption price represented an aggregate
amount of $40.3 million and did not accrue interest from and following the regularly scheduled dividend payment date of
September 15, 2018. Deferred stock issuance costs of $2.3 million originally recorded as a reduction to preferred stock upon
issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock were reclassified to retained earnings and resulted in a one-time, non-cash reduction to
net income allocated to common stockholders. This affected the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share
for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 21 for additional information.
On April 8, 2015, the Company completed the issuance and sale, in an underwritten public offering, of 4,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 7.375 percent Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), for gross proceeds of $96.9 million. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 depositary shares to cover over-allotments, which the underwriters exercised in full concurrently, resulting in additional gross proceeds of $14.5 million. A total of 115,000 shares of Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock were issued.
On February 8, 2016, the Company completed the issuance and sale, in an underwritten public offering, of 5,000,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of its 7.00 percent Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E (with 125,000 shares of Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock issued), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), for gross proceeds of $121.1 million.
On April 1, 2016, the Company completed the redemption of all 32,000 outstanding shares of the Company's Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and all 10,000 outstanding shares of the Company's Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B. The shares were redeemed at a redemption price equal to the liquidation amount of $1,000 per share plus the unpaid dividends for the current dividend period to, but excluding, the redemption date. Both the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B preferred Stock were issued as part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund Program.
Stock Employee Compensation Trust
On August 3, 2016, the Company established the SECT pursuant to the Trust Agreement, dated as of August 3, 2016 (the SECT Trust Agreement), between the Company and Newport Trust Company, as trustee (as successor trustee to Evercore Trust Company, N.A.) (the SECT Trustee) to fund employee compensation and benefit obligations of the Company using shares of the Company’s common stock. On August 3, 2016, the Company sold 2,500,000 shares of voting common stock to the SECT at a purchase price of $21.45 per share (the closing price of the voting common stock on August 2, 2016), or $53.6 million in the aggregate, in exchange for a cash amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares and a promissory note for the balance of the purchase price. The SECT was to terminate on January 1, 2032 unless terminated earlier in accordance with the SECT Trust Agreement, including by the Company’s Board of Directors.
On December 28, 2017, in order to effectuate the early termination of the SECT, as authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company purchased from the SECT all 2,500,000 shares of voting common stock held by the SECT at a 
170

purchase price of $21.00 per share (the closing price per share of the voting common stock on December 27, 2017), or $52.5 million in the aggregate (the SECT Termination Sale). Following the SECT Termination Sale, such shares of voting common stock were canceled. Of the proceeds from the SECT Termination Sale, $2.7 million was to be utilized for the purpose of funding obligations under certain of the Company’s benefit plans to which 126,517 shares of voting common stock had been allocated prior to the SECT Termination Sale, and $49.8 million was remitted by the SECT Trustee to the Company, which was deemed to be in satisfaction and termination of all remaining obligations of the SECT under the promissory note, which had an outstanding principal balance of $50.9 million plus accrued interest. During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the
remaining cash balance in the SECT, including the aforementioned proceeds of $2.7 million from the SECT Termination Sale,
was disbursed from the SECT to the Company to fund the Company's 401(k) plan as well as health and welfare plans. The
termination of the SECT was completed upon the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the Maryland Department of
Assessments and Taxation on September 24, 2018.
Tangible Equity Units - Prepaid Stock Purchase Contracts
On May 21, 2014, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 1,380,000 of its tangible equity units (TEUs), which included 180,000 TEUs issued to the underwriter upon the full exercise of its over-allotment option, resulting in net proceeds of $65.0 million. The relative fair values of the Amortizing Notes and Purchase Contracts were estimated to be $14.6 million and $54.4 million, respectively, at the date of issuance. Total issuance costs associated with the TEUs were $4.0 million, of which $857 thousand was allocated to the debt component and $3.2 million was allocated to the equity component of the TEUs.
Each TEU was comprised of a Purchase Contract and an Amortizing Note. The terms of the Purchase Contracts provided that unless settled early at the holder’s option as described below, on May 15, 2017, each Purchase Contract would automatically settle and the Company would deliver a number of shares of its voting common stock based on the then-applicable market value of the voting common stock, ranging from an initial minimum settlement rate of 4.4456 shares per Purchase Contract (subject to adjustment) if the applicable market value is equal to or greater than $11.247 per share to an initial maximum settlement rate of 5.1124 shares per Purchase Contract (subject to adjustment) if the applicable market value is less than or equal to $9.78 per share.
From the first business day following the issuance of the TEUs, excluding the third business day immediately preceding May 15, 2017, a holder of a Purchase Contract could settle its Purchase Contract early, and the Company would deliver to the holder 4.4456 shares of voting common stock. On May 15, 2017, all Purchase Contracts that had not previously been settled early as described above were settled. The Company issued an aggregate of 6,134,988 shares of voting common stock pursuant to the Purchase Contracts. See Note 12 for additional information.

NOTE 19 – REGULATORY CAPITAL MATTERS
The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were then subject. With respect to the Bank, prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If only adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and a capital restoration plan is required. At December 31, 2018, the most recent regulatory notification categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution’s category.
The following table presents the regulatory capital amounts and ratios for the Company and the Bank as of dates indicated:
 | | | Minimum Capital Requirements | | Minimum Required to Be Well-Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions

In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule strengthens the definition of regulatory capital, increases risk-based capital requirements, makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets, and adjusts the prompt corrective action thresholds. The Company and the Bank became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015 and certain provisions of the new rule were phased in through 2019. The final provision related to this follows implements a new capital conservation buffer requirement for a banking organization to maintain a common equity capital ratio more than 2.5 percent above the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in, beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625 percent, with additional 0.625 percent increments annually, and became fully phased in at 2.50 percent on January 1, 2019. Inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, the common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratio minimums are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. A banking organization with a buffer of less than the required amount is subject to increasingly stringent limitations on such distributions and payments as the buffer approaches zero. The new rule also generally prohibits a banking organization from making such distributions or payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative and its capital conservation buffer ratio was 2.5 percent or less at the end of the previous quarter. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income.
Dividend Restrictions
The Company’s principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Federal banking laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, in the case of the Bank, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year’s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements described above. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $104.3 million available to pay dividends to the Company without prior OCC approval. However, any dividend granted by the Bank would be limited by the need to maintain its well capitalized status plus the capital buffer in order to avoid additional dividend restrictions. In addition to dividends on its preferred stock, the Company declared and paid dividends on its common stock of $0.13 per share for each of the quarters of 2018. The Bank paid dividends of $94.3 million to Banc of California, Inc. during the year ended December 31, 2018.
NOTE 20 – VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
The Company holds ownership interests in alternative energy partnerships, qualified affordable housing partnerships, and held an interest in the SECT prior to the termination of the SECT. The Company evaluates its interests in these entities to determine whether they meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Company is required to consolidate these entities. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest the Company holds could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of the Company's involvement with the VIE. The Company has determined that its interests in these entities meet the definition of a variable interest.
Unconsolidated VIEs
Alternative Energy Partnerships
The Company invests in certain alternative energy partnerships (limited liability companies) formed to provide sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits (energy tax credits). These entities were formed to invest in newly installed residential rooftop solar leases and power purchase agreements. As a result of its investments, the Company has the right to certain investment tax credits and tax depreciation benefits (recognized on the flow through and income statement method in accordance with ASC 740), and to a lesser extent, cash flows generated from the installed solar systems leased to individual consumers for a fixed period of time.
While the Company's interest in the alternative energy partnerships meets the definition of a VIE in accordance with ASC 810, the Company has determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary because the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities including operational and credit risk management activities. As the Company is not the primary beneficiary, the Company did not consolidate the entities. The Company uses the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) method to account for these investments in energy tax credits as an equity investment under ASC 970-323-25-17. Under the HLBV method, an equity method investor determines its share of an investee's earnings by comparing its claim on the investee's book value at the beginning and end of the period, assuming the investee were to liquidate all assets at their U.S. GAAP amounts and distribute the resulting cash to creditors and investors under their respective priorities. The difference between the calculated liquidation distribution amounts at the 
173

beginning and the end of the reporting period, after adjusting for capital contributions and distributions, is the Company’s share of the earnings or losses from the equity investment for the period. To account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnerships, the Company uses the flow-through income statement method. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax differences in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, The Company funded $0 and $55.4 million, respectively, and recognized a loss on investment of $5.0 million and $30.8 million, respectively, through its HLBV application. As a result, the balance of its investments was $29.0 million and $48.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company completed the funding on one of its investments. While the Company had committed $100.0 million to the investment, the amount that was drawn down and funded by the Company was $62.8 million and the remaining $37.2 million of the commitment was canceled. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Company reached the completion deadline of its remaining investment. While the Company had committed $100.0 million to that investment, the amount that was drawn down and funded by the Company was $49.9 million, of which $1.0 million was unused and returned to the Company, and the remaining $50.1 million of commitment was canceled.
From an income tax benefit perspective, the Company recognized investment tax credits of $9.6 million and $38.2 million, respectively, as well as income tax benefits relating to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The following table represents the carrying value of the associated assets and liabilities and the associated maximum loss exposure for the alternative energy partnerships as of the dates indicated:
 | December 31,
($ in thousands) | 2018 | | 2017
Cash | $ | 3,012 | | | $ | 16,518 
Equipment, net of depreciation | 259,464 | | | 246,297 | 
Other assets | 4,470 | | | 2,444 | 
Total unconsolidated assets | $ | 266,946 | | | $ | 265,259
Total unconsolidated liabilities | $ | 6,269 | | | $ | 7,181 
Maximum loss exposure | $ | 28,988 | | | $ | 98,910 

174

The maximum loss exposure that would be absorbed by the Company in the event that all of the assets in the alternative energy partnerships are deemed worthless is $29.0 million, which is the Company's recorded investment amount at December 31, 2018. 
The Company believes that the loss exposure on its investments is reduced considering its return on its investment is provided not only by the cash flows of the underlying customer leases and power purchase agreements, but also through the significant tax benefits, including federal tax credits generated from the investments. In addition, the arrangements include a transition manager to support any transition of the solar company sponsor whose role includes that of the servicer and operation and maintenance provider, in the event the sponsor would be required to be removed from its responsibilities (e.g., bankruptcy, breach of contract, etc.), thereby further limiting the Company’s exposure.
Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships
The Company invests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects. The returns on these investments are generated primarily through allocated Federal tax credits and other tax benefits. In addition, these investments contribute to the Company's compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. These limited partnerships are considered to be VIEs, because either (i) they do not have sufficient equity investment at risk or (ii) the limited partners with equity at risk do not have substantive kick-out rights through voting rights or substantive participating rights over the general partner. As a limited partner, the Company is not the primary beneficiary because the general partner has the ability to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance. Therefore, the Company does not consolidate these partnerships. 
The Company funded $4.1 million, $4.5 million and $104 thousand, respectively, into these partnerships and recognized proportional amortization expense of $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $394 thousand, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As a result, the balance of these investments was $20.0 million and $22.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had funded $17.8 million of its $29.3 million aggregated funding commitments. The Company had an unfunded commitment of $11.5 million at December 31, 2018. From an income tax benefit perspective, the Company recognized investment tax credits of $1.9 million, $849 thousand and $435 thousand, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The maximum loss exposure that would be absorbed by the Company in the event that all of the assets in this investment are deemed worthless is $20.0 million, which is the Company's recorded investment amount at December 31, 2018. The recorded investment amount is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the proportional amortization expense is recorded in Income Tax (Benefit) Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
As the investments in alternative energy partnerships and qualified affordable housing partnerships represent unconsolidated VIEs to the Company, the assets and liabilities of the investments themselves are not recorded on the Company's statements of financial condition.
Consolidated VIE
On August 3, 2016, the Company established the SECT pursuant to the SECT Trust Agreement to fund employee compensation and benefit obligations of the Company using shares of the Company’s common stock. On August 3, 2016, the Company sold 2,500,000 shares of voting common stock to the SECT at a purchase price of $21.45 per share (the closing price of the voting common stock on August 2, 2016), or $53.6 million in the aggregate, in exchange for a cash amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares and a promissory note for the balance of the purchase price. The SECT was to terminate on January 1, 2032 unless terminated earlier in accordance with the SECT Trust Agreement, including by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The Company evaluated its interest in the SECT and determined that it was a VIE for which the Company was the primary beneficiary. As such, the SECT was consolidated by the Company. The entire amount of assets and liabilities of the SECT represented the transactions between the Company and the SECT. As a result, the note receivable on the Company and the note payable on the SECT were eliminated on a consolidated basis. All other transactions, such as note principal and dividend payments and receipts, were also eliminated on a consolidated basis, accordingly. 
On December 28, 2017, in order to effectuate the early termination of the SECT, as authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company purchased from the SECT all 2,500,000 shares of voting common stock held by the SECT. On September 24, 2018, the termination of the SECT was completed. See Note 18 for additional information.

NOTE 22 – LOAN COMMITMENTS AND OTHER RELATED ACTIVITIES
Some financial instruments such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Risk of credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.
The contractual amount of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk was as follows for the dates indicated:
 | December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 
($ in thousands) | Fixed Rate | | Variable Rate | | Fixed Rate | | Variable Rate
Commitments to extend credit (1) | $ | 2,167 | | | $ | 288,770 | | $ | 1,851 | $ | 335,654

(1) | Included no commitments to extend credit related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Commitments to extend credit are generally made for periods of 30 days or less.
Other Commitments
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Bank entered into certain definitive agreements which grant the Bank the exclusive naming rights to the Banc of California Stadium, a soccer stadium of LAFC, as well as the right to be the official bank of LAFC. In exchange for the Bank’s rights as set forth in the agreements, the Bank agreed to pay LAFC $100.0 million over a period of 15 years, beginning in 2017 and ending in 2032. The advertising benefits of such rights are amortized on a straight-line basis and recorded as advertising and promotion expense beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank has paid $15.3 million of the $100.0 million commitment. The prepaid commitment balance, net of amortization, was $8.7 million as of December 31, 2018, which was recognized as a prepaid asset and included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. 
The Company had unfunded commitments of $11.5 million, $8.8 million, and $501 thousand for Affordable Housing Fund Investment, SBIC, and Other Investments at December 31, 2018, respectively.
NOTE 23 – RESTRUCTURING
On June 26, 2018, the Company announced a reduction in force to the Company’s workforce by approximately 9% of total
staffing. In addition, the Company reduced the use of third party advisors during the third and fourth quarters of 2018, with each of these actions intended to align the Company’s cost structure with its focused commercial banking platform. The plan was fully completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company incurred severance-related costs in 2018 aggregating $4.4 million, pre-tax, related to the reduction in force. 
In connection with the sale of its Banc Home Loans division in 2017, the Company restructured certain aspects of its infrastructure and back office operations by realigning back office staffing resulting in certain severance and other employee related costs including accelerated vesting of equity awards, and amending certain system contracts in order to improve the Company's efficiency. These employees and systems primarily supported the Company's mortgage banking activities. The Company recognized $9.1 million of total restructuring expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. 
The Company had outstanding unpaid accrued liabilities of $117 thousand and $202 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following table presents activities in accrued liabilities and related expenses for the restructuring as of or for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively:

NOTE 24 - REVENUE RECOGNITION
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”, and all subsequent amendments. As stated in Note 1, the implementation of the new standard did not have a material impact on the measurement, timing, or recognition of revenue. Accordingly, no cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings was deemed necessary. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under Topic 605.
Topic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including revenue from loans and securities. In addition, certain noninterest income streams such as gain or loss associated with mortgage servicing rights, financial guarantees, derivatives, and income from bank owned life insurance are also not within the scope of the new guidance. Topic 606 is applicable to noninterest income such as trust and asset management income, deposit related fees, interchange fees, merchant related income, and annuity and insurance commissions. However, the recognition of these revenue streams did not change significantly upon adoption of Topic 606. Noninterest income considered to be within the scope of Topic 606 is discussed below.
Debit Card Fees
When customers use their debit cards to pay merchants for goods or services, the Company retains a fee from the funds collected from the related deposit account and transfers the remaining funds to the payment network for remittance to the merchant. The performance obligation to the merchant is satisfied and the fee is recognized at the point in time when the funds are collected and transferred to the payment network.
Investment Commissions
The Company acts as an agent for a third party vendor that provides investment services and products to customers. Upon completion of a sale of investment services or products to a customer, the Company receives a commission from the third party vendor. The performance obligation to the third party vendor is satisfied and the commission income is recognized at that point in time.
Deposit Service Fees
Service charges on deposit accounts consist of account analysis fees, monthly service fees, check orders, and other deposit related fees. The Company’s performance obligation for account analysis fees and monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. Check orders and other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time as incurred.
Other
Other noninterest income primarily consists of other recurring revenue streams from gains or losses on sales of OREO, and merchant referral commissions. The Company's performance obligation for sale of OREO is the transfer of title and ownership rights of the OREO to the buyer, which occurs at the settlement date when the sale proceeds are received and income is recognized. The Company's performance obligation for merchant referral commissions is satisfied with the successful sale of services to those referred merchants, which is when the commission is received and the income is recognized.
The following presents noninterest income, segregated by revenue streams in-scope and out-of-scope of Topic 606, for the periods indicated.

These loans were made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms and conditions, including interest rates and collateral, as those of comparable transactions with non-insiders prevailing at the time, in accordance with the Bank’s underwriting guidelines, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
The Bank has an Employee Loan Program which is available to all employees and offers executive officers, directors and principal stockholders that meet the eligibility requirements the opportunity to participate on the same terms as employees generally, provided that any loan to an executive officer, director or principal stockholder must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. The sole benefit provided under the Employee Loan Program is a reduction in loan fees. 
Deposits from executive officers, directors, and their related interests amounted to $11.1 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There are certain deposits described below, which are not included in the foregoing amounts.

At the direction of the Company Board, this indemnification, advancement and/or reimbursement is, to the extent applicable, subject to the indemnification agreement that each officer and director previously entered into with the Company, which includes an undertaking to repay any expenses advanced if it is ultimately determined that the officer or director was not entitled to indemnification under such agreements and applicable law. In addition, the Company is providing indemnification, advancement and/or reimbursement for costs related to (i) a formal order of investigation issued by the SEC on January 4, 2017 directed primarily at certain of the issues that the Special Committee reviewed and (ii) any related civil or administrative proceedings against the Company as well as officers currently or previously associated with the Company.

On November 3, 2016, in connection with the investigation by the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, the Company Board authorized and directed the Company to provide indemnification, advancement and/or reimbursement for the costs of separate independent counsel retained by any then-current officer or director, in their individual capacity, with respect to matters related to the investigation, and to advise them on their rights and obligations with respect to the investigation. At the direction of the Company Board, this indemnification, advancement and/or reimbursement is, to the extent applicable, subject to the indemnification agreement that each officer and director previously entered into with the Company, which includes an undertaking to repay any expenses advanced if it is ultimately determined that the officer or director was not entitled to indemnification under such agreements and applicable law. In addition, the Company is also providing indemnification, advancement and/or reimbursement for costs related to (i) a formal order of investigation issued by the SEC on January 4, 2017 directed primarily at certain of the issues that the Special Committee reviewed and (ii) any related civil or administrative proceedings against the Company as well as officers currently or previously associated with the Company.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, indemnification costs paid by the Company included $8.5 million incurred by the Company’s former Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer Steven A. Sugarman; $497 thousand incurred by the Bank’s former Management Vice Chair Jeffrey T. Seabold; $400 thousand jointly incurred by the Company’s former Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer J. Francisco A. Turner and the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer James J. McKinney; $292 thousand incurred by the Bank’s former director Cynthia Abercrombie; and $854 thousand incurred by the Company’s former director Jeffrey Karish. Indemnification costs were paid on behalf of other former executive officers and other former directors in lesser amounts for the year ended December 31, 2018.
During the year ended December 31, 2017 (excluding indemnification costs paid in January 2017), indemnification costs paid by the Company included $3.0 million incurred by Mr. Sugarman; $1.4 million incurred by Mr. Seabold; $631 thousand jointly incurred by the Company’s former Interim Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer J. Francisco A. Turner and the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer James J. McKinney; and $509 thousand incurred by the Company’s former director Chad Brownstein. Indemnification costs were paid on behalf of other former executive officers and other former directors in lesser amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017 (excluding fees paid in January 2017).
For the year ended December 31, 2016, indemnification costs incurred under the arrangement described above (which were paid in January 2017) included $573 thousand incurred by Mr. Sugarman; $57 thousand incurred by Mr. Seabold; $135 thousand incurred jointly by Messrs. Turner and McKinney; and $29 thousand incurred by Mr. Brownstein. Indemnification was paid on behalf of other former executive officers and former directors in lesser amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 (which were paid in January 2017).
Settlement Agreement. On September 5, 2017, Jeffrey T. Seabold, the Bank’s former Management Vice Chair, submitted a notice of termination of employment pursuant to his employment agreement with the Bank and, that same day, filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and the Bank and multiple unnamed defendants asserting claims for breach of contract, wrongful termination, retaliation and unfair business practices. On January 19, 2018, the parties reached a settlement in principle through mediation and a final settlement agreement was entered into by the Company, the Bank and Mr. Seabold on February 14, 2018 (the Settlement Agreement).
Under the Settlement Agreement, which provides for a mutual release of claims and the dismissal of Mr. Seabold’s complaint with prejudice, Mr. Seabold received lump sum cash payments from the Company and the Bank aggregating $4.3 million, less applicable withholdings for the portions of such payments representing employee compensation. Included within this amount 
187

are cash payments totaling $576 thousand representing a benefit with respect to Mr. Seabold's unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. Mr. Seabold also received a cash payment of $38 thousand as reimbursement for his premiums for health care coverage for the period October 1, 2017 through March 2019. In addition, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement the Bank paid $650 thousand of attorneys’ fees incurred by Mr. Seabold in connection with his lawsuit and the Settlement Agreement. All the cash payments to Mr. Seabold under the Settlement Agreement were made during the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Settlement Agreement contains certain standstill provisions that, prior to December 31, 2018, generally restrict Mr. Seabold and his affiliates from, among other things, acquiring beneficial ownership of any shares of the Company’s common stock or common stock equivalents to the extent this would result in Mr. Seabold beneficially owning in excess of 4.99 percent of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding, soliciting proxies in opposition to any matter not recommended by the Company’s Board of Directors or in favor of any matter not approved by the Company’s Board of Directors or initiating any stockholder proposal.
Banc of California Stadium Naming Rights and Sponsorship and Los Angeles Football Club Loans. Effective August 8, 2016, the Bank provided $40.3 million out of a $145.0 million committed construction line of credit (the Stadco Loan) to LAFC Stadium Co, LLC (Stadco) for the construction of a soccer-specific stadium for the LAFC in Los Angeles, California as well as to fund the interest and fees that become due under the Stadco Loan. LAFC is a Major League Soccer expansion franchise that debuted at the beginning of 2018. Also effective August 8, 2016, the Bank provided $9.7 million out of a $35.0 million committed senior secured line of credit (the Team Loan) to LAFC Sports, LLC (Team) to fund distributions to LAFC Partners, LLLP (Holdco) that will be used for stadium construction, funding interest and fees that become due under such Team Loan and to pay all other fees, costs and expenses payable by the Team in connection with project costs related to the stadium construction. 
All of the outstanding equity interests in Stadco and Team are held by Holdco, and Holdco serves as sole guarantor of the Team Loan described above. At the time the Stadco Loan and Team Loan were underwritten, minority limited partnership interests in Holdco were held by, among others: (i) Jason Sugarman, who is the brother of the Company’s and the Bank’s then- (now former) Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steven A. Sugarman; and (ii) Jason Sugarman’s father-in-law, who served during 2016 (and may continue to serve) as Executive Chairman and a member of Holdco’s board of directors, which was (and may continue to be) appointed by Holdco’s general partner and primarily functions in an advisory capacity. The foregoing statements are based primarily on information provided to the Company by Holdco through its legal counsel.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were $0 and $23.3 million outstanding advances, respectively, by the Bank under the Stadco Loan. On August 30, 2018, all outstanding advances under Stadco Loan were paid off. The Bank collected $66 thousand and $295 thousand, respectively, in unused loan fees during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Interest on the outstanding balance under the Stadco Loan accrues at LIBOR plus a margin. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $1.1 million and $325 thousand interest, respectively, was paid by Stadco to the Bank on the Stadco Loan.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were $0 and $5.4 million outstanding advances, respectively, by the Bank under Team Loan. The Bank collected $22 thousand and $140 thousand, respectively, in unused loan fees during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Interest on the outstanding balance under the Team Loan accrues at LIBOR plus a margin. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $471 thousand and $83 thousand interest, respectively, was paid by Team to the Bank on the Team Loan.
Team obtained a corporate credit card with a $100 thousand line of credit from a third party unaffiliated with the Bank. Effective November 24, 2017, the Bank provided a guaranty for the card by obtaining a standby letter of credit issued by another institution unaffiliated with the Bank in the amount of $100 thousand for the benefit of the issuer of the credit card. This letter of credit had never been drawn upon and was terminated during the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
Following the closing of the Stadco Loan and the Term Loan, the Bank on August 22, 2016 reached agreement with the Team concerning, among other things, the Bank’s right to name the stadium to be operated by Stadco as “Banc of California Stadium.” The August 22, 2016 agreement, which contemplated the negotiation and execution of more detailed definitive agreements between the Bank, on the one hand, and Stadco and the Team on the other hand (LAFC Transaction), also included a sponsorship relationship between the Bank and the Team with an initial term ending on the completion date of LAFC’s 15th full Major League Soccer (MLS) season, and the Bank having a right of first offer to extend the term for an additional 10 years (LAFC Term). On February 28, 2017, the Bank executed more detailed definitive agreements with LAFC and Stadco relating to the LAFC Transaction, which are subject to MLS rules and/or approval (the LAFC Agreements).
The LAFC Agreements provide that, during the LAFC Term, the Bank has the exclusive right to name the Banc of California Stadium and has the right to be the exclusive provider of financial services to (and the exclusive financial services sponsor of) the Team and Stadco. In connection with its right to name the Banc of California Stadium, the Bank will receive, among other rights, signage (including prominent exterior signage) and related branding rights throughout the exterior and interior of the Banc of California Stadium facility (including exclusive branding rights within certain designated areas and venues within the facility), receives the right to locate a Bank branch within the Banc of California Stadium facility, and the exclusive right to install and operate ATMs in the Banc of California Stadium facility, receives the exclusive right to process payments and 
188

provide other financial services (with certain exceptions) throughout the facility. In addition, the Bank receives suite access for LAFC and certain other events held at the Banc of California Stadium and receives certain hospitality, event, media and other rights ancillary to its naming rights relating to the Banc of California Stadium and its sponsorship rights relating to the Team. In conjunction with the LAFC Agreements, the Company decreased its other planned marketing and sponsorship expenses.
In exchange for the Bank’s rights as set forth in the LAFC Agreements, the Bank (i) paid the Team $10.0 million on March 31, 2017 and (ii) has agreed to pay the following annual aggregate amounts: for the Team’s 2018 MLS season, $5.3 million; for 2019, $5.4 million; for 2020, $5.5 million; for 2021, $5.6 million; for 2022, $5.7 million; for 2023, $5.8 million; for 2024, $5.9 million; for 2025, $6.0 million; for 2026, $6.1 million; for 2027, $6.2 million; for 2028, $6.3 million; for 2029, $6.4 million; for 2030, $6.5 million; for 2031, $6.6 million; and for 2032, $6.7 million. The advertising benefits of such rights are amortized
on a straight-line basis and recorded as advertising expense beginning in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid $5.3 million for the Team's 2018 MLS season and the related advertising and promotion expense recorded
was $6.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank has paid $15.3 million of the $100.0 million commitment. The prepaid
commitment balance, net of amortization, was $8.7 million as of December 31, 2018, which was recognized as a prepaid asset
and included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the various entities affiliated with LAFC held $19.4 million and $33.1 million, respectively, of deposits at the Bank.
Legal Fees and Other Matters. During July 2017, the Company and the Bank became aware that the former Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, Steven A. Sugarman, became of counsel to Michelman & Robinson, LLP, a law firm that previously provided legal services to the Bank. For legal services that were performed for the Bank over a period of more than four months, the Bank paid Michelman & Robinson, LLP approximately $330 thousand in fees during the three months ended March 31, 2017. No legal services were provided and $0 was paid to Michelman & Robinson, LLP from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Michelman & Robinson, LLP previously had three outstanding letters of credit with the Bank,which were issued under a line of credit that was originally extended to Michelman & Robinson, LLP prior to 2008. All three letters of credit were canceled in February 2018, and none were drawn upon as of December 31, 2017 or subsequent to that date. Michelman & Robinson, LLP elected to pay in full all outstanding borrowings under the line of credit in June 2017 and, thereafter, the line of credit was terminated. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Bank reimbursed Michelman & Robinson, LLP $100 thousand in connection with a matter concerning funds wired by a third party to a deposit account Michelman & Robinson, LLP held at the Bank.
Consulting Agreement for the Bank. On August 4, 2016, the Bank entered into a Management Services Agreement with Carlos Salas, who was, at the time, the Chief Executive Officer of COR Clearing LLC (COR Clearing) and Chief Financial Officer of COR Securities Holding, Inc. (CORSHI). Steven A. Sugarman, the then- (now former) Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, is believed by the Company to be the Chief Executive Officer, as well as a controlling equity owner, of both COR Clearing and CORSHI. For management consulting and advisory services provided to the Bank through the termination of the Management Services Agreement on November 30, 2016, Mr. Salas earned $108 thousand in fees. On December 1, 2016, Mr. Salas became a full-time employee of the Bank and tendered his resignation from his positions as Chief Executive Officer of COR Clearing and Chief Financial Officer of CORSHI effective upon the orderly transition of his duties, but in no case later than March 31, 2017. Mr. Salas earned $17 thousand as a full time employee of the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2016. Mr. Salas separated from the Bank on February 1, 2017.
CS Financial Acquisition. Effective October 31, 2013, the Company acquired CS Financial, which was controlled by Jeffrey T. Seabold and in which certain relatives of Steven A. Sugarman (the then- (now former) Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank) directly or through their affiliated entities also owned certain minority, non-controlling interests. Mr. Seabold previously served as Management Vice Chair of the Bank and also held prior positions as a director of the Company and the Bank; on September 5, 2017, Mr. Seabold submitted a notice of termination of employment as Management Vice Chair of the Bank pursuant to his employment agreement with the Bank effective immediately. The Company’s acquisition of CS Financial (the CS Financial Merger) was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the CS Financial Merger Agreement) with CS Financial, the stockholders of CS Financial (Sellers) and Mr. Seabold, as the Sellers’ Representative.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the CS Financial Merger Agreement, which was approved by the Board of Directors of each of the Company, the Bank and CS Financial, at the effective time of the CS Financial Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock of CS Financial were converted into the right to receive in the aggregate: (i) upon the closing of the CS Financial Merger, (a) 173,791 shares (Closing Date Shares) of voting common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, and (b) $1.5 million in cash and $3.2 million in the form of a noninterest-bearing note issued by the Company to Mr. Seabold that was due and paid by the Company on January 2, 2014; and (i) upon the achievement of certain performance targets by the Bank’s lending activities following the closing of the CS Financial Merger that are set forth in the CS Financial Merger Agreement, up to 92,781 shares (Performance Shares) of voting common stock ((i) and (ii), together, CS Financial Merger Consideration).
189

The Sellers under the CS Financial Merger Agreement included Mr. Seabold, and the following relatives of Steven A. Sugarman: Jason Sugarman (brother), Elizabeth Sugarman (sister-in-law), and Michael Sugarman (father), who each owned minority, non-controlling interests in CS Financial. Upon the closing of the CS Financial Merger and pursuant to the terms of the CS Financial Merger Agreement, the aggregate shares of voting common stock issued as the consideration to the Sellers was 173,791 shares, which was allocated by the Sellers and issued as follows: (i) 103,663 shares to Mr. Seabold; (ii) 16,140 shares to Jason Sugarman; (iii) 16,140 shares to Elizabeth Sugarman; (iv) 3,228 shares to Michael Sugarman; and (v) 34,620 shares to certain employees of CS Financial. Of the 103,663 shares to be issued to Mr. Seabold, as allowed under the CS Financial Merger Agreement and in consideration of repayment of a certain debt incurred by CS Financial owed to an entity controlled by Elizabeth Sugarman, Mr. Seabold requested the Company to issue all 103,663 shares directly to Elizabeth Sugarman, and such shares were so issued by the Company to Elizabeth Sugarman.
On October 31, 2014, certain of the Performance Shares were issued as follows: (i) 28,545 shares to Mr. Seabold; (ii) 1,082 shares to Jason Sugarman; (iii) 1,082 shares to Elizabeth Sugarman; and (iv) 216 shares to Michael Sugarman. An additional portion of the Performance Shares was issued on November 2, 2015 as follows: (i) 28,545 shares to Mr. Seabold; (ii) 1,082 shares to Jason Sugarman; (iii) 1,082 shares to Elizabeth Sugarman; and (iv) 216 shares to Michael Sugarman. The final tranche of the Performance Shares were issued on October 31, 2016 as follows: (i) 28,547 shares to Mr. Seabold; (ii) 1,083 shares to Jason Sugarman; (iii) 1,083 shares to Elizabeth Sugarman and (iv) 218 shares to Michael Sugarman.
All decisions and actions with respect to the CS Financial Merger Agreement and the CS Financial Merger (including without limitation the determination of the CS Financial Merger Consideration and the other material terms of the CS Financial Merger Agreement) were under the purview and authority of special committees of the Board of Directors of each of the Company and the Bank, each of which was composed exclusively of independent, disinterested directors of the Boards of Directors, with the assistance of outside financial and legal advisors. Mr. Sugarman abstained from the vote of each of the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank to approve the CS Financial Merger Agreement and the CS Financial Merger.
NOTE 27 – LITIGATION
From time to time we are involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. The Company continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. As of December 31, 2018, the Company accrued $781 thousand for various litigation filed against the Company and the Bank.
The Company was named as a defendant in several complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in January 2017 alleging violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaints were brought as purported class actions on behalf of stockholders who purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between varying dates, inclusive of August 7, 2015 through January 23, 2017. Those actions were consolidated, a lead plaintiff was appointed, and the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint on May 31, 2017. The defendants moved to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint. On September 18, 2017, the district court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ motions to dismiss. Specifically, the court denied the defendants’ motions as to the Company’s April 15, 2016 Proxy Statement which listed the positions held by Steven A. Sugarman (the Company’s then (now former) Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer) with COR Securities Holdings Inc., COR Clearing LLC, and COR Capital LLC while omitting their alleged connections with Jason Galanis. Trial is currently set for October 21, 2019. The Company believes that the action is without merit and intends to vigorously contest it.
On September 26, 2017, a shareholder derivative action captioned Gordon v. Sznewajs, Case No. 17-CV-1678, was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against four of the Company’s directors (Robert D. Sznewajs, Halle J. Benett, Jonah F. Schnel and now former director Jeffrey Karish) alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the Company. In that action, the Company is a nominal defendant. The complaint seeks monetary and equitable relief on behalf of the Company. The Company believes that the shareholder was required to, but failed to, make a demand on the Company to bring such claims, and that this failure requires dismissal of the action. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on those grounds. Rather than oppose the Company’s motion, plaintiff elected to file an amended complaint. The amended complaint was filed on February 6, 2018, which added Richard J. Lashley, Doug H. Bowers and John Grosvenor as individual defendants, and which added purported claims for gross negligence and unjust enrichment. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion was granted and the action was dismissed on June 22, 2018.
On September 5, 2017, Jeffrey T. Seabold, a former officer of the Company and the Bank, filed a complaint in the Los Angeles Superior Court against the Company and multiple unnamed defendants asserting claims for breach of contract, wrongful termination, retaliation and unfair business practices. Mr. Seabold alleges that he was constructively terminated as a Company 
190

and Bank employee and seeks in excess of $5 million in damages. On January 19, 2018, the parties reached a settlement in principle through mediation and a final settlement agreement was executed on February 14, 2018. The settlement did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
