Item 1.    Business
New Mountain Finance Corporation ("NMFC", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a Delaware corporation that was originally incorporated on June 29, 2010 and completed its initial public offering ("IPO") on May 19, 2011. We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). As such, we are obligated to comply with certain regulatory requirements. We have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Since our IPO, and through December 31, 2022, we have raised approximately $945.6 million in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock.
New Mountain Finance Advisers BDC, L.L.C. (the "Investment Adviser") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital Group, L.P. (together with New Mountain Capital L.L.C. and its affiliates, "New Mountain Capital"). New Mountain Capital is a firm with a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours. New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C. (the "Administrator”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.

We have established the following wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries:
•New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. ("NMF Holdings" or the "Predecessor Operating Company") and New Mountain Finance DB, L.L.C. ("NMFDB"), whose assets are used secure NMF Holdings’ credit facility and NMFDB’s credit facility, respectively;
•New Mountain Finance SBIC, L.P. ("SBIC I") and New Mountain Finance SBIC II, L.P. ("SBIC II"), who have received licenses from the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") to operate as small business investment companies ("SBICs") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the "1958 Act") and their general partners, New Mountain Finance SBIC G.P., L.L.C. ("SBIC I GP") and New Mountain Finance SBIC II G.P., L.L.C. ("SBIC II GP"), respectively;
•NMF Ancora Holdings, Inc. ("NMF Ancora"), NMF QID NGL Holdings, Inc. ("NMF QID"), NMF YP Holdings, Inc. ("NMF YP"), NMF Permian Holdings, LLC ("NMF Permian"), NMF HB, Inc.

("NMF OEC"), which serve as tax blocker corporations by holding equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies organized as limited liability companies (or other forms of pass-through entities); we consolidate our tax blocker corporations for accounting purposes but the tax blocker corporations are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may incur income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies; and
•New Mountain Finance Servicing, L.L.C. ("NMF Servicing"), which serves as the administrative agent on certain investment transactions.
New Mountain Net Lease Corporation ("NMNLC"), a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ours, which acquires commercial real estate properties that are subject to ‘‘triple net’’ leases, has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, within the meaning of Section 856(a) of the Code.
New Mountain Finance Advisers BDC, L.L.C.
The Investment Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital whose ultimate owners include Steven B. Klinsky, other current and former New Mountain Capital professionals and related vehicles and a minority investor. New Mountain Capital is a firm with a track record of investing in the middle market. New Mountain Capital focuses on investing in defensive growth companies across its private equity, credit and net lease investment strategies. The Investment Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services. In particular, the Investment Adviser is responsible for identifying attractive investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, structuring our investments and monitoring and servicing our investments. The Investment Adviser is managed by a six member investment committee (the "Investment Committee"), which is responsible for approving purchases and sales of our investments above $10.0 million in aggregate by issuer. For additional information on the Investment Committee, see "Investment Committee".
New Mountain Finance Administration, L.L.C.
The Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Mountain Capital, provides the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. The Administrator also maintains, or oversees the maintenance of, our consolidated financial records, our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Administrator performs the calculation and publication of our net asset values, the payment of our expenses and oversees the performance of various third-party service providers and the preparation and filing of our tax returns. The Administrator may also provide, on our behalf, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.
Competition
We compete for investments with a number of BDCs and investment funds (including private equity and hedge funds), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, the investment terms we offer, the model that we employ to perform our due diligence with the broader New Mountain Capital team and our model of investing in companies and industries we know well.
We believe that some of our competitors may make investments with interest rates and returns that are comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we target. Therefore, we do not seek to compete solely on the interest rates and returns that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investment Objective and Portfolio
Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation through the sourcing and origination of debt securities at all levels of the capital structure, including first and second lien debt, notes, bonds and mezzanine securities. The first lien debt may include traditional first lien senior secured loans or unitranche loans. Unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the “last out” tranche. We invest a significant portion of our portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt according to the combination of loan characteristics of the unitranche loan. Unitranche loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term and there is a heightened risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Certain unitranche loan investments may include “last-out” positions, which generally heighten the risk of loss. In some cases, our investments may also include equity interests.
We make investments through both primary originations and open-market secondary purchases. We primarily target loans to, and invest in, U.S. middle market businesses, a market segment we believe continues to be underserved by other lenders. We define middle market businesses as those businesses with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) between $10.0 million and $200.0 million. Our primary focus is in the debt of defensive growth companies, which are defined as generally exhibiting the following characteristics: (i) sustainable secular growth drivers, (ii) high barriers to competitive entry, (iii) high free cash flow after capital expenditure and working capital needs, (iv) high returns on assets and (v) niche market dominance. Similar to us, each of SBIC I's and SBIC II's investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation under our investment criteria. However, SBIC I’s and SBIC II's investments must be in SBA eligible small businesses. For additional information on SBA regulations, see "SBA Regulation". Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. As of December 31, 2022, our top five industry concentrations were software, business services, healthcare, investment funds (which includes our investments in our joint ventures) and education. Our targeted investments typically have maturities of between five and ten years and generally range in size between $10.0 million and $125.0 million. This investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes. At December 31, 2022, our portfolio consisted of 107 portfolio companies and was invested 54.5% in first lien loans, 17.4% in second lien loans, 2.4% in subordinated debt and 25.7% in equity and other, as measured at fair value versus 106 portfolio companies invested 52.2% in first lien loans, 19.8% in second lien loans, 1.6% in subordinated debt and 26.4% in equity and other, as measured at fair value at December 31, 2021.
The fair value of our investments, as determined in good faith by the board of directors, was approximately $3,221.2 million in 107 portfolio companies at December 31, 2022 and approximately $3,174.4 million in 106 portfolio companies at December 31, 2021. 
The following table shows our portfolio and investment activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:
 | Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) | 2022 | | 2021 | 
New investments in 50 and 62 portfolio companies, respectively | $ | 620.7 | | | $ | 1,134.9
Debt repayments in existing portfolio companies | 395.1 | | | 857.8 | | 
Sales of securities in 9 and 13 portfolio companies, respectively | 188.8 | | | 208.9 | | 
Change in unrealized appreciation on 21 and 36 portfolio companies, respectively | 81.3 | | | 136.7 | | 
Change in unrealized depreciation on 92 and 92 portfolio companies, respectively | (165.4) | | | (44.3) | | 

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our weighted average yield to maturity at cost ("YTM at Cost") was approximately 11.3% and 9.1%, respectively. This YTM at Cost calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, not on non-accrual are purchased at cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our weighted average yield to maturity at cost for investments ("YTM at Cost for Investments") was approximately 10.0% and 8.4%, respectively. This YTM at Cost for Investments calculation assumes that all investments, including secured collateralized agreements, are purchased at cost on the quarter end date and held until their respective maturities with no prepayments or losses and exited at par at maturity. YTM at Cost and YTM at Cost for Investments calculations exclude the impact of existing leverage. YTM at Cost and YTM at Cost for Investments use the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate ("SONIA"), Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") curves at each quarter's end date. The actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower due to the future selection of the LIBOR, SONIA, SOFR and EURIBOR contracts by the individual companies in our portfolio or other factors.
The following summarizes our ten largest portfolio company investments and the top ten industries in which we were invested as of December 31, 2022, calculated as a percentage of total assets as of December 31, 2022:

Investment Criteria
The Investment Adviser has identified the following investment criteria and guidelines for use in evaluating prospective portfolio companies. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines were, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments.
•Defensive growth industries.  We seek to invest in industries that can succeed in both robust and weak economic environments but which are also sufficiently large and growing to achieve high valuations providing enterprise value cushion for our targeted debt securities.
•High barriers to competitive entry.  We target industries and companies that have well defined industries and well established, understandable barriers to competitive entry.
•Recurring revenue.  Where possible, we focus on companies that have a high degree of predictability in future revenue.
•Flexible cost structure.  We seek to invest in businesses that have limited fixed costs and therefore modest operating leverage.
•Strong free cash flow and high return on assets.  We focus on businesses with a demonstrated ability to produce meaningful free cash flow from operations. We typically target companies that are not asset intensive and that have minimal capital expenditure and minimal working capital growth needs.
•Sustainable business and niche market dominance.  We seek to invest in businesses that exert niche market dominance in their industry and that have a demonstrated history of sustaining market leadership over time.
•Established companies.  We seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans.
•Private equity sponsorship.  We generally seek to invest in companies in conjunction with private equity sponsors who we know and trust and who have proven capabilities in building value.
•Seasoned management team.  We generally require that portfolio companies have a seasoned management team with strong corporate governance. Oftentimes we have a historical relationship with or direct knowledge of key managers from previous investment experience.
Investment Selection and Process
The Investment Adviser believes it has developed a proven, consistent and replicable investment process to execute our investment strategy. The Investment Adviser seeks to identify the most attractive investment sectors from the top down and then works to become the most advantaged investor in these sectors. The steps in the Investment Adviser's process include:
•Identifying attractive investment sectors from the top down;
•Creating competitive advantages in the selected industry sectors; and
•Targeting companies with leading market share and attractive business models in its chosen sectors.
Investment Committee
The Investment Adviser is managed by a six member Investment Committee, which is responsible for approving purchases and sales of our investments above $10.0 million in aggregate by issuer. The Investment Committee currently consists of Steven B. Klinsky, Robert A. Hamwee, Adam B. Weinstein, Laura C. Holson and John R. Kline. The sixth and final member of the Investment Committee will consist of a New Mountain Capital Managing Director who will hold the position on the Investment Committee on an annual rotating basis. Kyle Peterson served on the Investment Committee from August 2021 to July 2022. Beginning in August 2022, A. Joe Delgado was appointed to the Investment Committee for a one year term. Effective January 1, 2023, Laura C. Holson joined the Investment Committee as a new permanent member. In addition, our executive officers and certain investment professionals of the Investment Adviser are invited to all Investment Committee meetings. Purchases and dispositions below $10.0 million may be approved by our chief executive officer. These approval thresholds are subject to change over time. We expect to benefit from the extensive and varied relevant experience of the investment professionals serving on the Investment Committee, which includes expertise in private equity, primary and secondary leveraged credit, private mezzanine finance and distressed debt.
The purpose of the Investment Committee is to evaluate and approve, as deemed appropriate, all investments by the Investment Adviser, subject to certain thresholds. The Investment Committee's process is intended to bring the diverse 
experience and perspectives of the Investment Committee's members to the analysis and consideration of every investment. The Investment Committee also serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to the Investment Adviser's investment philosophies and policies. The Investment Committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements.
In addition to reviewing investments, the Investment Committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and investment opportunities are also reviewed on a regular basis. Members of our investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credit with the Investment Committee early in their analysis. This process improves the quality of the analysis and allows the deal team members to work more efficiently.
Investment Structure
We target debt investments that will yield current income and occasionally provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through equity securities. Our debt investments are typically structured with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target.
Debt Investments
The terms of our debt investments are tailored to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and prospective portfolio company and structured to protect its rights and manage its risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. A substantial source of return is the cash interest that we collect on our debt investments.
•First Lien Loans and Bonds.  First lien loans and bonds generally have terms of four to seven years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, may contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our first lien loans may also include unitranche loans. Unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the “last out” tranche. We invest a significant portion of our portfolio in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first-lien position. Because unitranche loans combine characteristics of senior and subordinated debt, they have risks similar to the risks associated with secured debt and subordinated debt according to the combination of loan characteristics of the unitranche loan. Unitranche loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term and there is a heightened risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity.These first lien loans and bonds may include payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal that generally becomes due at maturity.
•Second Lien Loans and Bonds.  Second lien loans and bonds generally have terms of five to eight years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, may contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a second priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. These second lien loans and bonds may include PIK interest.
•Unsecured Senior, Subordinated and "Mezzanine" Loans and Bonds.  Any unsecured investments are generally expected to have terms of five to ten years and provide for a fixed interest rate. Unsecured investments may include PIK interest and may have an equity component, such as warrants to purchase common stock in the portfolio company.
In addition, from time to time we may also enter into revolving credit facilities, bridge financing commitments, delayed draw commitments or other commitments which can result in providing future financing to a portfolio company.
Equity Investments
When we make a debt investment, we may be granted equity in the portfolio company in the same class of security as the sponsor receives upon funding. In addition, we may from time to time make non-control, passive equity co-investments in conjunction with private equity sponsors. We generally seek to structure our passive equity investments, such as direct equity co-investments, to provide us with minority rights provisions and event-driven put rights. We also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include “piggyback” registration rights.
Portfolio Company Monitoring
We monitor the performance and financial trends of our portfolio companies on at least a quarterly basis. We attempt to identify any developments within the portfolio company, the industry or the macroeconomic environment that may alter any material element of our original investment strategy. We have recently consolidated our portfolio monitoring procedures by combining our previously bifurcated system that separately (1) rated investments based on their performance compared to expectations and (2) assigned a risk rating to each investment based on the expected impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. As described more fully below, our new portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive analysis of our portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating (as defined below).
We use an investment risk rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in the portfolio. As such, we assign each investment a composite score (“Risk Rating”) based on two metrics – 1) Operating Performance and 2) Business Characteristics:
•Operating Performance assesses the health of the investment in context of its financial performance and the market environment it faces. The metric is expressed in Tiers of “1” to “4”, with “1” being the worst and “4” being the best:
◦Tier 1 – Severe business underperformance and/or severe market headwinds
◦Tier 2 – Significant business underperformance and/or significant market headwinds
◦Tier 3 – Moderate business underperformance and/or moderate market headwinds
◦Tier 4 – Business performance is in-line with or above expectations
•Business Characteristics assesses the health of the investment in context of the underlying portfolio company’s business and credit quality, the underlying portfolio company’s current balance sheet, and the level of support from the equity sponsor. The metric is expressed as on a qualitative scale of “A” to “C”, with “A” being the best and “C” being the worst.
The Risk Rating for each investment is a composite of these two metrics. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Red, Orange, Yellow and Green, with Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations and Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations. The mapping of the composite scores to these categories are below:
•Red – 1C (e.g., Tier 1 for Operating Performance and C for Business Characteristics)
•Orange – 2C and 1B
•Yellow – 3C, 2B, and 1A
•Green – 4C, 3B, 2A, 4B, 3A, and 4A
The following table shows the Risk Rating of our portfolio companies as of December 31, 2022:

(in millions) | As of December 31, 2022
Risk Rating | | Cost | | Percent | | Fair Value | | Percent
Red | | $ | 72.0 | | | 2.2 | % | | $ | 24.3 | | | 0.7 | %
Orange | | 66.5 | | | 2.0 | % | | 42.7 | | | 1.3 | %
Yellow | | 216.0 | | | 6.6 | % | | 184.0 | | | 5.8 | %
Green | | 2,935.5 | | | 89.2 | % | | 2,986.8 | | | 92.2 | %
 | | $ | 3,290.0 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 3,237.8 | | | 100.0 | %

Exit Strategies/Refinancing
We exit our investments typically through one of four scenarios: (i) the sale of the portfolio company itself, resulting in repayment of all outstanding debt, (ii) the recapitalization of the portfolio company in which our loan is replaced with debt or equity from a third party or parties (in some cases, we may choose to participate in the newly issued loan(s)), (iii) the repayment of the initial or remaining principal amount of our loan then outstanding at maturity, or (iv) the sale of the debt investment by us. In some investments, there may be scheduled amortization of some portion of our loan which would result in a partial exit of our investment prior to the maturity of the loan.
Valuation
At all times, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the 1940 Act, we conduct a valuation of our assets, which impacts our net asset value.
We value our assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. In all cases, our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available and any other situation where our portfolio investments require a fair value determination. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Our quarterly valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:
(1)Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services.
(2)Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP.
a.Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and if so, the quote is used. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and
b.For investments other than bonds, the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following:
i.Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. We will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, we will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value;
ii.Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated internally. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. If the Investment Adviser is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below).
(3)Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process:
a.Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the credit monitoring;
b.Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management;
c.If an investment falls into (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment's par value or its fair value exceeds the materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors; and
d.When deemed appropriate by our management, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to review and value investment(s) of a portfolio company, without any preliminary valuation being performed by the Investment Adviser. The investment professionals of the Investment Adviser will review and validate the value provided.
For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of commitments not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded.
The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material.
Operating and Regulatory Environment
As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain regulatory requirements. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to investments by a BDC in another investment company, as well as transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. A BDC must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States, it must be operated for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private or thinly traded companies and it must make significant managerial assistance available to those companies whose securities are considered Qualifying Assets (as defined below) for the BDC. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
We have a board of directors. A majority of our board of directors must be persons who are not "interested persons", as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the "independent directors"). As a BDC, we are prohibited from indemnifying any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office. Additionally, to provide additional shareholder protection we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC.
As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings, excluding SBA-guaranteed debentures, and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 150.0% (which means we can borrow $2 for every $1 of our equity). We monitor our compliance with this coverage ratio on a regular basis.
We may, to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, issue additional equity or debt capital. We will generally not be able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share without shareholder approval. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
As a BDC, we will not generally be permitted to invest in any portfolio company in which the Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates currently have an investment or to make any co-investments with the Investment Adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC. On October 8, 2019, the SEC issued an exemptive order (the “Exemptive Order”), which superseded a prior order issued on December 18, 2017, which permits us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Exemptive Order. Pursuant to the Exemptive Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Exemptive Order was amended on August 30, 2022 to permit us to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company, subject to certain conditions.
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67.0% or more of such company's voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50.0% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50.0% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
In addition, as a BDC, we are not permitted to issue stock in consideration for services.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
We have elected to be treated, and intend to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as distributions. Rather, distributions paid by us generally will be taxable to our stockholders, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes of ours generally will not pass through to our stockholders, subject to special rules for certain items such as net capital gains and qualified dividend income recognized by us.
To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must timely distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90.0% of our "investment company taxable income", which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the "Annual Distribution Requirement").
We will be subject to a 4.0% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98.0% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and capital gain net income that we recognized for the preceding years, but were not distributed during such years, and on which we did not pay U.S. federal income tax (the "Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement"). While we intend to make distributions to our stockholders in each taxable year that will be sufficient to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entirely avoiding this tax.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90.0% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships", or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the "90.0% Income Test"); and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
•at least 50.0% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5.0% of the value of our assets or more than 10.0% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
•no more than 25.0% of the value of our assets is invested in (1) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (2) the securities, other than securities of other RICs, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades, or (3) the securities of certain "qualified publicly traded partnerships" (the "Diversification Tests").
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its "investment company taxable income" (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed our investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years and such net operating losses do not pass through to its stockholders. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. A RIC may not use any net capital losses (that is, realized capital losses in excess of realized capital gains) to offset the RIC's investment company taxable income, but may carry forward such losses, and use them to offset capital gains, indefinitely. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses and net capital losses, we may for U.S. federal income tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years.
Failure to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company
If we fail to satisfy the 90.0% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year or quarter of such taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions of the Code apply (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates or to dispose of certain assets). If we fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC and such relief provisions do not apply to us, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates (and also will be subject to any applicable state and local taxes), regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required. However, if distributions were made, any such distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income and, subject to certain limitations under the Code, may qualify as "qualified dividends" that are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 20.0%. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.
Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized during the five-year period after our requalification as a RIC, unless we made a special election to pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC. We may decide to be taxed as a regular corporation even if we would otherwise qualify as a RIC if we determine that treatment as a corporation for a particular year would be in our best interests.
SBA Regulation
On August 1, 2014 and August 25, 2017, SBIC I and SBIC II, our wholly owned subsidiaries, received licenses from the SBA to operate as SBICs under Section 301(c) of the 1958 Act, respectively. SBIC I and SBIC II have an investment strategy and philosophy substantially similar to ours and make similar types of investments in accordance with SBA regulations.
An SBIC license allows each of SBIC I and SBIC II to incur leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment and other customary procedures. SBA-guaranteed debentures carry long-term fixed rates that are generally lower than rates on comparable bank and other debt. In June 2018, the limit of SBA leverage available to an individual SBIC eligible for two tiers of leverage was increased from $150.0 million with at least $75.0 million in regulatory capital to $175.0 million with at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital, subject to SBA approval. The maximum leverage available to a group of SBICs under common control is $350.0 million. Currently, SBIC I and SBIC II operate under the prior $150.0 million leverage limit. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, have a maturity of ten years, require semi-annual payments of interest and do not require any principal payments prior to maturity. SBIC I and SBIC II are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to reporting financial information, such as the extent of capital impairment, if applicable, on a regular basis. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to SBIC I's and SBIC II's assets over our stockholders in the event SBIC I and SBIC II are liquidated or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by SBIC I and SBIC II upon an event of default.
On November 5, 2014, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the SBA-guaranteed debentures of SBIC I, SBIC II and any other future SBIC subsidiaries from our 150.0% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. As such, our ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150.0%. This provides us with increased investment flexibility but also increases our risks related to leverage.
SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private investor capital to eligible "small businesses" as defined by the SBA. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. Under present SBA regulations, eligible small businesses generally include businesses that (together with their affiliates) have a tangible net worth not exceeding $24.0 million and have average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $8.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must invest 25.0% of its investment capital to "smaller enterprises", as defined by the SBA. The definition of a smaller enterprise generally includes businesses that (together with their affiliates) have a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million for the most recent fiscal year and have average net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $2.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any net carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative industry size standard criteria to determine eligibility for designation as an eligible small business or smaller enterprise, which criteria depend on the primary industry in which the business is engaged and is based on the number of employees or gross revenue of the business and its affiliates. However, once an SBIC has invested in an eligible small business, 
it may continue to make follow-on investments in the company, regardless of the size of the company at the time of the follow-on investment, up to the time of the company's initial public offering, if any.
The SBA generally prohibits an SBIC from providing financing to small businesses with certain characteristics, such as relending businesses or businesses with the majority of their employees located outside the United States, and businesses engaged in certain prohibited industries, such as project finance, real estate, farmland, financial intermediaries or "passive" (i.e. non-operating) businesses. Without prior SBA approval, an SBIC may not provide financing or a commitment to a small business in an amount equal to more than approximately 30.0% of the SBIC's regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates.
The SBA places certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies (such as limiting the permissible interest rate on debt securities held by an SBIC in a portfolio company). An SBIC may exercise control over a small business for a period of up to seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBA's prior written approval.
The SBA restricts the ability of an SBIC to provide financing to an "associate" as defined in the SBA regulations, without prior written approval from the SBA. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a "change of control" of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10.0% or more of a class of capital stock of a licensed SBIC. A "change of control" is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise.
The SBA regulations require, among other things, a periodic examination of a licensed SBIC by an SBA examiner to determine the SBIC's compliance with the relevant SBA regulations, and the performance of a financial audit by an independent auditor.
Summary Risk Factors
The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.
Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure
•We are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. 
•Adverse developments in the credit markets may impair our ability to secure debt financing. 
•Events outside of our control, including public health crises, could negatively affect our portfolio companies and our results of our operations. 
•We may suffer credit losses.
•There is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments because most of our investments are, and may continue to be in private companies and recorded at fair value. In addition, the fair values of our investments are determined by our board of directors in accordance with our valuation policy.
•Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on key investment personnel of the Investment Adviser. If the Investment Adviser were to lose any of its key investment personnel, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.
•The 1940 Act and the Code impose numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs and RICs, which could adversely affect our business.
•We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and may not be able to compete effectively.
•Our business, results of operations and financial condition depend on our ability to manage future growth effectively.
•The management fee and incentive fee may induce the Investment Adviser to make speculative investments.
•We may be obligated to pay the Investment Adviser incentive compensation even if we incur a loss.
•The incentive fee we pay to the Investment Adviser with respect to capital gains may be effectively greater than 20.0%.
•We borrow money, which could magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us and increase the risk of investing in us.
•If we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions in our borrowings, our business could be materially adversely affected.
•The terms of our credit facilities may contractually limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
•If we are unable to obtain additional debt financing, or if our borrowing capacity is materially reduced, our business could be materially adversely affected.
•A renewed disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could adversely affect our business.
•SBIC I and SBIC II are licensed by the SBA and are subject to SBA regulations.
Risks Related to Our Operations
•Because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders to maintain our status as a RIC, we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth. If additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms, our ability to grow may be impaired. 
•SBIC I and SBIC II may be unable to make distributions to us that will enable us to meet or maintain our RIC tax treatment.
•Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.
•The Investment Adviser has significant potential conflicts of interest with us and, consequently, your interests as stockholders which could adversely impact our investment returns.
•The valuation process for certain of our portfolio holdings creates a conflict of interest.
•Conflicts of interest may exist related to other arrangements with the Investment Adviser or its affiliates.
•The Investment Management Agreement with the Investment Adviser and the Administration Agreement with the Administrator were not negotiated on an arm’s length basis.
•The Investment Adviser’s liability is limited under the Investment Management Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify the Investment Adviser against certain liabilities, which may lead the Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner than it would when acting for its own account.
•If we fail to maintain our status as a BDC, our business and operating flexibility could be significantly reduced.
•If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could be precluded from investing in certain assets or could be required to dispose of certain assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•Regulations governing the operations of BDCs will affect our ability to raise additional equity capital as well as our ability to issue senior securities or borrow for investment purposes, any or all of which could have a negative effect on our investment objectives and strategies.
•Our business model in the future may depend to an extent upon our referral relationships with private equity sponsors, and the inability of the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business strategy.
•Our board of directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse to your interests as stockholders.
•We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on all of our income if we are unable to maintain tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
•You may have current tax liabilities on distributions you reinvest in our common stock.
•We may not be able to pay you distributions on our common stock, our distributions to you may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions to you may be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income.
•The Small Business Credit Availability Act allows us to incur additional leverage, which could increase the risk of investing in our securities.
•Internal and external cyber threats, as well as other disasters, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.
Risks Relating to Our Investments
•Our investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or part of any of our investments.
•Our investment strategy, which is focused primarily on privately held companies, presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies.
•Our investments in securities rated below investment grade are speculative in nature and are subject to additional risk factors such as increased possibility of default, illiquidity of the security, and changes in value based on changes in interest rates.
•Our portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries, which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if there is a downturn in a particular industry in which a number of our investments are concentrated.
•Defaults by our portfolio companies may harm our operating results.
•The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
•If we are unable to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies, the value of our investment portfolio could be adversely affected.
•Second priority liens on collateral securing loans that we make to our portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us.
•A number of our portfolio companies provide services to the U.S. government. Changes in the U.S. government’s priorities and spending, or significant delays or reductions in appropriations of the U.S. government’s funds, could have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of such portfolio companies.
•Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.
•We may not realize gains from our equity investments.
•Our performance may differ from our historical performance as our current investment strategy includes significantly more primary originations in addition to secondary market purchases.
•Changes relating to the LIBOR calculation process may adversely affect the value of our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities. 
Risks Relating to Our Securities
•Investing in our common stock may involve an above average degree of risk.
•Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
•Shares of our common stock have traded at a discount from net asset value and may do so in the future.
•You may not receive distributions or our distributions may decline or may not grow over time.
Investment Management Agreement
We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We are externally managed by our Investment Adviser and pay our Investment Adviser a fee for its services. The following summarizes our arrangements with the Investment Adviser pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement").
Management Services
The Investment Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). The Investment Adviser serves pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, the Investment Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Adviser:
•determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
•determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell;
•identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of our investments that we make;
•executes, monitors and services the investments that we make;
•performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;
•votes, exercises consents and exercises all other rights appertaining to such securities and other assets on our behalf; and
•provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require.
The Investment Adviser's services under the Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and the Investment Adviser (so long as its services to us are not impaired) and/or other entities affiliated with New Mountain Capital are permitted to furnish similar services to other entities. The Investment Adviser also manages other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours.
Management Fees
Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Investment Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components—a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to the Investment Adviser and any incentive fees paid in cash to the Investment Adviser are borne by us and, as a result, are indirectly borne by our common stockholders.
Base Management Fees
Pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the Investment Management Agreement dated November 1, 2021 ("Amendment No. 1"), the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.4% of the Company's gross assets, which equals the Company's total assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Prior to Amendment No. 1, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of the Company's gross assets, which equaled the Company's total assets on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, less (i) the borrowings under the New Mountain Finance SPV Funding, L.L.C. Loan and Security Agreement, as amended and restated, dated October 27, 2010 (the "SLF Credit Facility") and (ii) cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of the Company's gross assets, which equals the Company's total assets, as determined in accordance with GAAP, less cash and cash equivalents at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted on a pro rata basis for any equity capital raises or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. The Company has not invested, and currently is not invested, in derivatives. To the extent the Company invests in derivatives in the future, the Company will use the actual value of the derivatives, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities, for purposes of calculating its base management fee.
Effective as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 through the quarter ending December 31, 2023, the Investment Adviser has entered into a fee waiver agreement (the "Fee Waiver Agreement") pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will waive base management fees in order to reach a target base management fee of 1.25% on gross assets (the “Reduced Base Management Fee”). The Investment Adviser cannot recoup management fees that the Investment Adviser has previously waived. For the year ended December 31, 2022, total management fees waived was approximately $4.4 million.
Incentive Fees
The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals 20.0% of our "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" for the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a "preferred return", or "hurdle", and a "catch-up" feature. "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, upfront, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement, as amended and restated (the "Administration Agreement"), with the Administrator, and any interest expense and distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock (of which there is none as of December 31, 2022), but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, will be compared to a "hurdle rate" of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized), subject to a "catch-up" provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. The hurdle rate is appropriately pro-rated for any partial periods. The calculation of our incentive fee with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows:
•No incentive fee is payable to the Investment Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.0% (the "preferred return" or "hurdle").
•100.0% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser. This portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than or equal to 2.5%) is referred to as the "catch-up". The catch-up provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 20.0% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter.
•20.0% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to the Investment Adviser once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, no incentive fees were waived. The Investment Adviser cannot recoup incentive fees that the Investment Adviser has previously waived.
The second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement) and will equal 20.0% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee.
In accordance with GAAP, we accrue a hypothetical capital gains incentive fee based upon the cumulative net realized capital gains and realized capital losses and the cumulative net unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. Actual amounts paid to the Investment Adviser are consistent with the Investment Management Agreement and are based only on actual realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year as if the entire portfolio was sold at fair value.
Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee for Each Calendar Quarter:
Alternative 1
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.00%
Management fee(2) = 0.35%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, safekeeping agent, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.70%
    Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no income related incentive fee.
Alternative 2
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.90%
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.00%
Management fee(2) = 0.35%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, safekeeping agent, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.35%
Incentive fee = 100.00% × Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to "catch-up")(4)
= 100.00% × (2.35% – 2.00%)
= 0.35%
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the "catch-up" provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.35%.
Alternative 3
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% 
Hurdle rate(1) = 2.00%
Management fee(2) = 0.35%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, safekeeping agent, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20%
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
(investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.95%
Incentive fee = 100.00% × Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (subject to "catch-up")(4)
Incentive fee = 100.00% × "catch-up" + (20.00% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 2.50%))
Catch-up = 2.50% – 2.00%
                = 0.50%
Incentive fee = (100.00% × 0.50%) + (20.00% × (2.95% – 2.50%))
                      = 0.50% + (20.00% × 0.45%)
                      = 0.50% + 0.09%
                      = 0.59%
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the "catch-up" provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.59%
.(1)Represents 8.00% annualized hurdle rate.
(2)Assumes 1.4% annualized base management fee.
(3)Excludes organizational and offering expenses.
(4)The "catch-up" provision is intended to provide the Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 20.00% on all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 2.50% in any calendar quarter.
Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:
Alternative 1:
Assumptions
Year 1: $20.0 million investment made in Company A ("Investment A"), and $30.0 million investment made in Company B ("Investment B")
Year 2: Investment A sold for $50.0 million and fair market value ("FMV") of Investment B determined to be $32.0 million
Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million
Year 4: Investment B sold for $31.0 million
The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
Year 1: None
Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6.0 million—($30.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)
Year 3: None—$5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30.0 million cumulative capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6.0 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2)
Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $0.2 million—$6.2 million ($31.0 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $6.0 million (capital gains incentive fee taken in Year 2)
Alternative 2
Assumptions
Year 1: $20.0 million investment made in Company A ("Investment A"), $30.0 million investment made in Company B ("Investment B") and $25.0 million investment made in Company C ("Investment C")
Year 2: Investment A sold for $50.0 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25.0 million
Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27.0 million and Investment C sold for $30.0 million
Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35.0 million
Year 5: Investment B sold for $20.0 million
The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be:
Year 1: None
Year 2: $5.0 million capital gains incentive fee—20.0% multiplied by $25.0 million ($30.0 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5.0 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)
Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee—$6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32.0 million ($35.0 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3.0 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5.0 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2
Year 4: $0.6 million capital gains incentive fee—$7.0 million (20.0% multiplied by $35.0 million cumulative realized capital gains) less cumulative $6.4 million capital gains incentive fee received in Year 2 and Year 3
Year 5: None—$5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by $25.0 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35.0 million less realized capital losses of $10.0 million)) less $7.0 million cumulative capital gains incentive fee paid in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4(1)
(1)As noted above, it is possible that the cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by the Investment Adviser ($7.0 million) is effectively greater than $5.0 million (20.0% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses or net unrealized depreciation ($25.0 million)).

Board Consideration of the Investment Management Agreement 
Our board of directors initially approved our Investment Management Agreement between the Company and the Adviser on March 25, 2014. Thereafter, our stockholders approved the Investment Management Agreement on May 6, 2014. The Investment Management Agreement first became effective on May 8, 2014. Our board of directors determined at a virtual meeting held on November 1, 2021 to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Investment Management Agreement, the sole purpose of which was to reduce the base management fee. On January 24, 2023, our board of directors held a board meeting to consider the re-approval of our Investment Management Agreement. In its consideration of the re-approval of the Investment Management Agreement, our board of directors focused on information they had received relating to, among other things:
•the nature, extent and quality of advisory and other services provided by the Investment Adviser, including information about our investment performance relative to our stated objectives and in comparison to our 
performance peer group and relevant market indices, and concluded that such advisory and other services are satisfactory and our investment performance is reasonable;
•the experience and qualifications of the personnel providing such advisory and other services, including information about the backgrounds of the investment personnel, the allocation of responsibilities among such personnel and the process by which investment decisions are made, and concluded that the investment personnel of the Investment Adviser have extensive experience and are well qualified to provide advisory and other services to us;
•the current fee structure, the existence of any fee waivers, and our anticipated expense ratios in relation to those of other investment companies having comparable investment policies and limitations, and concluded that the current fee structure is reasonable;
•the advisory fees charged to us by the Investment Adviser and comparative data regarding the advisory fees charged by other investment advisers to BDCs with similar investment objectives, and concluded that the advisory fees charged to us by the Investment Adviser are reasonable;
•the direct and indirect costs, including for personnel and office facilities, that are incurred by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates in performing services for us and the basis of determining and allocating these costs, and concluded that the direct and indirect costs, including the allocation of such costs, are reasonable;
•the total of all assets managed by the Adviser, as well as total number of investment companies and other clients serviced by the Adviser and possible economies of scale arising from our size and/or anticipated growth, and the extent to which such economies of scale are reflected in the advisory fees charged to us by the Investment Adviser, and concluded that some economies of scale may be possible in the future;
•other possible benefits to the Investment Adviser and its affiliates arising from their relationships with us, and concluded that any such other benefits were not material to the Investment Adviser and its affiliates; and
•possible alternative fee structures or bases for determining fees and the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third party service providers, and concluded that our current fee structure and bases for determining fees are satisfactory.
Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, our board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors, concluded that the fees payable to the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement were reasonable, and comparable to the fees paid by other management investment companies with similar investment objectives, in relation to the services to be provided. As a result, our board of directors re-approved the Investment Management Agreement for a period of 12 months commencing on March 1, 2023, Our board of directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. Individual members of our board of directors may have given different weights to different factors.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as "qualifying assets", unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70.0% of the BDC's total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an "eligible portfolio company", or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is not an investment company (other than an SBIC wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c)satisfies any of the following:
(i)does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii)has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250.0 million;
(iii)is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
(iv)is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.
2)Securities of any eligible portfolio company that the BDC controls.
3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
4)Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the BDC already owns 60.0% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
As of December 31, 2022, 16.7% of our total assets were non-qualifying assets.
Significant Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
BDCs generally must offer to make available to the eligible issuers of its securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Administrator or its affiliate provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that accept our offer of managerial assistance.
Temporary Investments
Pending investments in other types of qualifying assets, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment (collectively, as “temporary investments”), so that 70.0% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. We had no temporary investments as of December 31, 2022.
Repurchase Agreements
A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25.0% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. The Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. We had no repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2022.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150.0% immediately after each such issuance (which means we can borrow $2 for every $1 of our equity). If our asset ratio coverage is not at least 150.0%, we would be unable to issue additional senior securities, and certain provisions of our senior securities may preclude us from making distributions to our stockholders. However, at December 31, 
2022, none of our senior securities have provisions that may preclude us from making distributions to stockholders. We may also borrow amounts up to 5.0% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to our asset coverage. We will include our assets and liabilities and all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries for purposes of calculating the asset coverage ratio. We received exemptive relief from the SEC on November 5, 2014, allowing us to modify the asset coverage requirement to exclude SBA-guaranteed debentures from this calculation. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The code of ethics is available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and the Investment Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for the adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our chief compliance officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Investment Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of the Investment Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Investment Adviser and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, the Investment Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote proxies relating to our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests.
The policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of the Investment Adviser are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy policies
The Investment Adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in our best interest. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although the Investment Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
The proxy voting decisions of the Investment Adviser are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how the Investment Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Proxy voting records
You may obtain, without charge, information regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, 1633 Broadway, 48th Floor, New York, New York 10019.
Staffing
We do not have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Investment Adviser. See “—Investment Management Agreement”. We reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations to us under the Administration Agreement, including the compensation of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer, and their respective staffs. For a more detailed discussion of the 
Administration Agreement, see Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5. Agreements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding their assessment of their internal control over financial reporting and is required to obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
•pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports are required to disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We intend to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
