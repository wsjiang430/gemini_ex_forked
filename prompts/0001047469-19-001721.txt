  Overview 
         We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of targeted immunotherapy using fully human monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, to treat life-threatening infections. mAbs represent a fundamentally new treatment approach in the infectious disease market and are designed to overcome key issues associated with current therapies, including drug resistance, short duration of response, negative impact on the human microbiome, and lack of differentiation between treatment alternatives. Our proprietary product pipeline is comprised of fully human mAbs targeting specific pathogens associated with life-threatening bacterial infections, primarily hospital-acquired pneumonia, or HAP, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, or VAP. Three of our product candidates have exhibited promising preclinical data and clinical data are available from two completed studies and are in pivotal trial stage. Our lead product candidate, AR-301, targets the alpha toxin produced by gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, or  S. aureus, a common pathogen associated with HAP and VAP. In contrast to other programs targeting S. aureus toxins, we are developing AR-301 as a treatment of pneumonia, rather than prevention of S. aureus colonized patients from progression to pneumonia. We have conducted an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and initiated a Phase 3 pivotal trial for AR-301 in January 2019. In addition, we are developing AR-105 and AR-101. AR-105 targets gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or P. aeruginosa, and has been granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA. We initiated a global Phase 2 trial for AR-105 in HAP and VAP patients in the second quarter of 2017. We expect to report top-line results of the AR-105 Phase 2 trial in the third quarter of 2019. AR-101 also targets gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa and has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and EU. We plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 pivotal trial for AR-101 in the second half of 2019. 
         The majority of candidates from our product pipeline are derived by employing our differentiated antibody discovery platform called MabIgX. This platform is designed to comprehensively screen the B-cell repertoire and isolate human antibody-producing B-cells from individuals who have either successfully overcome an infection by a particular pathogen or have been vaccinated against a particular pathogen. We believe that B-cells from these patients are the ideal source of highly protective and efficacious mAbs which can been administered safely to other patients. MabIgX also allows for rapid, high-throughput screening of B-cells and direct manufacturing of mAbs. As a result, we can significantly reduce time for antibody discovery and manufacturing compared to conventional approaches. 
         Our initial clinical indication is for adjunctive therapeutic treatment with standard of care, or SOC, antibiotics for HAP and VAP. Mortality and morbidity associated with HAP and VAP in the intensive care units, or ICU, remain high despite aggressive treatment with SOC antibiotics. Current SOC antibiotics used to treat HAP and VAP typically involve a combination of several broad spectrum antibiotics that are prescribed empirically at the start of treatment. The specific empirical antibiotic regimens that are prescribed vary widely among physicians, and generally resulted in modest clinical benefits due to a number of reasons, including the frequent mismatch of the antibiotics regimen to the etiologic agent and/or infection by an antibiotic resistant strain. Recently, rapid diagnostic tests have been introduced that allow the identification of infection-causing agents within hours. These increasingly common tests allow physicians to prescribe a targeted anti-infective drug, rather than a broad-spectrum antibiotic. This evidenced-based treatment approach is designed to remove issues associated with SOC antibiotics treatment practices, and to improve the effectiveness of SOC 
 5

   antibiotics, while not competing directly with antibiotics. In contrast to the lack of differentiation among SOC antibiotics, mAbs are highly differentiated from SOC antibiotics in mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic profile, and thus are well suited to complement antibiotics action and are effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria. To emphasize the benefits of our product candidates as an adjunctive therapy, we design clinical trials based on superiority endpoints. 
         HAP and VAP pose serious challenges in the hospital setting, as SOC antibiotics are becoming inadequate in treating infected patients. There are approximately 3,000,000 cases of pneumonia reported in the U.S. per year and approximately 628,000 annual cases of HAP and VAP caused by Gram negative bacteria and MRSA (DRG, 2016). These patients are typically at high risk of mortality, which is compounded by other life-threatening co-morbidities and the rise in antibiotic resistance. Epidemiology studies estimate that the probability of death attributed to S. aureus ranges from 29% to 55% and P. aeruginosa ranges from 24% to 76%. In addition, pneumonia infections can prolong patient stays in ICUs and the use of mechanical ventilation, creating a major economic burden on patients, hospital systems and payors. For example, ICU cost of care for a ventilated pneumonia patient is approximately $10,000 per day, and the duration of ICU stay is typically twice that of a non-ventilated patient (Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. 2010, vol. 31, pp. 509-515). The average cost of care per pneumonia patient is approximately $41,250 which increases 86% for HAP/VAP patients to approximately $76,730. We estimate that our three clinical mAb candidates have an addressable market of $25 billion and the potential to address approximately 325,000 HAP and VAP patients in the U.S. 
         Our proprietary pipeline is primarily focused on severe lung infections and is comprised of six wholly-owned product candidates which are highlighted below. 
      Figure 1 Our Product Pipeline 



AR-301 is a fully human immunoglobulin 1, or IgG1, mAb targeting the gram-positive bacteria S. aureus alphatoxin. We
are developing AR-301 initially as an adjunctive immunotherapy in combination with SOC antibiotics to treat acute
pneumonia caused by S. aureus infection. We filed an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND for AR-301 on June 5, 2015. We 

 6

   

completed
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a trial in 48 HAP and VAP patients. The trial met its primary endpoint of tolerability. AR-301 was generally well tolerated with
no serious adverse events, or SAEs, related to the product candidate, and its pharmacokinetic properties were consistent with that of human IgG1. In addition, the trial showed trends towards benefit
in various patient benefits related endpoints, including improvements in time on ventilator for VAP patients, microbiological eradication rate, time to microbiological eradication, and overall ICU and
hospital stays for AR-301 plus SOC antibiotics compared to antibiotics alone. We initiated a Phase 3 pivotal trial in VAP patients in January 2019. AR-301 has been granted Fast-Track
designation by the FDA, orphan drug designation in the EU, and has filed for orphan drug designation in the U.S. 


AR-105 is a fully human IgG1 mAb targeting the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa. We are developing AR-105 initially as
an adjunctive immunotherapy to treat acute pneumonia caused by P.
aeruginosa infection. We filed an IND for AR-105 on January 8, 2015. In a recent Phase 1 trial in healthy adults, AR-105 was well-tolerated at all dose levels
with no SAEs, and its pharmacokinetic profile was consistent with that of human IgG1. In preclinical studies, AR-105 exhibited broad binding profile and mediated killing of over 90% of clinical
isolates tested. AR-105 also demonstrated protective effects in prophylaxis animal models and synergistic effect in combination with antibiotics. We initiated a global Phase 2 trial in HAP/VAP
patients in the second quarter of 2017 and expect to report interim data in the third quarter of 2019. AR-105 has been granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA. 
AR-101 is a fully human immunoglobulin M, or IgM, mAb targeting the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa serotype O11. We filed an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, or IMPD, with the EU on October 22, 2004. We plan to file an
IND after the initiation of our Phase 2/3 pivotal trial described below. We have completed a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults and a Phase 2a trial in 27 HAP and VAP patients. In the
Phase 2a trial, AR-101 plus SOC antibiotics was generally well tolerated. The per protocol population demonstrated numeric improvement over standalone antibiotics across multiple clinical
endpoints, including initial clinical resolution rate, time to initial clinical resolution, time on ventilator or in ICU and all-cause mortality was seen. We will announce the clinical development
plan for AR-101 following the availability of top-line results from the AR-105 Phase 2 clinical study. AR-101 has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and in the EU. 
AR-401 is our mAb discovery program aimed at treating infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, a
gram-negative bacterium that is increasingly prevalent in blood stream, lung and skin infections. We used our MabIgX
technology to identify novel targets and select several fully human mAb candidates that bind to outer membrane proteins of the bacteria. We intend to select a development candidate for additional
preclinical studies. 
AR-201 is a fully human IgG1 mAb with high affinity for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV,
glycoprotein F and neutralizes diverse clinical isolates of RSV. In in vivo preclinical studies, AR-201 has shown to be 12-fold more potent than Synagis
in a head-to-head comparison study, a currently marketed drug for pediatric RSV. AR-201 has also been shown to bind to RSV strains that are resistant to Synagis. 
AR-501 (Panaecin) is a broad spectrum small molecule anti-infective we are developing in
addition to our targeted mAb product candidates. This product candidate is currently in a phase 1/2a clinical study and is funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. AR-501 is administered as an
inhalable aerosol to treat lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Preclinical studies have shown that mice infected with P. aeruginosa can be
rescued with a single inhalation exposure of aerosolized AR-501. We filed the IND, application and subsequently initiated a Phase 1/2a trial in December 2018. We expect to report top-line
Phase 1 study results in the first 

 7

   

quarter
of 2020. AR-501 has been granted Fast-Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designations by the FDA. 


         To date, we have raised over $91 million in public and private investments. Furthermore, we have been able to augment our own financial resources by obtaining approximately $51 million of non-dilutive awards and grants, including approximately $32 million from the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, the National Institute of Health, or NIH, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and approximately $12 million from the Department of Defense, PATH/Gates Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and other strategic research and development collaborations. We believe that our ability to attract significant financial investments and grant funding underscores the recognized need for new anti-infective products and the strength of our product candidate portfolio. 
         We have assembled a senior management team with substantial product development experience and a successful track record of navigating complex drug development and regulatory pathways. Our management team has over 175 years of combined drug development experience from proven biopharmaceutical companies, such as Abgenix, Inc. Aviron, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Celgene Corporation, MedImmune, LLC and Novartis AG among others, and has contributed to the development and launch of products with multi-billions in annual sales. 
   Strategy 
         Our goal is to become a global leader in anti-infective immunotherapy by discovering, developing and commercializing best-in-class mAbs with the potential to significantly improve upon SOC treatments for life-threatening infections. Key elements of our strategy are as follows: 


 Efficiently advance our product candidates to worldwide approval and
commercialization.  We intend to leverage the favorable regulatory environment in the infectious disease market and closely interact with the FDA,
the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and other regulatory agencies to create efficient clinical development plans and expedite approval pathways for our product candidates. For development
outside of the U.S., we will evaluate potential regional collaborations which may lead to more rapid and cost-effective path to market compared to a standalone strategy. 
 Obtain favorable regulatory designations for our product
candidates.  Regulatory designations can provide numerous benefits for our product candidates, including expedited development pathway and review,
market exclusivity, premium pricing and faster product adoption among others. To date, we have successfully applied for and received Fast Track Designation for AR-301 and AR-105, orphan drug
designation in the U.S. for AR-101 and orphan drug designation in the EU for AR-301 and AR-101. We obtained QIDP, and Fast-track designations for AR-501. We plan to obtain QIDP, Fast-track, and
Breakthrough Therapy designations for our existing and future product candidates to enhance their likelihood of approval and commercial success. 
 Demonstrate pharmacoeconomic benefits of our product
candidates.  We aim to change the treatment paradigm of infectious disease by focusing on the pharmacoeconomic benefits of our product candidates.
We utilize superiority clinical trial designs rather than non-inferiority designs typically used by antibiotics, as positive outcomes from such trials can better demonstrate efficacy and safety
advantages of our product candidates. We target indications where our product candidates may address drivers of high cost of care in hospital settings, such as time on ventilator, ICU stay and
hospital stay. In addition, we will continue to invest resources in market research to better identify and quantify pharmacoeconomic benefits of our product candidates. 
 Implement a targeted commercialization
strategy.  Our core therapeutic indications can be addressed with a relatively small, specialized sales organization. As such, we intend to build
and operate 

 8

   

our
own dedicated sales force to directly market our products in the U.S., to hospitals. For geographies outside of the U.S., we may seek commercial partners with more regional expertise to maximize
the commercial value of our products. 


 Employ our MabIgX antibody discovery platform to expand our product
pipeline.  We believe our MabIgX platform offers us distinct advantages over our peers in terms of new product candidate discovery and
development. We can screen and identify functionally optimized B-cells from patients, and directly manufacture mAbs, by up to one year faster than traditional technologies. Our differentiated approach
reduces mAb discovery and manufacturing time by up to one year compared to traditional technologies. We believe that using our technology, clinical drug supplies can be manufactured within one year
from screening the patient's blood. We intend to continue to use our MabIgX platform to generate new product candidates for bacterial, viral and other infectious diseases where mAb immunotherapy has
the potential to address deficiencies of current treatment alternatives. 
 Continue to pursue grant funding and strategic
collaborations.  To date, we have been awarded approximately $51 million in non-dilutive grant funding. We believe that the industry's need
for novel products, such as our product candidates, makes non-dilutive funding from governmental agencies and research organizations more accessible. Furthermore, our robust pipeline of wholly-owned
product candidates and highly productive discovery platform offer opportunities for value-accretive partnerships. We will continue to pursue grant funding and strategic collaborations in addition to
traditional financings. 

 Market Opportunities 
         Our mission is to improve the treatment of infectious diseases, particularly the deficiencies of conventional antibiotics. It is widely recognized that there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance at a time when the pipeline of antibiotics is dwindling and much of the development activity currently ongoing is devoted to modifications of existing classes of antibiotics. We believe this antibiotic strategy has merely delayed rather than solved the underlying resistance problem as evidenced by the spread of drug resistant bacteria, particularly in the hospital settings. The drug resistance and adverse impact on the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbial flora, brought about by frequent use of broad spectrum antibiotics increased the need for targeted, narrow spectrum anti-infectives that counteract only the etiologic bacterial agent. The ability to identify the infection-causing agent has significantly improved in recent years because of the availability and proliferation of rapid diagnostic tests. These diagnostics have enabled the identification of pathogen profiles within hours of patient sample collection, thus providing physicians with the rapid, precise information necessary to make more informed treatment decisions. Given the identity of the specific pathogen responsible for an infection, we believe the physician is more likely to prescribe a targeted anti-infective, rather than a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Therefore, we believe that the treatment of infectious diseases will see a paradigm shift from broad spectrum antibiotic utilization to narrow, targeted anti-infectives. Such paradigm shift is similar to that observed in oncology starting in the early 2000s, from broad acting chemotherapies to targeted immune-oncology mAbs. Therefore, we believe that the opportunity for application of mAbs in infectious diseases is highly attractive. 
         The current small molecule antibiotics market is crowded, highly competitive, and lacking in product differentiation. The lack of antibiotic product differentiation is traced to the usage of non-inferiority clinical trial designs that is common practice for most of the antibiotics that have been marketed to date. No new class of antibiotic has been introduced to the market within the last two decades, which further heightens the need for new anti-infectives. In addition to significant market differentiation, mAbs may offer substantially less market competition, and higher barrier to entry. Unlike antibiotics, mAbs have a more predictable and attractive safety profile and are designed to kill via an immunological mechanism of action that is different from the mechanisms of action of all 
 9

   antibiotics and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, so long as it binds to such bacteria or their toxins, mAbs are likely unaffected by the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria and will remain effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria. mAbs also have a dosing frequency of once or twice a month and may require only a single administration for treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia. Our mAbs will be used as an adjunct therapy in combination with antibiotics, so they will not directly compete with antibiotics. By improving the outcome in terms of mortality and reducing the time to clinical cure and length of hospital and ICU stay, mAbs offer both a medical benefit to the patient and an economic benefit to the hospital. Our clinical study designs utilize superiority in primary end points, which will allow for clear demonstration of measurable clinical benefits and product differentiation. 
         We are initially focused on respiratory infections in the ICU settings, particularly bacterial pneumonia caused by agents that have approximate prevalence as shown in Figure 2. In the U.S., there are approximately 628,000 cases of HAP and VAP (DRG 2016). HAP due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections results in substantial loss of life with an annual worldwide incidence of approximately 200,000 patients (Decision Resources, 2016 data) and mortality rates as high as 50% depending on the patient population and treatment regimen (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, Decision Resources, 2016). Mechanical Ventilation for VAP patients costs over $30 billion annually in the U.S. Infections due to MRSA represent a high-value segment of the overall antibiotics market. According to this report, the worldwide market for existing therapies for MRSA infections was over $800 million in 2015. The progressively aging population is expected to increase the number of MRSA infections that result in HAP. Moreover, MRSA infections are associated with significantly longer hospital stays, repeated hospitalizations and increased healthcare costs. Currently, the median hospital stay of a patient with VAP is 29 days, and the average length of ICU stay is 19 days. The median total hospitalization costs for a VAP patient is approximately $198,000. Current SOC antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia is dominated by five antibiotics Linezolid, Daptomycin, Vancomycin, Ceftaroline and Tigecycline, which combined have approximately 90% market share. There is a significant need for new anti-MRSA agents given the S. aureus resistance rate of 31% to 53%. We believe that the addition of AR-301 to SOC antibiotics has the potential to improve clinical outcome and could be effective in patients with MRSA infections.

        Pseudomonas infection is caused by strains of bacteria found widely in the environment. P. aeruginosa is one of the most common gram-negative bacteria that is associated with a number of human infections. Drugs targeting gram-negative bacteria must cross both the inner and outer membranes of the bacterial cell, as compared to those directed against gram-positive bacteria, which must only cross one cell membrane. As a result, gram-negative bacteria tend to be more resistant to antibiotics and the body's own immune system. 
         Serious  Pseudomonas infections usually occur in people in the hospital and/or with weakened immune systems. Patients in hospitals, especially those on breathing machines, those with devices such as catheters, and patients with wounds from surgery or from burns are potentially at risk for serious, life-threatening infections. Infections of the blood, pneumonia and infections following surgery can lead to severe illness and death. Pseudomonas infections are generally treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, in hospitalized patients, Pseudomonas infections, such as those caused by many other hospital bacteria, are becoming more difficult to treat because of increasing antibiotic resistance. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas can be deadly for patients in critical care. Figure 3 shows the potential addressable patient population of our three clinical candidates in the US, Europe and Japan (DRG 2016 epidemiological data). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, an estimated 51,000 healthcare-associated P. aeruginosa infections occur in the U.S. each year. More than 6,000, or 13%, of these are multidrug-resistant, leading to roughly 400 deaths per year. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas was given a threat level of "serious threat" in the CDC's report in 2013 titled, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States.
         Cephalosporin and beta lactamases are the most commonly prescribed first line therapy to treat P. aeruginosa pneumonia, but these drugs have a resistance rate of approximately 30%. The lack of new anti-infective agents and the difficulty of developing new anti-infectives to gram-negative pathogens such as  P. aeruginosa has been a public health challenge (Gram Negative Infections, Decision Resources, 2009). Unfortunately, many of the new anti-infectives currently in development are modifications of existing antibiotics, which likely will be susceptible to resistance through the same mechanisms as current therapies. The need is especially acute for  P. aeruginosa, which harbors multi-drug resistant plasmids and is the target of few new drugs under development. As is the case with HAP caused by  S. aureus, there is substantial mortality associated with HAP caused by P. aeruginosa and an annual worldwide incidence of approximately 450,000 patients (Gram Negative Infections, Decision Resources, 2009). This report estimated the worldwide market for existing therapies for HAP due to Gram-negative infections to be $2.0 billion in 2016 and projected it to increase to $3.7 billion by 2026. Additionally, the markets for lung and blood-born infection such as sepsis are characterized by patients who either have a disruption of the normal protective barrier to infection or have an underlying chronic disease such as cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, that leaves the lungs and systemic organs in a weakened state and susceptible to infections by  P. aeruginosa. 
 11



  Cystic Fibrosis with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection 
         There are more than 70,000 patients with cystic fibrosis worldwide. 80% of these patients present with chronic polymicrobial infections, particularly P. aeruginosa infection. We believe the medical need and market potential for an anti-infective therapeutic that can be given to cystic fibrosis patients chronically is substantial. The current market for inhaled antimicrobials for cystic fibrosis, based on recent combined sales figures for TOBI (tobramycin) and Cayston (aztreonam), is approximately $600 million worldwide. Existing therapies such as aminoglycoside antibiotics lead to a temporary improvement in bacterial load, but ultimately 80% to 95% of cystic fibrosis patients succumb to respiratory failure due to chronic P. aeruginosa infection and airway inflammation. P. aeruginosa is the most significant pathogen, with the majority of cystic fibrosis patients becoming chronically infected by the age of 18 years. 
 Our Product Candidates 
         mAbs represent a fundamentally new immunologic approach for treating bacterial infections that can potentially overcome the problems of toxicity and resistance that may occur with traditional antibiotics when they are used long-term in individual patients and pervasively across patient populations. Our product portfolio consists of candidates that have novel mechanisms of action that differ from that of traditional antibiotics and includes five mAb programs, most are discovered using our MabIgX platform technology, and one broad spectrum small molecule anti-infective. 
   AR-301 
         Our lead product candidate, AR-301 is a fully human mAb of IgG1, for the treatment of lung infections resulting from S. aureus including MRSA strains. We are developing AR-301 as an adjunctive therapy with SOC antibiotics to treat HAP and VAP, which is in contrast to other mAb programs currently under development for prevention of HAP and VAP. AR-301 was discovered by screening the B-cell immune response repertoire generated against S. aureus infection. It has received Fast-Track designation in the U.S., Orphan status in the EU and has advanced into a Phase 3 pivotal trial. 
         We completed a Phase 2a clinical trial with AR-301 plus SOC antibiotics compared to SOC antibiotics alone to treat HAP and VAP caused by S. aureus. AR-301 is targeted against S. aureus alphatoxin, which is a toxin produced by most S. aureus strains to cause destruction of human cells and tissues, and in mouse models is thus effective against S. aureus infections whether or not the bacteria are resistant to conventional antibiotics. We believe AR-301 has the potential to positively impact the outcome of S. aureus infections in patients by improving survival rates and/or shortening the duration of overall hospital stays, the length of time a patient requires mechanical ventilation, or the time a patient spends in the ICU. 
   Background and Mechanism of Action 
         AR-301 was discovered by screening B-cell lymphocytes from a patient with a confirmed S. aureus infection. AR-301 binds to alphatoxin with high affinity and prevents its assembly into an active complex, which prevents alphatoxin-mediated breakdown of cell membranes, or lysis, of erythrocytes, human lung cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes (see Figure 4 below). This prevention of killing of host cells, in turn, may protect the patient from further progression of pneumonia disease and systemic infections caused by S. aureus. During infection and active proliferation, S. aureus is metabolically more virulent, geared toward higher toxin production than during its more sessile colonization stage. In contrast to other programs targeting S. aureus colonization, AR-301 targets the active, disease causing infection stage. There is no commercially available product that specifically neutralizes the pathogenic effects brought about by S. aureus toxins. We believe that this mechanism of action complements the bacterial killing properties of many conventional antibiotics, essentially 
 12

   neutralizing the bacterial toxins left behind following antibiotic-mediated killing. Additional indications for AR-301 may include any S. aureus infection, particularly surgical site infections, blood stream infections, endocarditis, and skin and soft tissue infections such as diabetic ulcers and non-healing wounds. 
      Figure 4 AR-301's Mechanism of Action
 
  Clinical Development Summary. 
         We completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, ascending dose Phase 2a clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and pharmacodynamics of a single intravenous administration of AR-301 plus SOC in patients with severe pneumonia caused by S. aureus (Francois, B.  et al., 2018. Intensive Care Medicine journal, in-press). The SOC regimens were the physicians' choice and were based on the individual clinical site's prescribing practice. Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients enrolled in the first cohort (1 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC), eight in the second cohort (3 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC), ten in the third cohort (10 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC) and eight in the fourth cohort (20 mg/kg AR-301 plus SOC). An additional 16 patients received placebo plus SOC as an active control. This Phase 2a clinical trial included 31 sites located across Belgium, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. and was designed primarily to address the safety and pharmacokinetics of AR-301. The drug was generally well tolerated. In exploratory analysis of the VAP subgroup of 25 patients, numeric clinical improvement of antibody treated patients over placebo were observed in time to extubation. Additionally, patients treated with AR-301 exhibited trends toward a higher rate of microbiological eradication, and reduction in number of hospital or ICU days. 
 Phase 2a Safety and Pharmacokinetics. 
         Data from the Phase 2a clinical trial suggest that AR-301 was well tolerated as a treatment for severe pneumonia due to  S. aureus when used as directed and in addition to antibiotics. Few (2.8%) adverse events, or AEs, and no SAEs were deemed related to AR-301 treatment. A total of 36 SAEs were observed, which are listed as follows: septic shock (3 patients or approximately 6.3% of patients), anaemia (3 patients), bacteraemia (2 patients or approximately 4.2% of patients), sepsis (2 patients), acute respiratory failure (2 patients), hypoxia (2 patients), pancreatic abscess (1 patient or 
 13

   approximately 2.1% of patients), pneumonia (1 patient), carbon dioxide increase (1 patient), gamma-glutamyltransferase increase (1 patient), platelet count increase (1 patient), abnormal prothrombin level (1 patient), duodenal ulcer (1 patient), epistaxis (1 patient), hypoventilation (1 patient), pleurisy (1 patient), pulmonary embolism (1 patient), haemodynamic instability (1 patient), hypotension (1 patient), shock haemorrhagic (1 patient), superior vena cava syndrome (1 patient), vena cava thrombosis (1 patient), cardiac arrest (1 patient), coronary artery stenosis (1 patient), ventricular tachycardia (1 patient), multi-organ failure (1 patient), pyrexia (1 patient), hepatic failure (1 patient), hepatocellular injury (1 patient), hypoalbuminaemia (1 patient), malnutrition (1 patient), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (1 patient), coma (1 patient), peripheral motor neuropathy (1 patient), renal failure acute (1 patient), renal failure chronic (1 patient), renal tubular necrosis (1 patient), post procedural haemorrhage (1 patient) and subdural haematoma (1 patient). Immunogenicity was observed in one subject, with no related adverse event. No significant difference in mortality was observed between groups. There were six deaths in the trial, none of which were deemed related to AR-301. Furthermore, the overall mortality observed (8.5%) in this small sample size study was very low when compared to historic published references. The pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of AR-301 is consistent with that of a human IgG1mAb, with a plasma half-life of 23 to 31 days and supports a single-dose administration for the pneumonia indication (Figure 5). 
      Figure 5 Pharmacokinetics Profile of AR-301
 
  Phase 2a clinical Efficacy. 
         We assessed multiple endpoints of clinical improvement including time to extubation. Time intubated to day 28 showed a decrease in the length of time patients who were treated with AR-301 plus SOC remained intubated as compared to those receiving placebo and SOC. When the subset of 25 patients with VAP was assessed, a Kaplan-Meyer analysis of time to extubation showed a separation of the group of patients treated with AR-301 plus SOC as compared to those treated with placebo plus SOC (see Figure 6). In the same subgroup of VAP patients, ventilation time was reduced numerically for patients in all four active dose groups receiving AR-301 plus SOC compared to those receiving 
 14

   placebo plus SOC. In an exploratory analysis, with all four treated cohorts pooled and compared versus the placebo cohort, statistical significance was achieved at p<0.01. The lack of dose response could be attributed to high variability associated with a small sample size, and/or to the high level of circulating AR-301 mAb as compared to alphatoxin load in infected patients, i.e. even at the lowest dose administered (i.e. one mg/kg) it is estimated that there is more than ten-fold mAbs than the predicted alphatoxin load.

        We also determined microbiological outcomes in the overall study population. Eradication or presumed eradication (cured of pneumonia) was observed in 25 (78.1%) patients treated with AR-301 plus SOC and ten (62.5%) of 16 subjects treated with placebo plus SOC. Details of microbiologial outcome by treatment cohort are provided in Figure 7a and the mean time to eradication of  S. aureus bacteria also trended shorter in AR-301 treated cohorts as compared to the Placebo cohort (Figure 7b).

        Figure 7b Mean Time to Microbiological Eradication
 
        When clinical cure was assessed based on the sole judgment of the investigator, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups, and the overall cure rate was high compared to historic published references. Over the first 28 days of the study, the length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, both showed a modest decrease in the AR-301 plus SOC groups as compared to placebo plus SOC-treated subjects, however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. 
         Although SOC antibiotics were effective, the results suggest that the addition of AR-301 to SOC treatment may increase the rate of microbiological eradication, and may reduce time to eradication, time under mechanical ventilation and overall duration of hospital stay. Time ventilated in the pooled AR-301 treated cohorts (n=20) showed an exploratory  p<0.01 reduction in the subset of patients with VAP as compared to the placebo plus SOC cohort (n=5). A manuscript summarizing this clinical study has been published in a peer-reviewed journal Intensive Care Medicine (Francois, B., et al. 'Safety and tolerability of a single administration of AR-301, a human monoclonal antibody, in ICU patients with severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus: first-in-human trial' Intensive Care Medicine. 44(11):1787-1796) 
 Preclinical Summary 
         In vitro studies demonstrated the selective binding of AR-301 to alphatoxin as well as the ability of AR-301 to neutralize toxin effects on several cell models. Antigen specificity and alphatoxin binding were confirmed by performing binding assays using purified bacterial toxins from varied sources including bacterial cell supernatants of the most prevalent epidemic MRSA strains worldwide, and bacterial cell supernatants of an extensive panel of MRSA and methicillin sensitive  S. aureus, or MSSA, clinical isolates. AR-301 was shown to bind to greater than 95% of all S. aureus clinical isolates tested (more than 110 tested). 
         Preclinical testing in an experimental acute S. aureus pneumonia mouse model and sepsis model showed that AR-301 can be used as prophylactic to prevent infection-associated morbidity and mortality or as a therapeutic when delivered intravenously as a stand-alone treatment. For example, in the prophylactic murine lung infection model (see Figure 8), we evaluated the ability of AR-301 to protect against disease. Groups of 15 mice received an intraperitoneal injection of either isotype control 
 16

   antibody (human IgG1) or AR-301 two hours prior to the time of intranasal infection with bacterial strains of interest and were then monitored over 72 hours for lethal disease. The studies were conducted with three distinct S. aureus strains, including Newman, a methicillin-sensitive clinical isolate that maintains a stable virulence phenotype in the laboratory, USA100, a methicillin-resistant hospital isolate, and USA300/LAC, a methicillin-resistant epidemic clone that is the most widely circulated MRSA strain in the U.S. As demonstrated in Figure 8, AR-301 conferred in a dose-dependent manner significant protection against mortality induced by an acute infection with Newman (A), USA100 (B) and USA300 (C). 
      Figure 8 Effect of AR-301 in Prophylactic S. aureus Pneumonia Model
 
        In therapeutic mouse pneumonia studies, AR-301 demonstrated protection against death caused by either the MSSA strain Newman (Figure 9A) or the MRSA strain USA100 (Figure 9B), even when AR-301 was applied up to several hours post infection. Overall, protection decreased (mortality increased) in the groups with later antibody application and with duration of the observation period, thereby suggesting that alphatoxin may be essential, particularly during the early stage of pathogenesis. We believe an extrapolation of these findings to human disease implies that treatment with AR-301 early in the course of S. aureus pneumonia has the potential to delay disease progression, providing a much-needed window of opportunity to enhance the utility of antimicrobial and supportive therapies. 
 17



     Figure 9 Effect of AR-301 in Therapeutic S. aureus Pneumonia Model
 
        Administration of AR-301 mediates protection in a therapeutic S. aureus pneumonia model. Mice were treated with AR-301 two hours prior to intranasal infection or four hours, eight hours, and 12 hours post challenge. For both bacterial MSSA (A) and MRSA (B) isolates tested, a significant decrease in 48 hours mortality was observed for antibody applications up to 12 hours post infection. Statistical significance (p<0.05) is indicated in Figure 9 by an asterisk. 
         To understand the mechanism by which lethal disease was averted by AR-301, bacterial loads in the lungs of mice treated with isotype control IgG1 or AR-301 were assessed 24 hours post-infection. Treatment of mice with isotype control IgG1 antibody or AR-301 two hours prior to the time of infection at a concentration of ten mg/kg each leads to a marked reduction in  S. aureus burden in the lungs. Importantly, this reduction in bacterial load was apparent upon infection with MSSA strain Newman (A) and both hospital-acquired MRSA strain US100 (B) and community-acquired MRSA strain US300 (C). The horizontal bars indicate the mean bacterial load. (see Figure 10). These data support the hypothesis that by neutralizing alphatoxin, AR-301 may mitigate alphatoxin-mediated killing of immune cells, thereby preserving the immune system's natural ability to reduce bacterial burden. 
      Figure 10 Effect of AR-301 on Lung Bacterial Load in a S. aureus Pneumonia Model
 
18

           Collectively, the above preclinical animal infection and treatment studies suggested that treatment with AR-301 resulted in improvement in resolution of disease, and further suggested that neutralizing alphatoxin was necessary and sufficient to confer protection against morbidity and mortality. 
         The toxicology program for AR-301 determined that there was no toxicity in the dose-range pilot study and the repeat-dose toxicity study performed in mice. Further, no treatment-related microscopic changes at the injection sites were observed, thereby confirming good local tolerance of AR-301. 
   Planned Development Activities 
         We plan to conduct two pivotal clinical trials in pneumonia patients for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe. We had an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in June 2017 on the two proposed primary efficacy endpoints, ventilation time and clinical cure, for these two Phase 3 clinical trials. We also submitted a briefing document and received feedback from the EMA's Scientific Advice experts in January 2018. We have reached concurrence with the FDA on a consolidated single primary endpoint, which may include the components of mortality, ventilation requirements and signs and symptoms of pneumonia and presented these to the EMA. Per discussions with clinical experts in the field, approximately a 15% or more improvement of AR-301 plus SOC over placebo plus SOC on these efficacy outcomes is deemed to be clinically meaningful. The first Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled active comparator AR-301 (20 mg/kg) plus SOC versus placebo plus SOC. We plan to enroll approximately 240 VAP microbiologically evaluable patients at approximately 130 clinical sites in over 15 countries. Assuming a treatment effect of clinical cure of 85% versus 65% in active drug treated patients would provide 90% power to demonstrate a statistically significant result. We also reached agreement with the FDA on the size of the safety database required for approval and we plan to include the following safety endpoints: immunogenicity, adverse events, and standard safety laboratory tests. We expect to enroll the first subject in the first quarter of 2019, expect to report an interim data readout in the first half of 2020, and complete enrollment in the second half of 2020. 
   AR-105 
         AR-105 is a broadly active fully human IgG1 mAb targeting P. aeruginosa alginate, a widely distributed cell surface polysaccharide involved in surface adhesion, biofilm formation, and protection against the human immune system. We found that it was expressed in over 90% of  P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from pneumonia patients suggesting the potential for broad coverage. In addition, alginate is highly conserved and we have not identified any escape mutants to date. We believe that AR-105 plus combinations of antibiotics may be beneficial to the overall therapeutic efficacy of treatment regimens because  P. aeruginosa is a problematic, difficult-to-treat bacterium that often requires a combination of antibiotics to effectively treat. 
         An increasing concern with P. aeruginosa infections is the increasing incidence of multi-drug resistant hospital associated lung infections, including HAP and VAP, occurring in patients on mechanical ventilators. It is estimated that the addressable patient population in the United States, EU and Japan combined is approximately 478,000 patients. As a result, we are developing AR-105 plus SOC antibiotics as an adjunctive therapy to treat HAP and VAP. AR-105 was shown to be well tolerated in the recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. We are currently in a global Phase 2 clinical study with this product candidate and project data readout in second half of 2019. 
         Alginate production is a hallmark of chronic P. aeruginosa infection and progressive decline in lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. As a result, we believe that AR-105 can potentially be developed as a therapy to treat P. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis patients. We plan to explore the mAb utility in this indication in the future. 
 19

     Background and Mechanism of Action 
         AR-105 specifically binds to P. aeruginosa alginate expressed on the cell surface of  P. aeruginosa. AR-105 binding activates the C3b component of the complement system, a part of the immune system which binds to the bacterial cell wall in a process called antibody opsonization. The cell surface bound antibody and C3b are then recognized by receptors on the cell surface of immune cells called polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which results in the phagocytosis, or ingestion, and killing of the bacterial cell (see Figure 11). 
      Figure 11 Mechanism of Action of AR-105 mAb
 
  Clinical Development Summary 
         In 2017 we completed an open-label, single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of AR-105 in which all subjects received one intravenous dose of AR-105. The trial consisted of three dose cohorts of AR-105 with safety and pharmacokinetics outcome as shown in Figure 12. Cohort one received two mg/kg of AR-105 (n=five subjects), cohort two received eight mg/kg of AR-105 (n=six subjects), and cohort three received 20 mg/kg of AR-105 (n=five subjects). The dose levels for the study were selected based on animal studies showing prophylactic and therapeutic effects in a pneumonia animal model and toxicological studies. The results showed that AR-105 was well tolerated at all dose levels tested, with no SAEs observed, and a total of 14 AEs that were deemed to be non-remarkable and typical of mAb infusion (e.g. infusion site edema, headache, etc.). Furthermore, the PK profile of AR-105 was found to be consistent with the known PK profiles of IgG1 mAbs.

  Preclinical Activity Summary 
         In in vitro studies, AR-105 demonstrated the ability to bind to and kill a wide range (greater than 90%) of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from pneumonia patients through opsonic phagocytosis. These clinical isolates included  P. aeruginosa strains with varying levels of antibiotic resistance to TOBI (tobramycin) and Cayston (aztreonam) suggesting that AR-105's activity is independent of the antibiotic resistance status of a given P. aeruginosa strain. 
         Several preclinical animal models have demonstrated the protective activity of AR-105 treatment against P. aeruginosa infections. AR-105 prevented both morbidity and mortality resulting from infection when administered intravenously either prophylactically or therapeutically in an acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia mouse model. AR-105 had a synergistic effect when combined with antibiotics tobramycin (Figure 13 Left Panel) or meropenem (Figure 13 Right Panel) in P. aeruginosa infected mice exhibiting severe pneumonia (Figure 13). 
 21



     Figure 13 Synergistic Protection of P. aeruginosa Infected Mice Using AR-105 and Antibiotic Tobramycin (left) or Meropenem (right)
 
        In the study depicted above, infected mice were treated with sub-protective dose levels of AR-105 (0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg, once via nasal administration) and either tobramycin or meropenem (1.4 and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively, daily via intravenous administration) separately and in combination, followed by assessment of lung bacterial load (measured as colony forming units, or CFUs) at T=0 and 24 hours post-drug treatments. The combination of AR-105 and tobramycin or meropenem showed lower bacterial load than either treatment individually. 
         Therapeutic protection by AR-105 was also demonstrated in a mouse model of sepsis where the infection was initiated by an intraperitoneal injection of P. aeruginosa followed by an intraperitoneal injection with escalating doses of AR-105 four hours later. Treatment with AR-105 resulted in protection from the lethality of the  P. aeruginosa infection. Increasing doses of AR-105 resulted in increased protection. Collectively, the results of these preclinical studies demonstrated that AR-105 is highly effective in mice in attenuating pulmonary and septic infections caused by P. aeruginosa. 
 Planned Development Activities 
         We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in VAP patients on mechanical ventilation in the second quarter of 2017. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, active comparator trial with a single dose of AR-105 (20 mg/kg) plus SOC antibiotics or placebo plus SOC antibiotics. This study is being conducted at approximately 108 sites in 18 countries, in the U.S., EU, Latin America, Australia, and Asia. This study is designed to detect superiority in the primary endpoint of clinical cure rate on day 14 at p-value of 0.05. We expect to announce top-line data from this study in the second half of 2019. 
 22

     AR-101 
         AR-101 is a human IgM mAb that we are developing to treat P. aeruginosa, the leading cause of hospital acquired lung infections. AR-101, which we are initially developing as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of HAP and VAP caused by P. aeruginosa serotype O11, binds to the lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, on the cell surface of P. aeruginosa. Serotype O11 is one of the most prevalent P. aeruginosa serotypes in HAP and VAP, representing approximately 23% of cases (Lu et al 2014). It is estimated that the addressable patient population in the U.S., EU and Japan combined is approximately 95,600 patients. AR-101 has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and in the EU. We intend to incorporate a companion diagnostic test based on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, technology that can rapidly identify P. aeruginosa serotype O11 strains in order to identify those patients most likely to respond to AR-101. We have completed a Phase 1 safety and tolerability trial of single ascending doses of AR-101 in healthy adults and an open-label Phase 2a safety and pharmacokinetics trial of up to three single doses of AR-101 in pneumonia patients. These studies suggested AR-101 to be generally well tolerated in both healthy adults and HAP and VAP patients. Comparison of the per protocol population (n=13) of the Phase 2a study, which excluded four patients from the ITT population (n=17) because they did not complete the treatment regimen, and a contemporaneous control cohort suggested that AR-101 therapy may improve survival, cure rate of the index pneumonia, and time to cure pneumonia. 
      Figure 14. AR-101 Mechanism of Action
 
  Background and Mechanism of Action 
         Upon binding, AR-101 mediates the deposition of the human complement to the surface of  P. aeruginosa bacteria. This antibody-complement complex leads to improved recognition by the host immune cells, which results in engulfment and killing of the bacteria (Figure 14). AR-101, like IgM antibodies in general, provides several advantages towards more effective bacterial killing. They possess ten binding sites rather than two for IgG, and they are 100 to 1,000 times more effective than IgG at binding and/or activating key enzymes that facilitate the killing of P. aeruginosa. As a result, IgM antibodies are becoming more prevalent as candidates for drug therapies. 
 23

     Clinical Development Summary 
         We have completed two clinical studies of AR-101 to date. We completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics of AR-101. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 32 volunteers in four antibody treatment cohorts at doses of 0.1, 0.4, 1.2 and 4.0 mg/kg as well as placebo cohort. No SAEs were observed, and no subject was discontinued due to an AE. Reported AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, and all resolved without sequelae, and the incidence of AEs did not increase with the dose. There was no activation of an immune response against AR-101. Pharmacokinetic characteristics that were observed were consistent with the characteristics of a human IgM, with a serum half-life between 70 and 95 hours. 
         Subsequently, we completed an open-label Phase 2a study in 18 subjects, which was the first study performed in the target indication of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa serotype O11. Treatment consisted of three intravenous infusions of 1.2 mg/kg of AR-101 given over two hours on days one, four and seven for a total dose of 3.6 mg/kg. The 30-day survival rates were 82% and 100% in the intent-to-treat (ITT; 17 subjects) and the per protocol (13 subjects) populations, respectively. Clinical resolution of pneumonia was observed in 76% of patients in the ITT population and 100% of patients in the per protocol population. Microbiological resolution was observed in six subjects, representing 35% of the ITT population and 31% of the per protocol population. The time to resolution of pneumonia was 14 days and nine days in the ITT and per protocol populations, respectively. The time to extubation or cessation of ICU management was 22 days in the ITT and 13 days in the per protocol populations, respectively. Measurements of clinical status improved promptly in parallel with clinical resolution of disease. 
         14 SAEs were experienced by six of the subjects. The types of SAEs were: gastrointestinal bleeding (3 patients or approximately 21% of patients), cardiac and respiratory arrest (2 patients or approximately 14% of patients), multi-organ failure (2 patients), hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis (1 patient or approximately 7% of patients), neutropenia (1 patient), low count of platelets (1 patient), activated partial thromboplastin time (1 patient), prolongation (1 patient), septic shock (1 patient); cholestasis (1 patient) and troponin increase (due to cardiac arrest) (1 patient). An event of cardiorespiratory arrest was judged as probably related to AR-101 and events of hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis, although pre-existent, were deemed possibly related. In both cases, the investigators assessed that a contribution by AR-101 to the adverse event could not be excluded with certainty but acknowledged other probable causes were acknowledged. The other SAEs were deemed unrelated. 
         In parallel, we also conducted a contemporaneous cohort study of the incidence and outcome of HAP and VAP caused by various P. aeruginosa serotypes in critically ill patients. The data were extracted from the medical files of the patients selected according to eligibility criteria similar to those of our Phase 2a study. Cohort patients infected with P. aeruginosa serotype O11 (14 patients in total) had a lower survival rate, cure rate, and microbiological resolution rate, as well as longer mean times on ventilator and in the ICU as compared to patients in our Phase 2a clinical trial who received a complete treatment of three 1.2 mg/kg doses of AR-101. A summary of the results of the Phase 2a study and the contemporaneous cohort study is shown in Figure 15 below.

  Preclinical Summary 
         AR-101 reacts with a wide range of P. aeruginosa serotype O11 clinical isolates from different hospitals, indicating broad application against infections with this serotype. AR-101 is also capable of stimulating phagocytic immune cells to ingest P. aeruginosa bacterial cells in a dose dependent manner, thereby killing the pathogen. Passive immunization with murine mAb recognizing O-polysaccharides in LPS of  P. aeruginosa conferred protection against lethal challenge with live pseudomonas bacteria in several animal models of pneumonia infections. In preclinical studies, AR-101 was found to demonstrate attenuating protection against pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa serotype O11 and exhibited a complementary effect with meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Additionally, we had the following observations in preclinical studies of AR-101. AR-101 protected mice in a dose-dependent manner from P. aeruginosa infection after a burn-wound challenge. Doses of five mg/mouse (corresponding to about 0.2 mg/kg body weight) conferred 70% to 100% protection from systemic P. aeruginosa challenge. Administration of decreasing doses resulted in lower survival rates and administration of AR-101 led to rapid clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lung in mice and was associated with milder lung pathology six and 24 hours after infection. In addition, AR-101-treated animals had a significantly lower systemic P. aeruginosa bacterial load compared to control animals that received saline. To mimic the adjunctive use of AR-101 in humans, AR-101 was administered in combination with meropenem (used clinically to treat pseudomonal infections) in a modified lung challenge model. When meropenem and AR-101 were administered in combination, significant reductions in lung weight (a surrogate marker for injection-induced inflammation), bacterial load and lung inflammation were observed in infected mice compared to each agent given alone. 
 Planned Development Activities 
         We plan to initiate a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial as an adjunct to SOC antibiotics in the first half 2020. The clinical trial will enroll adult patients with HAP or VAP. As with the prior Phase 2a study, the primary efficacy endpoint in this study will include clinical cure rate. Time to clinical cure was an endpoint that achieved statistical significance in the Phase 2a 
 25

   study (p=0.005) and will be evaluated in detail in the Phase 2/3 study. We will also assess microbiological endpoints as well as select pharmacoeconomic endpoints and pharmacokinetics. 
   AR-201 
         We have obtained a high affinity anti-RSV F-protein mAb, which we refer to as AR-201. RSV is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide. In premature neonates, RSV infection results in high levels of morbidity. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 234,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths per year attributable to RSV. The only prophylaxis for RSV is Synagis (palivizumab), a humanized murine mAb that targets the RSV glycoprotein F and has been shown to reduce the rate of RSV-associated hospitalization by 50%. Synagis-resistant RSV strains are rising, which emphasize the need for additional anti-RSV products against different epitopes. Tonsils of RSV-infected patients were used as a B-cell source for screening new antibody candidates with improved activity against RSV F-protein. 
         Compared to Synagis, AR-201 has higher affinity for F protein (700 pM versus 60 pM) and superior in vitro neutralization activity. AR-201 was found to bind to naturally occurring Synagis-resistant strains. AR-201's epitope is distinct from that of Synagis, and as a result, can potently neutralize Synagis-resistant isolates. Preliminary cotton rat testing demonstrates that AR-201 provides comparable protection to Synagis in this animal model. We intend to develop AR-201 for the prevention of RSV in neonates and in additional high-risk patients. As part of a recent NIH Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, award, we are using recombinant approaches to extend the half-life of AR-201 to create a potential for once-a-season dosing, which we believe will provide opportunities for introduction of anti-RSV prophylaxis into worldwide markets that are not served by the existing Synagis product. 
   AR-401 
         AR-401 is our mAb discovery program aimed at treating infections caused by A. baumannii, which is a gram-negative pathogen that is rapidly emerging as a serious threat to patients in hospital care. Its high level of resistance to first-line antibiotic therapies, potential to survive prolonged periods on dry surfaces and ability to form biofilms rapidly on artificial devices, such as catheters and ventilators, have made it particularly virulent. The clinical impact of  A. baumannii infections can have serious adverse consequences with crude mortality rates reaching 30% in infected ICU patients. Moreover, infection with A. baumannii leads to an increased length of stay at the ICU of an average of 15 extra days. We intend to develop an anti-A. baumannii human mAb to address the unmet medical need for new and effective anti-infectives to treat severe and life-threatening infections caused by this difficult-to-treat bacterium. 
         We have made significant progress toward the identification of potential anti-microbial targets on A. baumannii, which we believe will facilitate the development of both active and passive immune-based therapies. We believe our preliminary target identification work on A. baumannii is among the most comprehensive to date. We used a proteomic approach to identify bacterial surface proteins that are accessible to the immune system. We then performed a thorough analysis using multiple bioinformatic tools that reduced the number of identified proteins to eight outer membrane proteins on A. baumannii. Our studies showed that active immunization with each protein reduced mortality in a pneumonia model. Antibodies against these A. baumannii targets were also detected in the majority of A. baumannii infected patient sera. Polyclonal rabbit immune sera raised against these targets mediated protection in the  Acinetobacter pneumonia mouse model as shown by a reduction of mortality and clinical score. 
         Of the eight surface proteins identified as potential targets for mAbs, three have been previously characterized. The five remaining proteins are of unknown function, potentially representing completely 
 26

   unique and innovative targets. Antibody titers to all eight proteins can be detected in sera of convalescent patients whereas sera from healthy donors from a regional blood bank have only very low or undetectable antibody serum titers to these proteins. An initial study demonstrated that the peripheral blood lymphocytes, or PBL, from patients with a high serum titer can result in hybridoma cell lines that specifically stain A. baumannii cells. Our planned next step for this program is to select a lead therapeutic mAb and advance into  in vitro potency testing and in vivo assessment of therapeutic efficacy in an A. baumannii challenge mouse model. 
   AR-501 
         We are developing AR-501 (gallium(III) citrate) as an anti-infective therapy to manage both chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients and acute pneumonia in HAP and VAP patients AR-501 exhibits broad antimicrobial activity against antibiotic resistant gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in free-living, or planktonic, and biofilm communities, as well as against fungi. We believe AR-501's unique combination of broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against pathogens, lower propensity to develop resistance than inhaled TOBI (tobramycin) and Cayston (aztreonam), and less frequent dosing as compared to SOC, make it an ideal candidate for treatment of chronic polymicrobial infections, such as lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. AR-501 has been granted Fast-Track and QIDP designations by the FDA. 
         To enhance delivery to the lungs and provide a simple method of administration, we are developing AR-501 as an inhaled formulation that can be administered conveniently with one of several commercially available liquid nebulization devices. We were awarded a development grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for up to approximately $7.5 million to develop an aerosolized formulation of AR-501 to manage bacterial lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. We have produced, good manufacturing practice, or GMP, clinical bulk drug that is ready for use in human clinical trials, and we have completed good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicology studies. We believe that the novel characteristics of AR-501, namely broad spectrum activity, lower propensity to develop resistance, and long half-life, may enable cystic fibrosis patients to avoid the current need for the intermittent "drug holidays" commonly employed with SOC drugs such as TOBI (tobramycin). The novel characteristics of AR-501 may also benefit patients with other infectious lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia. 
   Background and Mechanism of Action 
         AR-501 is a proprietary formulation of gallium(III) citrate. Trivalent ions of the element gallium (Ga) have biologic activity because Ga(III) chemically mimics the ferric iron ions (Fe(III)) that bacteria and many other microorganisms require for survival. Bacterial iron-binding proteins imperfectly distinguish Ga(III) from Fe(III), functionally starving bacteria of iron and poisoning critical Fe(III)-dependent metabolic pathways. We believe this novel mechanism of action is distinct from those underlying all current antibiotics. 
         There is a long history of administering gallium(III) salts to humans. Gallium scans are used as diagnostic tests to identify areas of inflammation, infection, or cancer in the body, and Ganite, a formulation of gallium(III) nitrate, was introduced in 2003 as an FDA-approved intravenous treatment for hypercalcemia secondary to cancer. The anti-infective activity was only recently demonstrated using gallium(III) nitrate in citrate buffer. Our in vitro tests and in vivo animal studies show that gallium(III) citrate exhibits the same antimicrobial activity as gallium(III) nitrate in citrate buffer, demonstrating that Ga(III) ion itself, and not any particular salt form, is responsible for the anti-infective activity.

     Clinical Data Summary 
         More than 50 published human clinical trials conducted in more than 1,000 cancer patients attest to the safety of systemic Ga(III) compounds and establish a tolerated dose that greatly exceeds the dose at which we project AR-501 will be used. Recently an open-label Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of Ganite administered intravenously to cystic fibrosis patients showed evidence of an improvement in lung function and reduction of P. aeruginosa burden in the lungs. Investigators at the University of Washington, or UW, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation conducted the clinical study, and we analyzed patient samples to determine pharmacokinetics. The aim of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics, lung distribution, and safety of intravenous Ga(III) in cystic fibrosis patients. This non-randomized Phase 1 study comprised two dosing cohorts (cohort one: n=9 patients, cohort two: n=11 patients). Analysis of subjects' sputum, urine, and plasma showed persistent Ga(III) levels in sputum up to 28 days after a single dose. Encouragingly, a number of patients in both cohorts showed significant reduction in sputum P. aeruginosa and an improvement in steady forced expiratory volume (FEV1) throughout the 28 days. We anticipate that inhaled AR-501 can result in at least 100-fold higher Ga(III) concentration in the lungs. The UW investigators continue to develop Ganite as an intravenous treatment for cystic fibrosis associated lung infections and recently initiated a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 clinical study in cystic fibrosis patients. This study was completed in the second half of 2018 and provided clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of Ga(III) in cystic fibrosis patients (see Goss, C. et al. The Ignite Study: IV Gallium Nitrate As A Treatment For Chronic Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection In CF. North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference Abstract number 307, 2018). 
 Preclinical Data Summary 
         AR-501 exhibits antimicrobial activity in diverse in vitro and in vivo bacterial infection models. The in vitro activity of Ga(III) salts extends to many gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria, and in vivo activity has been demonstrated against P. aeruginosa when administered via inhalation and intraperitoneal injection. We showed that persistent exposure of P. aeruginosa to gallium(III) citrate did not change the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, whereas parallel studies demonstrated a greater than eight-fold rise in MIC for the antibiotics tobramycin, vancomycin, or aztreonam. Thus, we believe that for mechanistic reasons, bacteria are less likely to develop resistance to Ga(III) compounds than to conventional antibiotics. Pharmacokinetic studies of inhaled AR-501 in mice showed the initial half-life was 0.6 hours and the terminal half-life was 40.0 hours. In preclinical animal lung infection studies, AR-501 at an inhaled dose as low as 3.7 mg/kg is protective against a lethal challenge with P. aeruginosa strain PA103. 
         We tested the local effects of inhaled Ga(III) on lung tissues by examining the acute pulmonary toxicity of inhaled gallium(III) nitrate formulated in a citrate buffer in mice. We exposed animals to aerosolized gallium(III) nitrate formulated in a citrate buffer (12.5 mg/mL) for two, four, or six hours in a whole body exposure chamber. Histopathological evaluation revealed no significant changes in lung tissues. Inflammation was observed that reached a maximum at four to eight hours post dosing but waned beyond eight hours. Mice and subsequently dogs that were administered AR-501 by inhalation once per week for 28 days (five administrations), showed unremarkable clinical chemistry findings, and no significant adverse observations were noted in the lungs or kidneys. The no observed adverse effect level from the GLP toxicology testing has been established. 
   Planned Development Activities 
         Our AR-501 development program includes toxicity testing in two animal species in accordance with GLP requirements to assess the safety of AR-501 administered by inhalation. The program includes GLP toxicology studies in mice and dogs, encompassing both single dose and repeated dose administration of AR-501 by inhalation. We submitted an IND to the FDA in September 2018 in which 
 28

   we proposed a two-part, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and respiratory lung function measures following the administration of inhaled AR-501 first in normal healthy adults, then in adult cystic fibrosis patients. We initiated the Phase 1/2a clinical study in December 2018. 
   Our MAbIgX Fully Human Antibody Discovery Platform 
         Our proprietary MabIgX discovery platform enables us to rapidly screen, identify and optimize fully human therapeutic mAb product candidates directly from the B-cells of patients. We have developed a method of selecting rare, potent B-cells isolated either from convalescent individuals who have successfully survived an infection with the pathogen or healthy individuals who have been actively immunized with a vaccine against a target pathogen. These B-cells produce antibodies that are highly relevant for the body's defense against a particular pathogen and which we believe will be highly protective mAb therapeutic product candidates. Our mAb product candidates are of completely human origin, which we believe maximizes the antibodies' protection and effector functions and minimizes the risk of adverse reactions. Our MabIgX technology platform does not require the use of recombinant antibody technologies or any genetic engineering steps that can be time consuming and may be protected by third party intellectual property rights. 
         We believe our MabIgX drug discovery platform, which enables us to rapidly identify and manufacture naturally occurring fully human antibody product candidates, provides us with the following competitive advantages:
 

 ability to rapidly screen for rare and potent B-cells to produce differentiated mAb product candidates and expeditiously progress product
candidates from target identification to clinical development; 
 broad applicability to produce immunologically and clinically relevant product candidates across all relevant immunoglobulin isotypes,
including IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies; 
 discovery of mAb product candidates with high efficacy due to recognition of epitopes relevant for humans; 
 generation of mAb product candidates that are well tolerated and that have the potential for multiple administrations due to low
immunogenicity, or nominal ability to provoke an anti-drug immune response; and 
 ability to rapidly progress to clinical manufacturing by avoiding the need for time consuming recombinant antibody engineering processes and
production cell lines. 

         Our MabIgX technology platform is summarized in Figure 16. 
 29

        Figure 16. MabIgX B-cell Discovery and Manufacturing Process Flow
 
        The first step in our process is the selection of immunized or convalescent patients who serve as donors for blood collection. We have collaborations with physicians as well as specialized clinical sites for the selection, recruitment and blood collection of convalescent donors. We also have established protocols for the selection of donors and the optimal time for blood collection, both of which depend largely on the targeted infection and the desired isotype of the desired mAb. 
         Then we apply classical hybridoma technology, whereby the human B-cells of the donors are isolated, transiently immortalized by infection with Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, and subsequently fused to the proprietary heteromyeloma cell line LA55 to form stable hybridoma lines. Our technology enables us to overcome one of the major challenges in developing human therapeutic mAbs, which is the inability to easily select and culture antigen-induced mAb-producing human B-cells and to use them to construct continuous mAb-producing cell lines. We have defined the properties of circulating antigen-specific human B-cells recruited through the immune response to polysaccharide and protein antigens, and have optimized their enrichment and propagation in culture for the production of fully human mAbs. After isolation, these highly antigen-specific human B-cells are immortalized employing LA55, which generates stable hybridomas for large scale manufacturing of our fully human mAbs. 
         Our technology enables us to isolate and select the most relevant and most effective human antibodies for a specific pathogen. Not all pathogens require the same type of immune effector function, and therefore, our immune system has developed a set of different antibody isotypes with very specific characteristics. For example, high-affinity IgG antibodies are more efficient at neutralizing viruses and preventing infections whereas IgM antibodies can more efficiently attack gram-negative bacteria by targeting the bacterial surface polysaccharides and by activating complement, which leads to a "flagging" of the bacteria, known as opsonization, and ultimately the destruction of the bacteria by the immune system. It is important to isolate antibodies of the proper isotype based on the infection targeted and the desired reaction of the human immune system. Our MabIgX technology enables the isolation of the isotype of an antibody that the human immune system utilizes to combat a particular pathogen and isolate all different isotypes. All those antibodies retain their effector function, which is an important factor in the regulation of an effective immune reaction in the human body (see Figure 17).

   Intellectual Property 
         Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents and other proprietary protections of our commercially important technologies and product candidates, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to maintain trade secrets or other proprietary know-how, both in the U.S. and other countries. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products will depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that protect these activities. We seek to protect proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. 
         As of December 31, 2018, our patent estate includes approximately 58 issued patents (approximately 23 of which are in the U.S.) and approximately 26 pending patent applications (approximately seven of which are in the U.S.), which we either own or for which we have an exclusive commercial license (either in its entirety or within our field of use), as is more fully described below. Our patent families related to our product candidates are described below. 
   AR-301: Anti-Staphylococcus aureus HLA alphatoxin mAb 
         Our AR-301 patent estate includes a patent family that we own related to AR-301 titled "Human Monoclonal Antibody against  S. aureus derived alphatoxin and its use in treating or preventing abscess formation" which has a priority date of August 10, 2009. Issued claims include: composition of matter claims to a human mAb that binds to S. aureus alphatoxin and a cell line producing the antibody. Patents in this family have been issued in Europe, the U.S., China, Israel, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. National patent applications are currently pending in Canada and Brazil. Issued patents are expected to expire in 2030, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The portfolio is complemented by a patent family in-licensed from University of Chicago and titled "Methods and Compositions related to Immunizing Against Staphylococcal Lung Diseases and Conditions." This patent family includes ten patents, which are granted in jurisdictions including Australia, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, and the U.S., and six patent applications that are pending in Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2028, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 31

     AR-105: Anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa alginate mAb 
         Our AR-105 patent estate includes two patent families that have been exclusively in-licensed from the Brigham Women's Hospital (Harvard University). The first family is titled "P.aeruginosa Mucoid Exopolysaccharide Specific Binding Peptides" and it is comprised of three issued U.S. patents that are expected to expire in 2022, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The second family is titled "Methods and compositions relating to mannuronic acid specific binding peptides," and it comprises one European patent that is expected to expire in 2025, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Claims in these patents include composition of matter, uses and methods of inducing immune response to the alginate epitope. We own a pending PCT application that, if nationalized and issued, is expected to expire in 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
   AR-101: Anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS serotype O11 mAb 
         Our AR-101 patent estate includes a patent family, titled "Human Monoclonal Antibody Specific for LPS of serotype IATS 011 Pseudomonas aeruginosa," with issued patents in seven jurisdictions including Canada, Europe, China, India, Israel, Japan, and the U.S. The issued patents include claims directed to certain antibodies, variants or Fab fragments thereof, hybridomas producing the antibodies, as well as nucleic acids encoding the antibodies. In the U.S. issued claims are directed to antibodies with specific variable region sequences that bind LPS of the P. aeruginosa LPS serotype IATS 011, or with variable region sequences having 85% identity thereto. Similar claims were granted in Europe, Canada, China, Israel, India and Japan. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2026, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Additionally, we own a U.S. patent covering the O6 serotype of P. aeruginosa LPS titled "Human Monoclonal Antibody Specific for LPS of Serotype IATS O6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa". This issued US patent is expected to expire in 2026, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
   AR-501: Gallium citrate 
         Our AR-501 patent estate includes three patent families, two of which we own and one of which is in-licensed from the University of Iowa Research Foundation. These patents are directed to Gallium containing formulations for anti-infective indications and methods of using the same. These patent families include granted patents in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.S. The in-licensed issued patents are expected to expire in 2024 and the patents that we own are expected to expire in 2030, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.

         Our patent estate for AR-201 comprises two U.S. patent and pending patent applications in Canada, China, Europe and India titled "Human Monoclonal Antibody Specific for the F Protein of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)." Claims in the U.S. patents are directed to antibodies with specificity to a region of RSV F protein, methods of producing certain antibodies and methods of treating or preventing RSV infections with such antibodies. The U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2034 andin case of grant-currently pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2035, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
   AR-401: Anti-Acinetobacter baumannii mAb 
         Our patent estate for AR-401 includes a patent family titled "Novel targets of Acinetobacter baumannii" with priority to 2011. This family includes issued patents in Australia, China, Europe and the U.S. Patent applications are pending in Canada, China (divisional), Japan (divisional) and the U.S. (divisional). Claims in these patents and applications include those directed to certain vaccine 
 32

   compositions and to mAb against outer membrane protein targets. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2032, and any patents that may issue from the pending patent applications are expected to expire in 2032, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
         Complementing the product specific patents is a pharmaceutical processing and formulation technology related portfolio comprising five patent families of which one was in-licensed. The patent families consist of nine national patents and patent applications on formulation and delivery technologies. The issued patents have expected expiration ranges between 2022 and 2030, and the pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2022 and 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Claims in the patents are directed to formulation, stabilization, and delivery of pharmaceuticals. 
         We are also actively pursuing additional patent applications in the U.S. and foreign patent jurisdictions for other preclinical product candidates and methods of use, including additional product candidates for infectious disease. In addition, we will pursue patent protection whenever it is deemed sufficiently beneficial for any product or product candidate and related technology we develop and/or acquire in the future. 
         The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether the product candidates we are developing will gain patent protection or, if patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented, invalidated, or found to be unenforceable. Because patent applications in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions or filing dates covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant proceedings, interference proceedings, or third-party ex parte or inter partes reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, any of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid and enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. To the extent it is prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights. 
         The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. Some of our patents currently benefit from patent term adjustment and some of our patents that will be issued in the future may benefit from patent term adjustment. 
         The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved product may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the product is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved product may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved product. In the future, if and when 
 33

   our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent-term extensions on patents covering those products. 
         To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and there can be no assurance that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third-parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to avoid infringing third-party patent and proprietary rights. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. 
         We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. However, we believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our products. 
         It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be and are our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.

 Public Health Service Licensing Agreements 
   NIHExclusive and Non-Exclusive Patent License Agreement 
         We are party to an exclusive and non-exclusive licensing agreement, or the NIH Agreement, with the NIH on July 11th, 2005 relating to rotavirus vaccine development. This agreement granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. and non-exclusive rights worldwide under its rights in a human rotavirus vaccine based on their human-bovine rotavirus reassortants to make, use and sell products and processes that are covered by such patent rights. The NIH Agreement also granted to us the right to sublicense. 
         Our license under this agreement is subject to the U.S. government's retained rights under a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license for the practice of all inventions licensed under the Public Health Service, or PHS, patent rights, by or on behalf of the U.S. government and on behalf of any foreign government or international organization pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement to which the U.S. government is a signatory. For purposes of encouraging basic research, the U.S. government also reserves the right to grant or require us to grant to a third party on reasonable terms a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to make and use the licensed products or licensed processes for research purpose only, but subject to PHS consulting with us in the event such third party is a commercial entity. Under certain exceptional and enumerated circumstances, the U.S. government may require us to grant a sublicense to a responsible third party applicant, on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. The PHS takes responsibility for all aspects of the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of any and all patent applications or patents included in the licensed PHS patent rights, subject to our payment of certain patent-related expenses. 
         We also are obligated to pay PHS low single digit percentage royalties on net sales from our and our sublicensee's sale of any commercialized licensed product or process with a minimum royalty required per year, and certain other payments.

PHS is responsible for diligently prosecuting and maintaining the licensed PHS patent rights, and we reimburse them for a portion of their costs. 
         The agreement provides that we have certain obligations to conduct further research and development, and are obligated to utilize reasonable efforts to commercialize, either directly or through a sublicensee, the licensed PHS patent rights as licensed products or processes. 
         The term of the NIH Agreement continues until expiration of all royalty obligations, included within the licensed PHS patents, or until the agreement is earlier terminated. We may terminate the agreement upon 60 days prior written notice to PHS. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement for the other party's uncured material breach of obligations under the agreement. In addition, the NIH Agreement will terminate upon any of the following events:
 

 We become insolvent or involved in a bankruptcy petition; 
 We do not meet certain obligations of the NIH Agreement; 
 Public health and safety require the termination of the NIH Agreement; or 
 We do not satisfy certain federal regulation public use requirements.

  Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Agreement 
         In December 2016, pursuant to a letter agreement between us and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, we received an award for up to $2.9 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to advance research on potential drugs utilizing inhaled gallium citrate anti infective. On November 26, 2018, pursuant to an amendment to the letter agreement, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation increased the potential award to up to approximately $7.5 million. Under the award agreement, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will make payments to us as certain milestones are met. The award agreement also contains a provision whereby if we spend less on developing a potential drug utilizing inhaled gallium citrate anti infective than we actually receive under this award agreement, we will be required to return the excess portion of the award to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
         In the event that development efforts are successful and we commercialized a drug from these related development efforts, we may be subject to pay to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation a one-time amount equal to nine times the awarded amount. Such amount shall be paid in not more than five annual installments. 
         In the event that we license rights to the product in the field to a third party, sell the product, or consummate a change of control transaction prior to the first commercial sale, we shall pay to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation an amount equal to (i) fifteen percent (15%) of the amounts received by us and our shareholders in connection with such disposition or (ii) up to nine times the actual awarded amount. 
   Program for Appropriate Technology in Health and PATH Vaccine Solutions 
         We granted the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, or PATH, a global non-profit organization, and the PATH Vaccine Solutions a non-exclusive license, with right to sublicense formulations, for use with the measles, rotavirus, live-attenuated influenza, pneumococcal and enteric vaccines only for sale in developing countries. 
         We have also agreed to provide rotavirus vaccines to public sector purchasers in developing countries at a preferential price relative to private sector purchasers in developing countries where the rotavirus vaccine utilizing the enabling formulation technology is offered for sale. 
   Corporate Licensing Arrangements 
   Kenta Biotech Ltd. 
         We are a party to an asset purchase agreement with Kenta Biotech Ltd., or Kenta, a for profit corporation duly incorporated in Schlieren (Canton of Zurich, Switzerland). The asset purchase agreement contains a licensing arrangement based upon the worldwide out-licensing or net sales of certain of Kenta's physical assets, contracts and technology. Pursuant to such agreement, we were obligated to pay Kenta a fixed purchase price, which was fully paid during 2013 and 2014, and are obligated to pay a declining scale of royalties on gross licensing revenues from either out-licensing of the assets or net sales revenues actually received by us up to a maximum of $50,000,000. 
         The agreement also assigned and transferred certain of Kenta's physical assets, contracts and technology to us. The physical assets included all physical assets owned or controlled by Kenta, including but not limited to cell lines, genes, antibodies, diagnostic assays and related documentation, which were related to Kenta's MabIgX technology platform for hybridoma generation and its mAb targeting S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and RSV. The technology included all intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, patent applications, trademarks, knowhow, trade secrets, regulatory filings, clinical trials, clinical trial information, all supporting documentation and all other related intellectual property which are related to Kenta's MabIgX technology platform for hybridoma generation and its mAb targeting  S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and RSV. The contracts 
 38

   included the contracts and agreements (including all rights and obligations thereunder), whether oral or written, which Kenta has concluded and which pertain to the assets. The contracts were primarily related to the ongoing clinical trial of AR-301. 
   Emergent Product Development Gaithersburg Inc. 
         We are party to a license agreement, or the Emergent Agreement, with Emergent Product Development Gaithersburg Inc., or Emergent, which we entered into in 2010. We granted Emergent an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license to use certain of our patents and related know how for the prevention or treatment of infection or illness caused by biodefense pathogens. We also granted a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to use certain of our patents and related know how for the prevention or treatment of tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fever indications. Both exclusive and non-exclusive licenses grants Emergent the opportunity to Exploit Licensed Products as defined in the Emergent Agreement in all of the countries of the world. There are currently no commercialized Exploit Licensed Products using this technology. 
         Emergent is obligated to pay us low single digit percentage royalties on net sales from their and their sublicensee's sale of any commercialized licensed product, and certain other payments. The aggregate milestone payments that we are entitled to pursuant to the Emergent Agreement are up to $2,750,000. 
         The term of the Emergent Agreement continues until expiration of all royalty obligations or until the agreement is earlier terminated. Emergent may terminate the agreement upon 60 days prior written notice. In addition, the Emergent Agreement terminates in the event the parties mutually agree to terminate the agreement. 
   Joint Venture 
   Joint Venture with Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. 
         We entered into a Joint Venture Contract, as amended, effective August 6, 2018, or the JV Agreement, with Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., a People's Republic of China company, or Hepalink, a related party and significant shareholder in the Company, pursuant to which we formed a Joint Venture company named Shenzen Arimab BioPharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or SABC, a People's Republic of China Company, to develop, manufacture, import and distribute AR-101, AR-301 and AR-105 in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, collectively, referred to as the Territory. The Joint Venture received regulatory approval in China and SABC was formed on July 2, 2018. 
         Hepalink is obligated to contribute the equivalent of $7.2 million in renminbi, the official currency of the People's Republic of China, and owns 51% of the capital of SABC and we are required to contribute (i) $1.0 million in cash and (ii) a license to AR-101, AR-301 and AR-105 pursuant to an Amended and Restated Technology License and Collaboration Agreement between us and SABC and we own 49% of the capital of SABC. In addition, Hepalink will provide SABC with clinical and regulatory personnel services for clinical and regulatory review, application and filing procedures in the Territory and we will provide clinical and regulatory personnel services to assist in coordination of the execution of the clinical study in China and also with CMC personnel services for drug supply and manufacturing planning Hepalink is obligated to make an additional equity investment of $10.8 million into SABC in connection with a future financing of SABC provided that (i) such financing does not occur earlier than January 1, 2019, (ii) top-line clinical results of the first global AR-301 phase III study are available, (iii) CFDA approval for a phase III clinical trial in China is granted, (iv) we have not breached the Amended and Restated Technology License and Collaboration Agreement and (v) the SABC Board has approved such financing. If and to the extent these milestone events occur and Hepalink contributes additional capital to SABC, our 49% ownership stake in SABC will be diminished in proportion to such investment. 
 39

           The Board of Directors of SABC shall consist of five directors, of which Hepalink shall appoint three members and we shall appoint 2 members. The term of office for each director shall be for four years. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of SABC will be approved by unanimous consent of the Board of Directors of SABC. The term of SABC shall be 20 years from the date of formation. 
         The JV Agreement will terminate and SABC will be dissolved in the event that:
 

 The term expires and is not extended; 
 The parties decide to terminate the JV Agreement; 
 A party fails to contribute funds for the capital it subscribed for and such failure exceeds six months; 
 A party is involved in liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings unless the remaining party agrees not to terminate; 
 A party fails to obtain approval of a resolution requiring the unanimous vote of the Board and such party notifies the other party that such
failure will materially adversely affect SABC and cannot be resolved; 
 A force majeure event prevails for a period in excess of six months; 
 A breach of the agreement occurs and has not been cured in 60 days; or 
 Either we or SABC terminates the Technology License and Collaboration Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

 Collaboration Agreements 
   Collaboration Agreement with GlaxoSmithKline 
         We entered into a collaborative and option agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A., or GSK, aimed at evaluating improved formulations for a rotavirus vaccine. The original collaborative work scope is now successfully completed. GSK had until at least January 2019 to exercise its option to negotiate certain licenses wherein GSK would have licensed certain of our patents and related know how relating to rotavirus in order to research, develop, market and commercialize a rotavirus vaccine. On January 28, 2019, GSK notified us that they would not be exercising its option. 
 Government Regulation 
         We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, among others. 
         The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time-consuming. 
   FDA Approval Process 
         In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and 
 40

   import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologic license applications, or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
         Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
         Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
         A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
         The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
         Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, but the Phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational drug candidate into healthy human subjects or patients, the investigational drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers. 
         If an investigational drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical 
 41

   trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide adequate information for its labeling. 
         After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or, in the case of a biologic, a BLA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. 
         The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within ten months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
         Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA or, in the case of a biologic, the BLA unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the marketing application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the product is safe and effective in the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA's general biological product standards. 
         After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, the FDA will re-initiate review. If the FDA is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the agency will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a complete response letter because it believes that the drug product is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. 
         An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug product's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product's potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
   Orphan Drug Act in the United States 
         The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory 
 42

   review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the U.S. during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 
         QIDP Designation is awarded to antibacterial or antifungal product candidates for human use that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections caused by certain bacterial or fungal pathogens that are deemed to be a particular threat to public health. QIDP designated products have a five-year market exclusivity extension and receive priority review for the first application submitted for product approval. 
   Orphan Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union 
         Products authorized as "orphan medicinal products" in the EU are entitled to certain exclusivity benefits. In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
         An application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
         Products authorized in the EU as orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:
 

 The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is
safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application;
or 
 The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 

 Other Regulatory Requirements 
         Once a NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of therapeutic products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. 
 43

           Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. We cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approval for our product candidates for any other indications or any other product candidate for any indication on a timely basis, if at all. 
         Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
   Companion Diagnostic Review and Approval 
         Some of our product candidates currently rely upon the use of a companion microbial diagnostic test to select patients who are infected with either S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, or A. baumannii bacteria and in the future, we may utilize other biomarkers as companion diagnostic tests for our other product candidates. Approval of our product candidates may require FDA approval of a Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, for a reproducible, validated diagnostic test to be used with our mAb product candidates. 
         The PMA process is costly, lengthy, and uncertain, although the PMA review for the microbial tests is not currently planned to occur concurrently with the development and review of a BLA for our product candidates. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the receipt and timing of commercial approval for our product candidates. Human diagnostic products are subject to pervasive and ongoing regulatory obligations, including the submission of medical device reports, adherence to the Quality Systems Regulation, recordkeeping and product labeling, as enforced by the FDA and comparable state authorities. 
   U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
         The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 
 44

     Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
         Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug and biologic product candidates which obtain marketing approval. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical manufacturers are exposed, directly, or indirectly, through customers, to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which a pharmaceutical manufacturer can market, sell and distribute drug and biologic products. These laws include, but are not limited to: 
         The federal Anti-Kickback Statute which prohibits, any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in-kind, to induce or reward either the referring of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federally financed healthcare program. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
         The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. As a result of a modification made by the Federal Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with certain expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company's marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. 
         The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, benefits, items or services. 
 45

           HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
         The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the "Physician Payments Sunshine Act," and its implementing regulations, which require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
         State and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 
         State laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts. 
         Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. 
         Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer's ability to operate its business and the results of its operations. 
 46

          
  Healthcare Reform in the United States 
         In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to the healthcare system that could affect the future results of pharmaceutical manufactures' operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Most recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, was enacted in March 2010, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following:


 an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned
among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 implementation of the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the "Physician Payments Sunshine Act"; 
 a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; 
 a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research,
along with funding for such research; 
 establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment
and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; 
 an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average
manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP; 
 a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics,
including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care
organizations; 
 expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional
individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate
liability; 
 a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing
January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's
outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program. 

         Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax 
 47

   Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate." Additionally, on January 22, 2018, Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole". More recently, in July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA. 
         Many of the details regarding the implementation of the PPACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, the full effect that the PPACA would have on a pharmaceutical manufacturer remains unclear. In particular, there is uncertainty surrounding the applicability of the biosimilars provisions under the PPACA. The FDA has issued several guidance documents, and withdrew others, but no implementing regulations on biosimilars have been adopted. A number of biosimilar applications have been approved over the past few years. The regulations that are ultimately promulgated and their implementation are likely to have considerable impact on the way pharmaceutical manufacturers conduct their business and may require changes to current strategies. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an approved drug notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the approved drug in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. 
         Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a "Blueprint" to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. Although a number of these, and other potential, proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer's business, results of operations, financial 
 48

   condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce ultimate demand for certain products or put pressure product pricing, which could negatively affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
         Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 ("Right to Try Act") was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under an FDA expanded access program. 
         In addition, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription drugs and biologics and the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While no one cannot predict the full outcome of any such legislation, it may result in decreased reimbursement for drugs and biologics, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce prescription drug prices. This could harm a pharmaceutical manufacturer's ability to generate revenue. Increases in importation or re-importation of pharmaceutical products from foreign countries into the United States could put competitive pressure on a pharmaceutical manufacturer's ability to profitably price products, which, in turn, could adversely affect business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. A pharmaceutical manufacturer might elect not to seek approval for or market products in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize the risk of re-importation, which could also reduce the revenue generated from product sales. It is also possible that other legislative proposals having similar effects will be adopted. 
         Furthermore, regulatory authorities' assessment of the data and results required to demonstrate safety and efficacy can change over time and can be affected by many factors, such as the emergence of new information, including on other products, changing policies and agency funding, staffing and leadership. No one can be sure whether future changes to the regulatory environment will be favorable or unfavorable to business prospects. For example, average review times at the FDA for marketing approval applications can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. 
   Regulation in the European Union 
         Biologics are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the U.S. In the EU, for example, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of a product in all countries of the EU, which includes most major countries in Europe. If this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the EU under two simplified application processes, the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After receiving regulatory approval through any of the European registration procedures, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. 
   Other Regulations 
         We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

     Reimbursement 
         Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that can require the provision of supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of drug or biologic products to the payor. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers operating costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of product from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. 
         There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. It is difficult to predict what third party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for new drug and biologic product candidates. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products could have a material adverse effect on a pharmaceutical manufacturer's operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and overall financial condition. 
         Reimbursement may impact the demand for, and/or the price of, any product which obtains marketing approval. Even if coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. 
         The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 
         In addition, it is expected that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities will continue and place further pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products that gain regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
