Relationship with Vornado - continued
As of December 31, 2018, Vornado owned 32.4% of our outstanding common stock.  Steven Roth is the Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties (“Interstate”), a New Jersey general partnership, and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado.  As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Roth, Interstate and its other two general partners, David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. (who are also directors of the Company and trustees of Vornado) owned, in the aggregate, 26.2% of our outstanding common stock, in addition to the 2.3% they indirectly own through Vornado.

Significant Tenant
Bloomberg accounted for revenue of $107,356,000, $105,224,000 and $104,590,000 in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 46% of our total revenues in each year.  No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.  If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg’s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg.  In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment.  All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area.  We compete with a large number of property owners and developers.  Principal factors of competition are the amount of rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided.  Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease or sell our properties, at profitable levels.  Our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms as it comes due.
Employees
We currently have 70 employees.

Executive Office
Our executive office is located at 210 Route 4 East, Paramus, New Jersey, 07652 and our telephone number is (201) 587-8541.

Available Information
Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as well as Reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 regarding officers, directors, and 10% beneficial owners filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are available free of charge on our website (www.alx-inc.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Also available on our website are copies of our Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines.  In the event of any changes to these items, revised copies will be made available on our website.  Copies of these documents are also available directly from us, free of charge. 

In May 2009, Vornado and Interstate each filed with the SEC an amendment to their respective Schedule 13D indicating that they, as a group, own 47.2% of our common stock.  This ownership level, together with the shares owned by Messrs. Roth, Mandelbaum and Wight, makes us a “controlled” company for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.’s Corporate Governance Standards (the “NYSE Rules”).  This means that we are not required to, among other things, have a majority of the members of our Board of Directors be independent under the NYSE Rules, have all of the members of our Compensation Committee be independent under the NYSE Rules or to have a Nominating Committee.  While we have voluntarily complied with a majority of the independence requirements of the NYSE Rules, we are under no obligation to do so and this situation may change at any time.
