ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General Development of Business
 
The Company was organized in the State of Nevada on April 24, 2008 under the name Planet Resources, Corp. The Company’s initial business model was the re-processing of mine tailings from previous mining operations. We did not generate any revenues because we were not successful in implementing our business plan. Various business alternatives were considered to ensure the viability and solvency of the Company; however, the Company went dormant from April 30, 2011 to June 2018, and in Case Number A-14-720990-C, Nevada's 8th Judicial District appointed Robert Stevens as Receiver for the Company on August 20, 2015. Subsequent to Mr. Stevens being released as the court-appointed receiver in July 2018, the Company embarked on its new business plan.


On December 20, 2018, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) in the cell-extraction sector with Cell Science Holdings Ltd. (“Licensor”). Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Licensor granted to the Company an exclusive license, with respect to the Licensed Science and process, for, among other things, the production, manufacturing and sale of cannabis and byproducts thereof where permitted within the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, all countries in the Caribbean Sea and all other countries north of the Panama/Columbia border, including the entire nation of Panama (the “Territory”).
 
We currently conduct our business activities at our offices at One World Trade Center, Suite 130, Long Beach, California 90831.


Our common stock is currently trading on the OTC Markets Pinksheets under the symbol BKUH.
 
Financial Information
 
The audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 are attached hereto as Item 8 in this annual report.
 
Business of Issuer
 
On December 20, 2018, the Company entered into a License Agreement in the cell-extraction sector. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Licensor granted to the Company an exclusive license, with respect to the use of the Licensed Science and process, for (i) the production, manufacturing and sale of cannabis and byproducts thereof where permitted, (ii) Cannabis-related research, teaching and education for both medical and other purposes, and (iii) all medical uses and applications of Cannabis, within the Territory, as defined in the License Agreement.
 
The Company business plan is to sublicense the rights acquired under the License Agreement to third parties in various market verticals for an initial payment and an ongoing royalty stream.
 
The value of the potential licenses will be dependent on the ability for third parties to scale the application of the technology and trade secret processes in production laboratories at the same or lesser capital costs and operating costs than approaches common to the industry verticals for CBD and or THC concentrate.
 
For commercial and licensing purposes, which is the basis the License Agreement, in simplistic terms, the Licensor has represented to the Company that the Licensed Science and processes may be utilized to dissect a specific cell (the “Donor Cell”) of a cannabis donor plant that has a measurable percentage level of Tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) and Cannabidiol (“CBD”), and using the Licensed Science and process, 
 thereafter grow duplicate cells in a laboratory commercial application so that each 5000 liter grow process will produce approximately 90 kilos or approximately 187 pounds of cells containing identical measurable percentage levels of THC and CBD.

Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company and Licensor have agreed that a commercial scaled demonstration of the Licensed Science (the “Efficacy Testing”) is necessary to validate the representations and claims of Licensor, to establish the value of License Agreement. The standard result (the “Standard Result”) claim by the Licensor and which will be considered acceptable by the Company is a result in which (a) the cells produced, harvested and dried during a full cycle of the Licensed Science process contain at least 90% of the measurable percentage levels of THC and CBG as the Donor Cell, and (b) this result is achieved at a project utility, production and supplies cost of $0.10 per gram or roughly $100 per kilo.
 
To date, our efforts have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities, which include developing our business plan and finalizing the License Agreement with the Licensor and developing a method to market and sublicense the rights granted under said License Agreement. With the intent of, and in furtherance of engaging in the sublicense of the rights granted under the License Agreement, the Company has, and continues to (i) monitor the required Efficacy Testing being conducted under the License Agreement; (ii) research and define, with the assistance of Licensor, the equipment and staffing requirements to scale the technology process to a commercial scale operation, (iii) explore with experts and companies in the cannabis industry the current costs to cultivate and process end products with either a THC or CBD concentrate, and (v) research the regulatory requirements in the Territory as they pertain to the ability to sublicense the rights of the Company under the License Agreement.
 
The Company is currently preparing for Efficacy Testing to validate the License Science and processes in a scientific laboratory setting, prove-up the efficiencies and scalability of the grow process, to evaluate and determine the market value of the process and then enter into sublicenses for cash consideration and royalty payments.
 
Subsidiary - Cell Science CBD International, Inc.
 
On August 9, 2019, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Cell Science CBD International, Inc., a California corporation (“CS CBD”). The Company formed CS CBD with the specific intent of separating the business operations and opportunities relating to THC which sub-licensing shall be conducted through the Company, from the business operations and opportunities relating to CBD which will be conducted through CS CBD. In this regard, the Company is in the process of facilitating the sublicensing of all rights under the License Agreement that pertain to CBD, including without limitation utilizing the Licensed Science and the process as it applies to CBD, and the subsequent grant of sublicenses to third parties that are legally engaged in the business of producing and manufacturing CBD derived products and byproducts for sale and use where permitted. The Company intends that any additional licenses acquired by the Company that pertains to CBD will also be sublicensed to CS CBD.
Licensor’s Approach.
 
In laymen’s terms, the Licensor’s approach is as follow:
 
Rather than producing a pound of end product of with predictable measurable percentage level of THC and or CBD by growing plants that produce flowers that are then either ground or distilled using solvents to get the concentrate of cells which have THC and or CBD, the Licensor’s approach is to select a targeted Donor Cell from a donor plant that has all the characteristics desired in the end concentrate product and harvest that specific cell (“Donor Cell”). That Donor Cell is then duplicated in a clean lab environment to millions of cells which becomes a “Seed Culture” batch of desired cells contained in a ten or twenty liter proprietary container. That batch of “seed culture” cells is then added to a proprietary medium culture in a larger proprietary container generically referred to as a “Bioreactor,” sized at 1,000 liters. The bioreactor is then operated for 40 to 42 days inside a proprietary “pod” environment, in which light, oxygen, CO2, and other factors are controlled. At the end of the growth cycle, the medium culture and the multiplied cells are “harvested,” and the raw product is put through two proprietary finishing processes which removes moisture and unwanted cells. The end product, a dry concentrate, can then be sized in powder grind size for various uses, including those in the medical or food industry, according to set specifications. The end product has the exact identity of the Donor Cell, in terms of THC and CBD as well as the other attributes of the Donor Cell.


The general efficiencies of cell growth process using the Licensed Science are that it can produce the active ingredient from the host organic substance, specifically the Donor Cell, in mandated quantities while assuring purity levels and concentrations as opposed to the inconsistencies and waste found in the cultivation, harvest, processing, storage, packaging, shipping, and limited shelf-life of typical cannabis plant cultivation and processing.

Products and Services
 
The Company does not produce any products and has no current intent on engaging in the cultivation, production, manufacturing or sale of cannabis derived products.
 
Rather, if the Licensed Science is proven and validated, the Company intends to undertake the sublicense of the Licensed Science to such third parties, consistent with the terms of the License Agreement, that are legally engaged in the business of producing and manufacturing cannabis derived products and byproducts for sale and use where permitted, including, a cannabis concentrate powder product for the medical, food additive, and recreational cannabis consumption market verticals.
 
If validated and scalable as claimed by the Licensor, the Company believes that an end user (i.e. third parties and companies legally engaged in the cultivation, production, manufacturing or sale of cannabis derived products) would value and prefer this method (using the Licensed Science and process) to produce an end product concentrate, with identifiable consistent quality at a reduced cost. The potential for reduced capital expense, reduced costs to grow and harvest, reduced labor, reduced testing costs, and importantly, the avoidance of contaminants, pests, blights, and varied “flower” harvests, common to the current industry approaches in inside grow and greenhouse outdoor grow operations, are compelling reasons for using the Licensed Science and process.
 
To conduct the Efficacy Testing required under the License Agreement and establish the business and science ratios for the production of the end product, the OZ Corporation on behalf of the Licensor has engaged and is working with V O Leasing Corp., to build a 5,600 square foot research and development lab in Van Nuys, California (the “Van Nuys Lab”). V O Leasing Corp., holds provisional California issued Cannabis Cultivation, Manufacturing and Distribution licenses that become full licenses with the completion of the renovation of the Van Nuys lab and final inspection by the regulatory committee. V O leasing Corp has experience in, and is a respected consultant to, the cannabis industry, and in addition to the provisional licenses in Van Nuys, holds a cannabis cultivation and processing licenses in Chatsworth and Hollywood, California, and has created their own brand of cannabis products which are currently carried in over 600 dispensaries including MedMen dispensaries, and are currently expanding their operations and brand to other states. In addition to assisting with the licensed and regulatory compliance pertaining to the Efficacy Testing of the Licensed Science and process, VO Leasing Corp., with the consent of the Company as the license holder, has the option to utilize concentrate produced as part of the Efficacy Testing from the Van Nuys lab, in V O Leasing’s medical and recreational consumables after third party certification of the Efficacy Test results of the Licensed Science and certification that the product concentrate meets the California cannabis regulatory quality testing.


The Van Nuys Lab will attempt to replicate, utilizing ten 1,000-liter bioreactors, the previous laboratory tests and results of the technology and processes that were conducted in one-liter test runs and memorialize the projected cost of goods ratios for production of the concentrate. The business objective is to verify that the Licensed Science and the process can produce a desired concentrate at or below current competitive market approaches.
 
Permitting, design, and engineering work began in March of 2019, and the Van Nuys Lab is expected to be operational by end of November of 2019. The first scaled Efficacy Test, scheduled to begin in December of 2019, will utilize ten 1,000-liter bioreactors (approximately 260 US gallons in each reactor) and three differing original seed cultures (targeted seed cells from three different donor plants). Licensor has advised the Company that it anticipates that the first scaled production Efficacy Test will be completed in late January or February 2020, at which time the results will be sent to an accredited third-party lab for verification of purity, potency, and compliance with California cannabis and CBD regulations. Assuming the Licensed Science process is successful and verified through both the Efficacy Test and third-party verification, the Company will begin seeking to enter into sublicense agreements.


The Company intends to sublicense its rights under the License Agreement to financially qualified and appropriately licensed third-party cannabis companies that will either build their own commercial production laboratories, or convert existing laboratories to utilize the Licensed Science process and production approach. The potential licensees must be qualified by possessing both the regulatory licensure, as well as the financial capability to acquire a sublicense to the License Science and finance a 12,000 square foot production lab.
 
Thus, the Company plans to only be burdened with research and development costs, and creating a licensing sales and support operation, without the attendant operational expenses of building production facilities, acquiring compliant cannabis licensing in various states and provinces, or bringing products to the marketplace.

Support Services to Sublicensees 
 
The Company’s business model is to create a licensing program, including marketing, sales, business and technical support to sublicensees to help the sublicensees permit and build a commercial production laboratory utilizing the Company’s proprietary production processes, proprietary concentrate finishing process and the Company’s proprietary equipment and process designs and medium culture formulations.
 
The Company and the Licensor have created proprietary equipment designs necessary to the cell production process and the product finishing process, all of which are in process of being filed as Intellectual Property. Additionally the Company has proprietary formulations for the medium growing culture which will be sold at cost to the Licensees.
 
In support of the sublicensees, the Company will provided advisory consulting services, as required, with regard to:

In August 2018, the Licensor completed third-party lab test through Evio Labs-Berkley (C3 Labs, LLC), a subsidiary of Evio Inc., in Berkley, California confirming the efficacy of cells grown in petri dishes using the Licensed Science. Specifically, Evio labs tested and confirmed that the THC and CBD potency of the concentrate produced by the Licensed Science process matching the THC and CBD potency of the donor plant.
 
One of the inventors, Dr. Peter Whitton, completed in house efficacy testing of a research laboratory simulation of the proprietary filtering and drying process in July of 2019 in Van Nuys, California. These tests, conducted in a VO Leasing “clean lab,” by Dr. Whitton, confirmed the type of filtration process required to identify and separate the targeted production cells, and, the size of the filtration membranes, at the planned 1000 liter bioreactor product scale, to be utilized in the proposed lab scaling efficacy tests. Additionally, Dr. Whitton was able to use the same experiments to determine the drying process and rightly size the drying ovens and the moisture ratios of the cell concentrate product before and after filtering.

As stated above, as part of the Efficacy Testing requirements under the License Agreement, the OZ Corporation on behalf of the Licensor, has contracted to build and operate a 5,600 square foot research and development lab in Van Nuys, California, under a State of California issued Cannabis Cultivation and Manufacturing license, held by VO Leasing Corp. The Company expects the Van Nuys Lab to be completed and the Efficacy Test, directed by Dr. Whitton, to begin in December 2019 or January 2020. The first test cycle will take approximately six (6) weeks from initial loading of the Seed Culture into the proprietary medium culture in the Bioreactors, until the batch of desired cells is mature for harvest, filtering and drying.


The only business of the Company will be the sub-licensing of the Licensed Science. The rights under the License Agreement are perpetual, contingent on the Company staying in compliance on terms of the License Agreement and the potential sublicensees being in compliance with the terms of any sublicense agreements.

The protection of proprietary rights relating to Licensed Science is critical for the business. The Company intends to file additional patent applications to protect certain technology and improvements considered important to the development of the Company’s business. The Company, through its subsidiary, further intends to license the rights under a recently filed patent application with regard to patent rights to produce a non-toxic CBD product and thereafter to specifically grant sublicenses to utilize the process for CBD based products as opposed to THC products. The Company also intends to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position.

Although the Company intends to seek patent protection for additionally developed proprietary technology, the patent positions of our products are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the patent applications that we have and will consider filing will result in the issuance of any patents or whether such patent applications will be circumvented or invalidated. There can be no assurance that all United States patents that may pose a risk of infringement can or will be identified. If we are unable to obtain licenses where we may have infringed on other patents, we could encounter delays in market introductions while attempting to design around such intellectual property rights, or we could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be prevented. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us on such intellectual property rights or prosecuting suits which the Company brings against other parties to protect its intellectual property rights. Competitors or potential competitors may have filed applications for, or have received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to, compounds or processes competitive with those of covered under the License Agreement.


The Company relies on the patented and unpatented trade secrets under the License Agreement its business, and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that the Company can meaningfully protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets. We intend to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements either upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with the Company or at a later time. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for the Licensed Science utilized by the Company or trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
We do not believe that any of our patents or other proprietary rights infringe upon the rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that others may not assert infringement claims against the Licensor or the Company in the future and we recognize that any such assertion may require us to incur legal and other defense costs, enter into compromise royalty arrangements, or terminate the use of some technologies. Further, we may be required to incur legal and other costs to protect our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties.


Additional Intellectual Property and Processes in Development
 
Early testing of the proprietary technology and trade secret process claimed in the Licensor’s subsequent process patent application filed on October 11, 2019 indicates that CBD produced cells in a concentrate from the Licensed Science proprietary process hold promise, when treated in a secondary process defined in the patent filing, to avoid the potential harmful toxicity side effects to liver and kidney that have recently emerged in consumers that ingest or apply topically, CBD products. This toxicity results from the current industry wide lab approach to refining and producing CBD distillate oils which are then utilized in numerous unregulated products experiencing a rapid growth for health and diet consumption of humans and animals
 
In this regard, the Licensor is currently undertaking to enter into an agreement to have an FDA accredited lab conduct a series of tests utilizing the Licensed Science for creating a CBD product versus products from multiple current suppliers.
 
The intended first FDA reviewed test protocol will focus on the safety issues of CBD product processing and distillation that is known to cause initial and cumulative toxicity in the human and animal liver. The test protocol will require liver cells from multiple single donors from accredited lab sources for a comparative test impact analysis of the current market offerings vis a vis the Licensed Science approach to making a CBD concentrate.
 

10
--

Lab testing will measure the initial and cumulative toxicity impact on human liver cells of each of at least six commercial public CBD selected suppliers, and then compare, utilizing the same protocols, the impact on the liver cells utilizing the product created using the Licensed Science and treated using the proprietary process.


The first multi-purpose test will seek to demonstrate, utilizing human liver tissue, the impact of consuming or applying topically, CBD products that are sourced from CBD high concentrate distillate, in the doses and frequencies, proposed by the various manufacturers of topical or consumable products, to create immediate and cumulative toxicity in the liver of humans.
 
In the same test protocols, the CBD product utilizing the licensed process will be tested on human liver cells demonstrating that the licensed process created CBD concentrate will have limited or zero initial and or cumulative toxicity in the same source liver cells utilized in the tests. The Company intends to begin the first FDA reviewed test in November of 2019 for current CBD manufactured products, whether topical or consumable, creating human liver cell toxicity.
 
Pursuant to Efficacy Testing of the commercial scaling of the process using the Licensed Science, the Licensor intends to seek a full FDA approval of its commercially scaled production process to yield a concentrate product that may be utilized, by food or Pharmaceutical companies, as directed, in topicals and consumables that will not create toxicity in the liver. The Company currently intends to enter those FDA trials in February or March of 2020 utilizing the same test protocols already utilized by the FDA in the first FDA review planned for November of 2019. The Company believes the receipt of FDA approval by the Licensor would enhance value and credibility of the Licensed Science under the License Agreement held by the Company.


The Company does not intend to seek FDA approval to create or license derivative products of its CBD concentrate, nor to focus on specific use cases or claims medically for using CBD. Rather it seeks to demonstrate, in the affirmative, that the CBD concentrate that is created by its patented pending process will not cause toxicity in the liver of humans or animals if consumed or utilized in topicals to deliver CBD.
 
The Company believes that the opioid health crisis creates the necessity of substitutes for opioid based products which may potentially be sourced from Sativa Cannabis derivatives. The Company believes that an FDA published recognition from their sponsored testing protocols that the Company process and methodology for producing a CBD concentrate that does not create toxicity in the liver will remove one more “roadblock” from other companies offering topical and consumable cannabis based alternatives to opioid offerings based on CBD source products and could add significant value to the Company’s rights under the License Agreement.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company does not utilize any raw materials as the Company does not produce any products and has no current intent on engaging in the cultivation, production, manufacturing or sale of cannabis derived products. There are various materials required when using the Licensed Science processes, all of which are readily available. Provided that a sublicensee possesses the proper required licenses which differs from state to state, including without limitation, by way of example in California, a Cannabis Cultivation and Manufacturing license, the Company is not aware of any existing or future problem that will materially affect the source and availability of any materials which would be required of a sublicenses of the Licensed Science.
Sublicenses and Royalty Agreements
 
To date we have not entered into any sublicense or royalty agreements which have resulted in royalty payments.
 
Market
 
According to the Brightfield Group, the global medical cannabis market is expected to grow from its current 7.7 billion dollars to 31.4 billion by 2021. The US market currently drives 90 percent of global cannabis sales, but with Canada and other western nations reassessing medical cannabis, the US percentage of the market share is expected to decrease to below 60%. Decreased government regulation, and the lack of political will to enforce federal cannabis laws also plays an important role in the growth and expansion of the cannabis industry as a whole. We believe that the Company’s development plan will allow us to build the relationships, experience, resources and services to be successful in sub-licensing the Licensed Science in the medical cannabis industry, the CBD industry, and provide net stockholder value through the initial license fees, as well as royalty earnings.

The Company intends to sublicense to both public and private companies in the medical cannabis, the recreational cannabis (where permitted) and those companies that are choosing to focus on CBD market for topicals, and edibles, and to stay out of THC content above 3% market.
 
The Company believes that the recent focused interest of the FDA on safety issues for medical, recreational and topical applications of all cannabis-based products will only intensify. Further, the Company believes that the patents filed by inventors/scientists and possessed by the Licensor will protect for many years, others attempting to duplicate the approach using the Licensed Science, to creating a predictable quality cannabis concentrate. It should be noted however, that any FDA approval of medical cannabis and cannabis related products contain THC and CBD, may come with FDA restrictions and regulations that could affect the Licensed Science.
 
The Company believes that the potential medical and food-based inclusion of pure grade cannabis products, as well as providing product for the CBD rapidly expanding markets has potential to drive adoption of Licensed Science.
 
Distribution Plan
 
The Company’s near-term plan, upon validation and certification of the Efficacy Testing, scalability and costs using the Licensed Science, which the Company anticipates being completed in the first or second quarter of 2020, is to begin qualifying candidates which will sublicense the Licensed Science to produce concentrate products for medical and recreational markets via cell growth technology in multiple bioreactor facilities.
 
Cell growth in research applications and commercial bioreactor labs has achieved efficacy in recent years in terms of operational viability. While the technology works, the economics for certain applications, outside of a science experiment, have not proven to be economically feasible. The Company believes cell culturing is commercially viable if growing highly valued, and relatively difficult to find in nature, certain plant or animal cells that are utilized in medicine and food additive products to add viability to the host product. A cost to grow targeted cells of $200 to $2,000 per pound is economically viable when you are selling the product by the gram or for extremely high multiples.
 
Applications of the science for tissue and or cell culturing for the cannabis industry has been hampered by the federal mandate of cannabis containing more than 3% THC to be a controlled substance. As the minimum investment is several million dollars for a commercially scaled laboratory, and those assets are all subject to seizure under federal law, most finance sources were not willing to advance the funds for experimentation. Additionally, a cannabis plant, at the cell and molecular level has attributes that make it very difficult, if not impossible, to utilize “big Ag” bioreactor (bioreactors sized from 3,000 gallon to 500 cubic meters (130,000 gallon) science to grow the cells. All experiments known to the inventors to date, of applied bio science protocols by third parties to grow THC and CBD products in traditional bioscience approaches, have failed to produce a predictable cannabis end product that mirrors the subject donor plant.


One of the reasons the Licensor has secured its first patent on the Licensed Science proprietary process is that its process has actually worked, utilizing a “bioreactor” science approach, but with a proprietary bioreactor design, a differing proprietary environmental control which was not achieved with traditional (dark or limited light) bioreactor commercial offerings and proprietary medium culture formulations. And, importantly, the final filtering process, also of proprietary design, is able to separate the desired cells without damaging or destroying them. The Licensed Science is a holistic approach that begins with the idea that you can grow cells but requires all the processes and equipment to be specifically and uniquely designed for the targeted cannabis cell.
 
According to trade journals, business news following the cannabis industry worldwide, and public company information available for Canadian companies and US companies domiciling in Canada, the cost, average, reported by the industry, of both private and public companies to grow cannabis flower and trim in an inside grow facility in California is approximately $800 to $950 a pound without capital expenses or taxes and approximately $420 a pound in a typical California greenhouse grow. The end product flower, before taxation, depending on the state and the strain, is selling for between $1,200 a pound to over $4,000 a pound.


The Company believes that the combination of the Licensed Science and process holds promise to deliver a high-quality cell culture concentrate at costs below $250 per pound in a commercially scaled laboratory that is one third the cap ex cost of a greenhouse grow facility.
 
The Company plans to sublicense the Licensed Science process to third parties who have the requisite licenses and financial ability to scale-up commercially sized bioreactor labs capable of producing 60,000 pounds per annum of a predictable harvested cell product with reliable qualities and quantities in the product at lower costs per pound to deliver than any current market alternative.

Sales and Marketing
 
The Company’s plan is offer to sublicense the Licensed Science to qualified cannabis licensed operators in those states with the US in which the Licensed Science may legally be used as well as all the provinces of Canada, specifically limiting the number of licenses in a given market for cannabis THC based products. The number of sublicenses to be sold will depend on size of potential market in that specific state, estimated future consumption of products in that market, and whether the state is medical consumption only, or both, medical and recreational. Additionally, the Company, through its subsidiary CS CBD, plans to sublicense the Licensed Science, with regard to CBD based products, to qualified licensed operators in those states within the United States, and all the provinces of Canada, in which the Licensed Science may legally be used or where national or international trade agreements currently in place allow the cross border trade of CBD concentrate or CBD based products.
Competition
 
The Company believes the Licensed Science, requiring less capitalization than inside grow or outside grow without the attendant challenges of such operations, and delivering a competitive product at a lower cost per pound, will drive adoption by sublicenses in the market. The medical cannabis industry in the United States is highly competitive. Our prospective licensees face competition from traditional cultivation and processing facilities already with market share. Additionally, there are many public and private companies with large cash reserves waiting to enter the market when the regulations change. In the states where cannabis is legal, others have enjoyed a first mover advantage. Past spending on traditional grow methods may limit sublicensing opportunities, which could create a significant barrier to entry in the medical cannabis and recreational cannabis market. We will compete with a variety of companies, many of which have substantially greater technical, financial, marketing and other resources than we do, allowing them to compete more effectively than we can.


The Company considers anyone that is engaged in the business of producing THC and CBD by growing plants and extracting the THC and CBD from the plant to be a competitor. MedMen and Curaleaf, for example, have first mover advantage. Medmen, headquartered in Culver City, California is engaged in the Clone-to-Product cannabis business with operations for cultivation and retail paired up in California and eight other US states. Curaleaf, a Connecticut company, backed by Blackstone Partners and other investors, is the third largest cultivator and dispensary owner in the US market. It recently acquired Grass Roots for US$875 million and Cura Partners for over $1 billion. These companies have been in the market for many years and have significant resources and market share. However, assuming successful results from the Efficacy Testing and third party certification of the Licensed Science, it is believed that products can be produced using the Licensed Science at significant cost saving, making adoption of the Licensed Science attractive. The Company has initiated conversations with executives at Med Men about potentially licensing the Licensed Science after efficacy testing.


Dependence on few/many customers
 
The Company has no current customers and intends to limit the number of sublicenses in a given market for cannabis THC based products. However, the company will determine, after completion of the Efficacy Test and certification, if the Licensed Science can be optimized by selling hundreds of licenses or limiting the number of sublicenses to certain large producers and distributors.
 
The Company intends to focus on potential sub-licensees that have the financial wherewithal to pay an initial license fee of $500,000 or more, have the ability to build out a lab with an estimated cost of $5.5 million, and will sign a guaranteed royalty agreement beginning within six months of operational start-up. We believe that this is the starting point, but we have not sold the first license. In contrast, to produce what can be produced in a 12,000 square feet lab using the Licensed Science at an estimated capital cost of $5.5 million, it is estimated that it would cost over $12 million to build a 280,000 square foot greenhouse grow, an outdoor operation on at least ten acres, requiring labor, significant water and utility power, and suffer waste/loss on average of 15% to grow a third party lab tested pound of flower at around $425. We believe that an apples to apples comparison of capital expense, cost to grow, and risk mitigation utilized in the Licensed Science approach will attract operators and investors in this industry willing take this financial risk. Additionally, the Company believes those operators planning on expansion will have to evaluate the opportunity to license the Licensed Science from the Company before committing more expansion dollars to their traditional approaches to grow product for the projected growing demand of the cannabis market.

Government approvals and regulation in the United States Cannabis Industry
 
Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the “CSA”). Even in those jurisdictions in which the manufacture and use of medical cannabis has been legalized at the state level, the possession, use and cultivation all remain violations of federal law that are punishable by imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Moreover, individuals and entities may violate federal law if they intentionally aid and abet another in violating these federal controlled substance laws or conspire with another to violate them. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop. and Gonzales v. Raich that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize the sale, possession and use of cannabis, even for medical purposes. We would likely be unable to execute our business plan if the federal government were to strictly enforce federal law regarding cannabis, and the chemically active compounds contained within.
 
In January 2018, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) rescinded certain memoranda, including the so-called “Cole Memo” issued on August 29, 2013 under the Obama Administration, which had characterized enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions under the CSA to prosecute those complying with state regulatory systems allowing the use, manufacture and distribution of medical cannabis as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial resources when state regulatory and enforcement efforts are effective with respect to enumerated federal enforcement priorities under the CSA. The impact of the DOJ's rescission of the Cole Memo and related memoranda is unclear but may result in the DOJ increasing its enforcement actions against the state-regulated cannabis industry generally.
 
Congress previously enacted an omnibus spending bill that includes a provision prohibiting the DOJ (which includes the Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”)) from using funds appropriated by that bill to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. This provision, however, expired on December 7, 2018, and must be renewed by Congress. In USA vs. McIntosh, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds from relevant appropriations acts to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. However, the Ninth Circuit's opinion, which only applies to the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Idaho, also held that persons who do not strictly comply with all state laws and regulations regarding the distribution, possession and cultivation of medical-use cannabis have engaged in conduct that is unauthorized, and in such instances the DOJ may prosecute those individuals.
 
Additionally, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statutes and the Bank Secrecy Act. The penalties for violation of these laws include imprisonment, substantial fines and forfeiture. Prior to the DOJ's rescission of the “Cole Memo,” supplemental guidance from the DOJ issued under the Obama administration directed federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the “Cole Memo” when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. With the rescission of the “Cole Memo,” there is increased uncertainty and added risk that federal law enforcement authorities could seek to pursue money laundering charges against entities or individuals engaged in supporting the cannabis industry.
 
Federal prosecutors have significant discretion and no assurance can be given that the federal prosecutor in each judicial district where our sublicensees operate will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis or cannabis-related activities production or distribution. Any change in the federal government's enforcement posture with respect to state-licensed cultivation of cannabis or its chemical components, including the enforcement postures of individual federal prosecutors in judicial districts where our sublicensees operate, would result in our inability to execute our business plan, and we would likely suffer significant losses, which would adversely affect the trading price of our securities. We have not requested or obtained any opinion of counsel or ruling from any authority to determine if our operations are in compliance with or violate any state or federal laws or whether we are assisting others to violate a state or federal law. In the event that our operations are deemed to violate any laws or if we are deemed to be assisting others to violate a state or federal law, any resulting liability could cause us to modify or cease our operations.

Should the federal government legalize cannabis for medical use, it is possible that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") would seek to regulate it under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules and regulations including CGMPs (“Certified Good Manufacturing Practices) related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical cannabis. Clinical trials may be needed to verify efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where medical cannabis is grown be registered with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations. In the event that some or all of these regulations are imposed, we do not know what the impact would be on the cannabis industry and what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced. If our sublicensees are unable to comply with the regulations and/or registration as prescribed by the FDA, such sublicensees may be unable to continue to operate our business in the US markets.
 
Local and state marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our proposed business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
 
Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. Guidance issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen, a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Furthermore, supplemental guidance from the DOJ directs federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memo when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. Banks remain hesitant to offer banking services to cannabis-related businesses. Consequently, those businesses involved in the cannabis industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships. Our inability to maintain our current bank accounts would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical and security challenges and could result in our inability to implement our business plan.
 
The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by FinCEN, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000, including identification of the customer by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Employees
 
As of July 31, 2019, we had employees other than our Chief Executive Officer, Thomas K. Emmitt. We intend to hire additional personnel as we grow and develop our business. National unemployment rates remain low relative to historical averages, and there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the medical cannabis industry. Nevertheless, we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
