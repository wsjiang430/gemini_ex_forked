Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------



U.S. NeuroSurgical Holdings, Inc. owns and operates, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, stereotactic radiosurgery centers, utilizing gamma knife technology, and holds other interests in radiological treatment facilities.  As used herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “Company”, “Registrant” and “Holdings” means U.S. NeuroSurgical Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. NeuroSurgical, Inc. (“USN”), and the wholly-owned subsidiaries of USN, U.S. NeuroSurgical Physics, Inc. and USN Corona, Inc.
 
USN, a Delaware corporation, was formed in July 1993.  Until September 1999, USN was a wholly owned subsidiary of GHS, Inc. (“GHS”).  Effective  September 17, 1999, GHS distributed its shares of USN to the stockholders of GHS.
 
On September 3, 2015, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of September 3, 2015, by and among USN, Holdings and U.S. NeuroSurgical Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), the Company adopted a new holding company organizational structure whereby USN is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. This structure did not result in any changes to the assets or operations of the Company, but management believes that it will create a more flexible framework for possible future transactions and organizational and operational adjustments.
    The holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger (the “Merger”) conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), which provides for the formation of a holding company structure without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations.  Because the holding company organizational structure occurred at the parent company level, the remainder of the Company’s subsidiaries, operations and customers were not affected by this transaction.
    In order to effect the Merger, USN formed Holdings as its wholly owned subsidiary and Holdings formed Merger Sub as its wholly owned subsidiary.  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into USN, with USN surviving the merger and becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings.   Immediately prior to the Merger, Holdings had no assets, liabilities or operations.
    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all of the outstanding capital stock of USN was converted, on a share for share basis, into capital stock of Holdings.  As a result, each former stockholder of USN became the owner of an identical number of shares of capital stock of Holdings, evidencing the same proportional interests in Holdings and having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as those that the stockholder held in USN.
    Following the Merger, Holdings’ common stock continued to trade on the over-the-counter market and continued to be quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the same symbol, “USNU.”  The conversion of shares of capital stock under the Merger Agreement occurred without an exchange of physical certificates.  Accordingly, physical certificates formerly representing shares of outstanding capital stock of USN are deemed to represent the same number of shares of capital stock of Holdings.

 Table of Contents
Pursuant to Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdings are substantially identical to those of USN prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement took effect.  The authorized capital stock of Holdings, the designations, rights, powers and preferences of such capital stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof are also substantially identical to those of the capital stock of USN immediately prior to the date of the Merger.  Further, the directors and executive officers of Holdings are the same individuals who were directors and executive officers, respectively, of USN immediately prior to the date of the Merger.
 
The Company’s executive offices are located at 2400 Research Boulevard, Suite 325, Rockville, Maryland 20850, and its telephone number is (301) 208-8998.

General
 
The Company and its predecessors have owned and operated stereotactic radiosurgery centers, utilizing gamma knife technology since 1993. The Company currently holds an interest in and operates one gamma knife center on the premises of New York University Medical Center (“NYU”) in New York, New York.  In January 2009, the Company, through its noncontrolling interest in Corona Gamma Knife, LLC, participated in the opening of a new center, the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center, at the San Antonio Regional Hospital (“SARH”) in Upland, California.
 
Management continues to explore opportunities to organize and participate in additional gamma knife centers.  The Company’s business strategy is to provide cost-effective approaches that allow hospitals, physicians, and patients access to gamma knife treatment capability, a high capital cost item.  The Company provides the gamma knife to medical facilities on a “cost per treatment” basis.  The Company’s business model is to own, or hold an interest in, the gamma knife units, and charge the medical facility, where the unit is housed and maintained, based on utilization. During 2018, the Company’s arrangement with its only customer met the criteria for classification as a sales type lease, and the Company was deemed to have sold its sole gamma knife.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, USN Corona, Inc. (“USNC”), to carry investments in Corona Gamma Knife, LLC and NeuroPartners, LLC.  Those business units were formed to develop and manage the gamma knife center at SARH.

The Company’s principal target market is medical centers in major health care catchment areas that have physicians experienced with and dedicated to the use of the gamma knife.  As it has with the NYU and SARH gamma knife centers, if circumstances support the opening of additional centers, the Company would seek, through the formation of  a joint venture,  cooperative ventures with these facilities.
 
The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 120 gamma knife treatment centers in the U.S.
 
During 2010, through the formation of a joint venture, in which it has a noncontrolling interest, the Company expanded its market strategy to include opportunities to develop cancer centers featuring radiation therapy.  These centers utilize linear accelerators with IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy) and IGRT (Image Guided Radiation Therapy) capabilities.  In 2010, the Company formed Florida Oncology Partners, LLC (“FOP”) in partnership with local physicians and other investors.  USNC owns a 24% interest in the venture.  FOP’s first center was located in Miami, Florida and opened in the second quarter of 2011. The Company entered into an arrangement to sell this center to 21st Century Oncology in December of 2015.  The recognition of the sale had not occurred as of December 31, 2018.
 
In 2015, Medical Oncology Partners LLC (“MOP”), was formed in partnership with local physicians and other investors. MOP was established to acquire a 100% equity interest in United Oncology Medical Associates of Florida, LLC (“UOMA”) USNC was not initially a member of MOP as it was legally not able to participate due to the fact that USNC was not a physician. Paperwork was filed for a waiver and on December 22, 2016, USNC was cleared to become a part owner of MOP. USNC currently owns 35.83% of MOP.
 
Late in 2016, FOP took initial steps toward the development of a new radiation therapy center in Homestead, Florida.  However, late in the third quarter of 2017, it was determined that the business opportunity at this new location should be pursued by a different investor group, and FOP arranged to sell the opportunity to this group.  CB Oncology Partners, LLC, (“CBOP”)  was organized September 1, 2017 to acquire the rights of the new center from FOP.
 
In June 2017, FOP entered into an agreement with a third-party owner of a radiation therapy center located in Miami, Florida, whereby FOP took over the operation of the center effective September 22, 2017, for a ten-year initial term, and up to three additional terms of five years each.
 
The Company, through its noncontrolling interest in joint ventures, is currently exploring other opportunities for the establishment of cancer centers using IMRT and/or IGRT in Florida and other parts of the U.S.
 
Gamma Knife Technology
 
The gamma knife is a unique stereotactic radiosurgical device used to treat brain tumors and other malformations of the brain without invasive surgery.  The gamma knife delivers a single, high dose of ionizing radiation emanating from 201 cobalt-60 sources positioned about a hemispherical, precision machined cavity.  The lesion is first targeted with precision accuracy using advanced imaging and three dimensional treatment planning techniques such as CT Scans, MR Scans, conventional X-rays, or angiography.  Each individual beam is focused on a common target producing an intense concentration of radiation at the target site, destroying the lesion while spreading the entry radiation dose uniformly and harmlessly over the patient’s skull.  The mechanical precision at the target site is +/- 0.1mm (1/10 of 1 millimeter).  Because of the steep fall-off in the radiation intensity surrounding the target, the lesion can be destroyed, while sparing the surrounding tissue.

The procedure, performed in a single treatment, sharply reduces hospital stay times and eliminates post-surgical bleeding and infection.  When compared with conventional neurosurgery, gamma knife treatment is less expensive.  However, not all patients are candidates for radiosurgery since the decision to use the gamma knife depends on the type, size, and location of the lesion.
Linear Accelerators
 
A linear particle accelerator (LINAC) is a type of particle accelerator that greatly increases the velocity of charged subatomic particles or ions by subjecting the charged particles to a series of oscillating electric potentials along a linear beamline. LINACs accelerate electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, in which the RF (radio frequency) power creates a standing wave. Some LINACs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines tend to have a horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical LINACs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25 MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease.
 
The intensity of the radiation in IMRT can be changed during treatment to spare more adjoining normal tissue than is spared during conventional radiation therapy. Because of this an increased dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumor using IMRT. IMRT is a type of conformal radiation, which shapes radiation beams to closely approximate the shape of the tumor.
 
IGRT is used to help better deliver radiation therapy to cancerous tumors. This is very useful since tumors can move between treatments due to differences in organ filling or movements while breathing. IGRT involves conformal radiation treatment guided by specialized imaging tests, such as CT scans, ultrasound or X-rays. These tests are done in the treatment room just before the patient is to receive his or her daily radiation therapy treatment.
 
New York Gamma Knife Center
 
The Company’s New York gamma knife treatment center was opened in July 1997 on the campus of NYU Medical Center.  The Company installed a new Leksell gamma knife, the PERFEXION model, at the NYU Medical Center in March 2009 in replacement of the older gamma knife equipment.  In connection with this upgrade, the Company modified its arrangement with NYU to extend the term for 12 years from March 2009.
 
In October 2012, the Company’s facility at NYU was totally destroyed as a result of flooding from Hurricane Sandy. The gamma knife had to be removed to prevent any cobalt leakage that might occur due to rusting of the equipment. The removal cost was $525,000. The Company paid a lease settlement of the outstanding principal balance only and received from insurance coverage $930,000 above the lease principal payments and removal costs.

The Company finalized arrangements with NYU regarding the restoration of the gamma knife center and entered into an amendment to the original Gamma Knife Neuroradiosurgery Equipment Agreement (“NYU Agreement”).  The NYU facility was rebuilt and reopened in the Tisch Hospital of NYU Langone Medical Center.  The first patient was treated on April, 29, 2014. The Company expects to generate revenue from the restored gamma knife center under the NYU contract until March 2021, at which time the NYU contract ends and title to the gamma knife will transfer to NYU.
 
The Company is responsible for the maintenance and insurance for the gamma knife equipment at the NYU facility and earns income for use of the gamma knife based on a fee per procedure performed with the equipment.  NYU provides the medical and technical staff to operate the facility.
 
The Company entered into a six year lease in the amount of $4.7 million for the purchase of the replacement equipment and associated leasehold improvements. The lease payments commenced in September 2014 and end in May 2020. The Company entered into a second two year lease in the amount of $250,000 for the cost of the construction required at the relocated site. The lease ended in 2016.
 
NYU pays the Company a scheduled fee based on the number of patient procedures performed. There were 592 patients treated during the year ended December 31, 2018, whereas in the prior year there were 557 patients treated at the facility. Total revenue in 2018 from NYU was $3,424,000 as opposed to total revenue of $3,414,000 in 2017.
 
In 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Elekta for the installation of new ICON imaging technology for the NYU Gamma Knife equipment with a total cost, including sales taxes, of $816,000. This ICON technology was installed during the month of July 2016 and the gamma knife center reopened on August 5, 2016. The Company entered into a four-year lease for $879,000 to finance the acquisition of the ICON technology and associated installation costs. A monthly maintenance agreement commenced a year after the installation date for $6,000 per month. The two parties also agreed for USN to receive a fixed monthly payment of $30,000 for the remaining term of the agreement through March 2021.
 
In September 2017, the Company and NYU entered into an additional amendment to the NYU Agreement, whereby NYU committed to purchase all of the gamma knife equipment at the NYU Medical Center for a purchase price of $2,400,000, with 41 monthly installments of $50,000 from October 2017 through February 2021, and a final payment of $350,000 on March 31, 2021.  Previously, the NYU agreement ended on March 17, 2021 and NYU had an option to purchase the gamma knife equipment at the appraised value of the equipment at that time.  In June 2017, the Company obtained an independent estimate of $2,570,000 for the fair value of the equipment in March 2021.  The Company believes that the accelerated payments amounting to $2,400,000 represent fair consideration considering all aspects of the transaction.

With the September 2017 amendment, the Company became obligated to reload the cobalt for the gamma knife at its own expense and bear the cost of site work involved in reloading the cobalt, up to a maximum of $1,088,000.  In July 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Elekta for the cobalt reload on the NYU gamma knife equipment with a cost, including sales taxes, of $925,000. This cobalt reload occurred in July 2018, and the gamma knife center reopened on August 6, 2018. The Company obtained lease financing of $833,000 to partially finance the reload of the cobalt, and paid the remaining balance directly to Elekta. In addition, the Company incurred costs of $578,000 to install the new cobalt to be paid directly to the contractor. All cobalt related costs were finalized by October 1, 2018, and totaled $1,503,000. As a result of the Company satisfying its obligation to reload the cobalt, the agreement with NYU met the criteria to be classified as a sales type lease. In addition, the Company is now no longer obligated to restore the NYU facility to its original condition. Accordingly, all related assets and the asset retirement obligation were derecognized effective October 1, 2018.
The Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center
 
During 2007, the Company, through a noncontrolling interest in joint ventures,  managed the formation of the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center at SARH in Upland, California.  Corona Gamma Knife, LLC (“CGK”) is party to a 14-year agreement with SARH to renovate space in the hospital and install and operate a Leksell PERFEXION gamma knife.  CGK leases the gamma knife from NeuroPartners LLC, which holds the gamma knife equipment.  In addition to returns on its ownership interests, USNC expects to receive fees for management services relating to the facility.
 
USNC is a 20% owner of NeuroPartners LLC and owns 39% of CGK.
 
USNC was a 20% guarantor on NeuroPartners LLC’s seven-year lease with respect to the gamma knife equipment and certain leasehold improvements at SARH.  In February 2016, NeuroPartners LLC negotiated a new five- year lease to fund the reloading of cobalt and related construction services.  The new lease of $1,663,000 includes a balance of $668,000 from the prior lease obligations.  This new lease will be paid over 60 months.  The first payment of $31,000 was paid on April 1, 2016 and the final payment will be due on March 1, 2021.  The Company continues to be a 20% guarantor on the new lease and expects any potential obligations from this guarantee would be reduced by the recovery of the related collateral, and thus expects any exposure from this guarantee to be remote.
 
Construction of the SARH gamma knife center was completed in December 2008 and the first patient was treated in January 2009.  The project has been funded principally by outside investors.  While the Company, through its joint ventures, has led the effort in organizing the business and overseeing the development and operation of the SARH center, its investment to date in the SARH center has been minimal.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company received $0 and $65,000 in repayments of amounts previously advanced to NeuroPartners LLC and CGK and $60,000 and $24,000 in distributions, respectively.  Those repayments reduced the amount of losses incurred on prior advances to NeuroPartners LLC and CGK and are included as earnings from investments in unconsolidated entities for the year ended December 31, 2017.  At December 31, 2017, NeuroPartners LLC and CGK have repaid all of the outstanding advances. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s equity in earnings of NeuroPartners LLC and CGK was $181,000 and $151,000, respectively, but only $80,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was recorded due to prior losses and distributions. At December 31, 2018, amounts due from related parties includes $20,000 of distributions receivable from CGK.

Future Gamma Knife Centers
 
The Company is currently exploring other opportunities for gamma knife centers and centers that provide related healthcare services located near hospitals throughout the United States.  Discussions regarding such centers is preliminary and there can be no assurance that any such discussions will result in the opening of new centers.
Florida Oncology Partners
 
During 2010, the Company expanded its market strategy to include opportunities to develop cancer centers featuring radiation therapy.  These centers utilize linear accelerators with IMRT and IGRT capabilities.  In 2010, the Company formed FOP in partnership with local physicians and other investors.  USNC owns a 24% interest in the venture.  FOP’s first center was located in Miami, Florida and opened in the second quarter of 2011.
 
During 2011, FOP entered into a seven-year capital lease with Key Bank for $5,800,000.  Under the terms of the capital lease, USN agreed to guarantee a maximum of $1,433,000, approximately 25% of the original lease obligation in the event of default.  USN was a guarantor jointly with most of the other members of FOP.  The guarantee was eliminated upon repayment of the outstanding lease balance in May 2018. At December 31, 2017, the lease balance was $468,000.
 
In December 2015, FOP entered into an agreement with 21st Century Oncology for the sale of FOP’s Varian Rapid Arc linear accelerator and other medical equipment at the FOP location.  21st Century Oncology paid FOP $1,000,000 as a down payment for the equipment and agreed to make monthly payments of $172,000 for the equipment and all monthly payments due under the equipment lease with Key Bank.  As of this date, 21st Century Oncology has not satisfied all of the terms of the agreement.  In late May 2017, 21st Century Oncology filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and FOP was listed as an unsecured creditor. As a result, since June 2017, FOP has not received the agreed rental payments beyond the monthly payments for the equipment lease.  As noted above, the equipment lease was repaid in May 2018 and title to the equipment was transferred to 21st Century Oncology. In December 2018, FOP was awarded 10,820 shares of 21st Century Oncology Holdings Inc. common stock as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. The market value of these shares is unclear at this time as there is no readily available market for them and, accordingly, no value has been recorded for these shares at December 31, 2018.  FOP will continue to monitor the impact of 21st Century’s bankruptcy and pursue amounts that it is owed.  However, there can be no assurance that FOP will be successful in these efforts.
 
Late in 2016, FOP took initial steps toward the development of a new radiation therapy center in Homestead, Florida.   In December 2016, FOP entered into a ten-year lease agreement for office space located at 20405 Old Cutler Towne Center.  FOP had to deliver an $88,000 letter of credit in conjunction with this office lease which collateral is being held in a restricted certificate of deposit. FOP began incurring architecture costs for planning/refitting the new space.  During the first half of 2017, a financing agreement with BB&T Bank for the medical equipment and leasehold improvements was negotiated and then signed on August 31, 2017.  In November 2017, the amounts for the equipment and leasehold improvements costs were finalized and paid under this financing agreement for a total loan of $4,106,000 to be paid over seven years.  Under the terms of the financing agreement, USN agreed to guarantee the amount initially borrowed. USN is the guarantor with several other members of FOP. The outstanding balance on the financing facility was $3,660,000 at December 31, 2018, and $4,100,000 at December 31, 2017. The Company expects any potential liability from this guarantee to be reduced by the recoveries of the respective collateral.  Late in the third quarter of 2017, it was determined that the business opportunity at this new location should be pursued by a different investor group, and FOP arranged to sell the opportunity to this group.  CBOP was organized on September 1, 2017, to acquire the assets and rights in this new center from FOP.

 Table of Contents
In June 2017, FOP entered into an agreement with a third-party owner of a radiation therapy center located in Miami, Florida, whereby FOP took over the operation of the center effective September 22, 2017, for a ten-year initial term, and up to three additional terms of five years each. This agreement has been accounted for as a capital lease and, accordingly, FOP recorded assets and capital lease liabilities totaling $14,321,000 at September 22, 2017. The lease required monthly payments in the first year of $160,000, increasing by 2% each year; currently the payment is $163,200.
 
The Company’s recorded investment in FOP at December 31, 2018 and 2017 has been reduced to zero due to FOP recording distributions of $950,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and losses incurred in 2018. The Company’s equity in earnings from FOP was $132,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. No equity in earnings has been recorded by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to FOP’s deficit at December 31, 2018.
 
Amounts due from FOP included in due from related parties total $223,000 and $169,000 at December 31, 2018 and, 2017 respectively. In addition, in October 2017, FOP entered into a promissory note payable agreement with the Company. Under this facility, borrowings accrue at 6% per annum. At December 31, 2018, FOP owes $735,000 of principal and $30,000 of accrued interest to the Company. During 2018, the Company provided an allowance of $218,000 against the promissory note receivable, reducing its carrying amount to $517,000 at December 31, 2018. This impairment charge has been included in loss from investments in unconsolidated entities for 2018. There was no corresponding expense in 2017. At December 31, 2017, FOP owed $299,000 under the promissory note, and $2,000 of accrued interest, to the Company. The $436,000 in additional loans during 2018 assisted with the funding of operations of the radiation therapy center in Miami.
 
Because of loans made to FOP, FOP is considered to be a variable interest entity of the Company.  However, as the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of FOP, since it does not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect FOP’s economic performance, the entity is not consolidated, but certain disclosures are provided herein.
 
Boca Oncology Partners
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Company participated in the formation of Boca Oncology Partners, LLC (“BOP”), for the purpose of owning and operating a cancer center in Boca Raton, Florida.  In June 2011, Boca Oncology Partners RE, LLC (“BOPRE”), an affiliated entity, purchased a 20% interest in Boca West IMP, LLC (“Boca West IMP”), owner of a medical office building in West Boca, Florida in which BOP operates.  BOP occupies 6,000 square feet of the 32,000 square foot building.  The Company invested $225,000 initially and had a 22.5% interest in BOP and BOPRE. In February 2014, the Company and other members sold their interests in BOP.
 
 10
 
 Table of Contents
In June 2012, BOPRE purchased an additional 3.75% of Boca West IMP from another investor bringing its total interest to 23.75%. BOPRE accounts for this investment under the cost method since it does not exercise significant influence over Boca West IMP.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, several investors relinquished part of their ownership interest in BOPRE, and those interests were distributed among the remaining investors in relationship to their percentages owned. As a result, the Company now holds a 21.22% ownership interest in BOPRE, which it accounts for under the equity method, at December 31, 2018. The Company held a 21.05% interest in BOPRE at December 31, 2017. The Company’s recorded investment in BOPRE is $168,000 and $164,000 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
USNC is a 10% guarantor of 50% of the outstanding balance of Boca West IMP’s ten-year mortgage.  This mortgage had an original balance of $3,000,000 and is secured by the medical office building in which BOP operates. The outstanding balance on the mortgage is $2,303,000 and $2,417,000  at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Any liability from this guarantee would be mitigated by the recovery from the underlying real estate, and the Company expects its potential exposure from this guarantee to be remote.
 
Medical Oncology Partners
 
In April 2015 MOP, was formed in partnership with local physicians and other investors. MOP was established to acquire a 100% equity interest in UOMA. USNC was not a member of MOP at the time of formation as it was not able to participate due to the fact that USNC was not a physician. Nevertheless, USNC wished to eventually obtain an equity interest in MOP and loaned Dr. Jaime Lozano, the principal investor in MOP and a co-investor in FOP, $173,000.  Dr. Lozano used these funds, along with an equal amount of his own funds (a total of $345,000), to purchase a 76.67% interest in MOP. Other investors paid a further $105,000 for the remaining equity in MOP. MOP used the $450,000 of financing to acquire a 100% equity interest in UOMA.  An application was filed for a waiver to allow USNC to hold an equity interest notwithstanding the physician requirement and on December 22, 2016, USNC was cleared to become a part owner of MOP. Dr. Lozano agreed to exchange half of his membership interest to USNC in settlement of the note to USNC.  USNC and Dr. Lozano also agreed to share equally in providing a 5% equity interest in MOP to an additional investor as a consulting fee for services rendered in the administration of MOP and UOMA. At December 22, 2016, USNC owned 35.83% of MOP with an initial carrying value of $161,000. The Company recorded its share of losses of $12,000 for the period from December 22, 2016 to December 31, 2016, against its investment which resulted in a reduction of its equity investment to $149,000.
 
Due to increasing costs, continued net losses since April 2015, and reliance on related party and other debt for operating cash flows, the fair value of UOMA is less than its carrying amount. The Company tested its investment for impairment at December 31, 2016 and determined that the investment was impaired, and an impairment loss was recorded against the entire equity balance in MOP, as well as loans from USN and USNC to MOP and UOMA. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s equity in loss of MOP was $101,000 and $97,000 respectively but was not recorded due to prior losses.

 Table of Contents
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $245,000 and $223,000 respectively of allowances against advances to MOP. These charges have been recorded as losses from investments in unconsolidated entities.
 
Due to loans made to MOP and UOMA, MOP and UOMA are considered to be  variable interest entities of the Company.  However, as the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of MOP or UOMA, since it does not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect MOP’s or UOMA’s economic performance, the entities are not consolidated, but certain disclosures are provided herein.

Strategy for Participation in Cancer Treatment
 
As a result of the Company’s experiences over the past few years, the Company, through unconsolidated joint ventures, has expanded its focus to the broader based cancer treatment market.  In order to reduce the risk and broaden its opportunities for profitable growth, the Company, through unconsolidated joint ventures, where possible, has been pursuing partnerships with local investors/providers to develop and operate oncology centers that utilize LINACs to treat cancers in the whole body.  The Company also continues to evaluate opportunities to develop additional gamma knife facilities.  FOP, BOP and the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center typify this new strategy.
Employees
