Competition
 
Superior competes in its Uniforms and Related Products segment with more than three dozen firms, including divisions of larger corporations. Superior competes with national and regional companies, such as, Crest—a division of ARAMARK Corporation, Cintas Corporation, Lands’ End, Medline, Standard Textile, Strategic Partners, Inc., Twin Hill and Unifirst Corporation. Superior also competes with local firms in most major metropolitan areas.  The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market.  We believe Superior is one of the leading suppliers of garments to hospitals, retailers, hotels, food service establishments, and linen suppliers. Superior experiences competition primarily based on breadth of products and services offered, styling and pricing. We believe that the strength of our brands and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products, allow us to compete effectively.
 
The market in which TOG operates has evolved into a global multi-billion dollar marketplace that is highly competitive and fragmented. TOG’s competitors in the Remote Staffing Solutions segment range in size from very small firms offering specialized services or short-term project completion to very large independent firms, and include the in-house operations of many customers and potential customers. We compete directly and indirectly with various companies that provide contact center and other business process solutions on an outsourced basis. These companies include, but are certainly not limited to, global providers such as APAC Customer Services, Atento, Convergys, Harte Hanks, Sitel, Sykes and Teleperformance. TOG also competes with local entities in other offshore locations. The list of potential competitors includes both publicly traded and privately held companies.
 
The promotional products industry is highly fragmented. We compete with a multitude of foreign, regional, and local competitors that vary by market. Major competitors in the Promotional Products segment include BDA, Inc., HALO Branded Solutions, Inc. and Staples, Inc., We believe our creative services, product development, proprietary web platforms and extensive global sourcing network, along with our success with major brands, will enable us to continue to be competitive and grow in this market.
 
Customers
 
The Uniform and Related Products segment has a substantial number of customers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 8.5% of that segment’s 2018 net sales. The Remote Staffing Solutions segment’s largest customer represented 10.7% of that segment’s 2018 external revenues, and the largest customer in the Promotional Products segment represented 18.3% of that segment’s net sales in 2018.
Backlog
 
The Uniform and Related Products segment normally completes shipments of orders from stock within three days after the receipt of the order. As of February 18, 2019, the backlog of all orders that we believe to be firm for our Uniform and Related Products segment was approximately $9.0 million, compared to approximately $7.1 million as of February 19, 2018. The backlog mostly consists of future orders which are placed well in advance of when needed and specially made to a customer’s specifications. The Promotional Products segment typically produces custom products based upon confirmed orders. The average length of time to produce orders is four to six months.  The backlog of all orders for our Promotional Products segment was approximately $27.0 million as of February 18, 2019 as compared to $25.0 million as of February 19, 2018.
Raw Materials, Working Capital and Inventory
 
The principal fabrics used in our Uniforms and Related Products segment are made from cotton, polyester, wool, synthetic and cotton-synthetic blends. The majority of such fabrics are sourced in the Far East. The raw materials used in the fabrics we source from our suppliers are primarily cotton, polyester yarn, dyestuffs and chemical components of synthetic fabrics. 
 
Superior’s Uniform and Related Products segment markets itself to its customers as a "stock house."  Therefore, Superior carries substantial inventories of raw materials (principally piece goods) and finished garments, which requires substantial working capital, as we believe to be common in the industry. The segment’s principal raw materials are textile products. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 25%, 34% and 32%, respectively, of the segment’s products were obtained from suppliers located in Central America and Haiti, and approximately 24%, 34% and 31%, respectively, were sourced from China. Superior does not believe that it is dependent upon any of its suppliers, despite the concentration of its purchasing from a few sources, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are readily available. However, if Superior’s Uniform and Related Products segment is unable to continue to obtain its products from Central America, Haiti and China, it could significantly disrupt Superior’s business. Because the Company manufactures and sources products in Central America, Haiti and China, the Company is affected by economic and political conditions in those countries, including possible employee turnover, labor and other unrest and lack of developed infrastructure, as well as decisions by the U.S. government to impose or increase import duties, tariffs or other import regulations.

The Promotional Products segment relies on the supply of different types of raw materials, including plastic, glass, fabric and metal. Prices within the promotional products industry are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. The market for promotional products is price sensitive and has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. The Promotional Products segment has flexibility in its suppliers, as other suppliers of the same or similar products are more widely available. Additionally, the nature of the promotional products industry is such that should specific types of raw materials undergo significant cost increases, it is possible that alternative products using different materials could be utilized for similar promotional activities. However, if cost increases cannot be entirely passed on to customers and alternative suppliers or suitable product alternatives are unavailable, profit margins could decline. Moreover, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, because approximately 28%, 67% and 59%, respectively, of the raw materials and products sourced by the Promotional Products segment came from China, economic and political conditions in China or the United States, including those resulting in the imposition or increase of import duties, tarrifs and other import regulations, could have a material adverse effect on this business segment.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Superior owns and uses several trademarks and service marks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to its ability to market its products. Superior’s most significant trademarks, which are critically important to the marketing and operation of Superior’s uniform segment, are Fashion Seal Healthcare® and WonderWink®. Fashion Seal Healthcare (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2027) represents more than 23% of sales in that segment. WonderWink (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until at least 2021) represents more than 12% of sales in that segment.
Environmental Matters
 
In view of the nature of our business, compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material effect upon our operations or earnings, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the foreseeable future.
Employees
 
Superior employed 2,906 persons, of which 2,877 were full-time employees, as of December 31, 2018.
