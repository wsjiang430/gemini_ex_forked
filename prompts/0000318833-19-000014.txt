ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General Information
Introduction. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Team, Inc.,” “Team,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” are used in this report to refer to Team, Inc., to one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. We incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2006 and our company website can be found at www.teaminc.com. Our corporate headquarters is located at 13131 Dairy Ashford, Suite 600, Sugar Land, Texas, 77478 and our telephone number is (281) 331-6154. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “TISI.” On November 10, 2015, we announced a change of our fiscal year end to December 31 of each calendar year from May 31. 
We are a leading provider of standard to specialty industrial services, including inspection, engineering assessment and mechanical repair and remediation required in maintaining high temperature and high pressure piping systems and vessels that are utilized extensively in the refining, petrochemical, power, pipeline and other heavy industries. We conduct operations in three segments: Inspection and Heat Treating Group (“IHT”) (formerly TeamQualspec), Mechanical Services Group (“MS”) (formerly TeamFurmanite) and Quest Integrity Group (“Quest Integrity”). Through the capabilities and resources in these three segments, we believe that Team is uniquely qualified to provide integrated solutions involving in their most basic form: inspection to assess condition, engineering assessment to determine fitness for purpose in the context of industry standards and regulatory codes and mechanical services to repair, rerate or replace based upon the client’s election. In addition, the Company is capable of escalating with the client’s needs, as dictated by the severity of the damage found and the related operating conditions, from standard services to some of the most advanced services and integrated asset integrity and reliability management solutions available in the industry. We also believe that Team is unique in its ability to provide services in three distinct client demand profiles: (i) turnaround or project services, (ii) call-out services and (iii) nested or run-and-maintain services. 
IHT provides standard and advanced non-destructive testing (“NDT”) services primarily for the process, pipeline and power sectors, pipeline integrity management services, field heat treating services, as well as associated engineering and condition assessment services. These services can be offered while facilities are running (on-stream), during facility turnarounds or during new construction or expansion activities.
MS provides primarily call-out and turnaround services under both on-stream and off-line/shut down circumstances. On-stream services offered by MS represent the services offered while plants are operating and under pressure. These services include leak repair, fugitive emissions control and hot tapping and line intervention and help operators manage the material opportunity costs associated with bringing down process, transportation or storage infrastructure. Turnaround services are project-related and demand is a function of the number and scope of scheduled and unscheduled facility turnarounds as well as new industrial facility construction or expansion activities. The turnaround and call-out services MS provides include field machining, technical bolting, isolation test plugging, field valve repair and valve product sales.
Quest Integrity provides integrity and reliability management solutions for the process, pipeline and power sectors. These solutions encompass three broadly-defined disciplines: (1) highly specialized in-line inspection services for unpiggable process piping and pipelines using proprietary in-line inspection tools and analytical software; (2) advanced engineering and condition assessment services through a multi-disciplined engineering team and related lab support; and (3) advanced digital imaging including remote digital video imaging, laser scanning and laser profilometry-enabled reformer care services.
We offer these services globally through over 200 locations in 20 countries throughout the world with approximately 7,200 employees. We market our services to companies in a diverse array of heavy industries which include the petrochemical, refining, power, pipeline, steel, pulp and paper industries, as well as municipalities, shipbuilding, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), distributors, and some of the world’s largest engineering and construction firms. 
In September 2017, Ted W. Owen stepped down as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Gary G. Yesavage, a member of the Team board of directors (the “Board”), was appointed as Team’s Interim CEO until the appointment of Amerino Gatti as CEO and member of the Board in January 2018.

In July 2018, we announced an organizational restructuring. The organizational changes include a Product and Service Line organization and an Operations organization. The Product and Service Lines organization is responsible for value positioning and pricing, standardization of best practices, technical training and program development, and technology innovation across Team’s global enterprise. The Operations organization, comprised of cross-segment divisions aligned by major geographic regions, will be responsible for executing product and service delivery in accordance with established Team service line standards, safety and quality protocols. Overall company management and decision-making by our chief operating decision maker continues to be performed according to the structure of the three operating segments (IHT, MS and Quest Integrity). Accordingly, these changes had no effect on our reportable segments.
Narrative Description of Business
Inspection and Heat Treating Group:
IHT offers standard to specialty inspection services as well as heat treating services. Heat treating services are generally associated with turnaround or project activities. A description of these core IHT services is as follows:
Non-Destructive Evaluation and Testing Services. Machined parts and industrial structures can be complex systems that experience extreme loads and fatigue during their lifetime. Our Non-Destructive Evaluation (“NDE”) or our NDT enables the inspection of these components without permanently altering the equipment. It is a highly valuable technique that is often used to validate the integrity of materials, detect instabilities, discover performance outside of tolerances, identify failed components, or highlight an inadequate control system. Inspection services frequently require industry recognized training and certification. We employ training and certification programs, which are designed to meet or exceed industry standards. As assets continue to age, often beyond original design life, and compliance regulations advance in parallel, inspection and assessment techniques are playing a critical role in safely monitoring fitness-for-service and where practical, extending the useful life of this aging infrastructure.
Radiographic Testing. Radiographic Testing (“RT”) is used to detect discontinuities in ferrous and nonferrous castings, welds or forgings using X-ray or gamma ray radiation. RT reveals both external and internal defects, internal assembly details and changes in thickness. Our licensed technicians utilize conventional, computed and real-time radiography testing techniques depending upon the complexity and needs of our customers.
Ultrasonic Testing. Ultrasonic Testing (“UT”) uses high frequency ultrasonic waves to detect surface breaking and internal imperfections, measure material thickness and determine acceptance or rejection of a test object based on a reference code or standard. We offer ten different types of UT methods, including traditional scans as well as automated and high speed ultrasonic Electro Magnet Acoustic Transducer testing. Each method is utilized to meet a specific material or process application requirement.
Magnetic Particle Inspection. Magnetic Particle Inspection is an NDT process for detecting surface and slightly subsurface discontinuities in ferroelectric materials such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and some of their alloys. The process puts a magnetic field into the test object. When the part is magnetized, flaws perpendicular to the magnetic field direction cause flux leakage. If a lapse or a crack is present, the magnetic particles will be attracted to the flawed area, providing our technician with what is called an indication. Our technician will then evaluate the indication to assess the location, size, shape and extent of these imperfections.
Liquid Penetrant Inspection. Liquid Penetrant Inspection is one of the most widely used NDE/NDT methods. Its popularity can be attributed to two main factors: its relative ease of use and its flexibility. Liquid Penetrant Inspection can be used to inspect almost any material. At Team, we utilize Liquid Penetrant Inspection to detect surface discontinuities in both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials. In castings and forgings, there may be cracks or leaks in new products or fatigue cracks in in-service components.
Positive Material Identification. Positive Material Identification (“PMI”) quickly and accurately identifies the composition of more than 100 different engineering alloys onsite. Team can perform PMI on virtually any size or shape of pipe, plate, weld, welding materials, machined parts or castings.
Electromagnetic Testing. Electromagnetic Testing applies to a family of test methods that use magnetism and electricity to detect or measure cracks, flaws, corrosion or heat damage in conductive materials. Magnetic properties and geometric analysis are used to determine the best technique to identify defects. Our electromagnetic services enable our technicians to evaluate small cracks, pits, dents and general thinning in tubing with small diameters, large steel surfaces such as storage tank floors, and everything in between.
Alternating Current Field Measurement. Originally developed for inspection of fatigue cracking, our Alternating Current Field Measurement (“ACFM”) is an advanced technique for detecting surface cracks and pinpointing the location, length and depth of the defect. Our ACFM works through paint and coatings and in a wide range of temperatures. Results are automatically recorded and accepted by certification authorities.
2

Eddy Current Testing. Eddy Current Testing (“ECT”) is ideal for nonferrous materials such as heat exchanger tubes, condensers, boilers, tubing and aircraft surfaces. Team’s ECT uses electromagnetic induction to detect flaws in conductive materials, displaying the presence of very small cracks, pits, dents and general thinning.
Long-Range Guided Ultrasonics. Guided wave inspection is a method of ultrasonic testing that enables the detection and location of pipe defects above and below ground without disruption of service. This technique only requires a small area of excavation to perform the testing where applicable. Guided ultrasonics sends a bilateral signal over hundreds of feet allowing long ranges of piping to be inspected at one time.
Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing. Phased Array Ultrasonics (“PAUT”) provides sharper detection capability for off-angle cracks and is capable of displaying multiple presentations simultaneously. PAUT applies computer-controlled excitation to individual elements in a multi-element probe. By varying the timing of the excitation, the sound beam can be swept through a range of angles. The shape of the beam may also be modified to a specific focal distance or spot.
Tank Inspection and Management Programs. Our above ground storage tank (“ABST”) inspection and management team, TCI Services, Inc. (“TCI”), specializes in performing inspections, condition assessment and selected repair services across the United States (“U.S.”) for ABST and related infrastructure. Backed by Team’s in-house engineering, documentation and certification services – including American Petroleum Institute 653 evaluations – TCI’s on-site tank inspections, repair and maintenance services help keep customers’ tanks fully operational and compliant with stringent industry standards.
Rope Access. We provide a range of innovative and cost-effective solutions to suit the customer’s individual requirements for inspection and maintenance services for the energy and industrial markets. Our rope access solutions allow for work to be carried out safely and quicker than traditional methods using scaffolding, keeping costs and job duration to a minimum. We provide these services under full accreditation by the Industrial Rope Access Trade Association, whose guidelines are recognized by the industry as the safest method of working at height.
Mechanical Integrity Services. Maintaining the integrity of equipment is more than simply performing inspections. A well-implemented Mechanical Integrity (“MI”) program involves multiple components that improve the safety and reliability of a facility’s equipment. Our MI programs are designed to ensure the continued integrity and fitness for service of piping systems, pressure vessels, tanks and related components. We believe our mechanical integrity engineers are well versed in pertinent codes and standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (“OSHA”) process safety management and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) risk management program regulations.
Field Heat Treating Services. Field Heat Treating Services include electric resistance and gas-fired combustion, primarily utilized by industrial customers to enhance the metallurgical properties of their process piping and equipment. Electric resistance heating is the transfer of high energy power sources through attached heaters to the plant component to preheat weld joints, to remove contaminants and moisture prior to welding, for post-weld heat treatments and to relieve metal thermal stresses induced by the welding process. Specialty heat treating processes are performed using gas-fired combustion on large pressure vessels for stress relieving to bake specialty paint coatings and controlled drying of abrasion and temperature resistant refractories. Special high frequency heating, commonly called induction heating, is used for expanding metal parts for assembly or disassembly, expanding large bolting for industrial turbines and stress relieving projects which are cost prohibitive for electric resistance or gas-fired combustion.
Mechanical Services Group:
MS offers standard to specialty services within both on-stream and turnaround/project-related environments. A description of these core MS services is as follows:
Leak Repair Services. Our leak repair services consist of on-stream repairs of leaks in pipes, valves, flanges and other parts of piping systems, pipelines and related equipment. Our on-stream repairs utilize composite repair, drill and tap repair, and both standard and custom-designed clamps and enclosures for process piping and pipelines. We use specially developed techniques, sealants and equipment for repairs. Many of our repairs are furnished as interim measures which allow plant systems to continue operating until more permanent repairs can be made during plant shut downs. Our leak repair services involve inspection of the leak by our field technicians who record pertinent information about the faulty part of the system and transmits the information to our engineering department for determination of appropriate repair techniques. Repair materials such as clamps and enclosures are custom designed and manufactured at our International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)-9001 certified manufacturing centers and delivered to the job site. We maintain an inventory of raw materials and semi-finished clamps and enclosures to reduce the time required to manufacture the finished product.
Fugitive Emissions Control Services. We provide fugitive volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emission leak detection services that include identification, monitoring, data management and reporting primarily for the chemical, refining and natural gas processing industries. These services are designed to monitor and record VOC emissions from specific process equipment and 
3

piping components as required by environmental regulations and customer requests, typically assisting the customer in enhancing an ongoing maintenance program and/or complying with present and/or future environmental regulations. We provide specialty trained technicians in the use of portable organic chemical analyzers and data loggers to measure potential leaks at designated plant components maintained in customer or our proprietary databases. The measured data is used to prepare standard reports in compliance with EPA and local regulatory requirements. We also provide enhanced custom-designed reports to customer specifications.
Hot Tapping Services. Our hot tapping services consist of a full range of hot tapping, Line-stopTM and Freeze-stopTM services with capabilities for up to 48” diameter pipelines. Hot tapping services involve utilizing special equipment to cut a hole in a pressurized pipeline so that a new branch pipe can be connected onto the existing pipeline without interrupting operations. Line-stopTM services permit the line to be depressurized downstream so that maintenance work can be performed on the piping system. We typically perform these services by mechanically cutting into the pipeline similar to a hot tap and installing a special plugging device to stop the process flow. The Hi-stopTM is a proprietary procedure that allows stopping of process flows under typically more extreme pressures and temperatures. In some cases, we may use a line freezing procedure by injecting liquid nitrogen into installed special external chambers around the pipe to stop the process flow. Inflatable bag stops are used when a pipe is out of round or inside surface conditions of the pipe prevent a standard line stop. Bag stops can also be used to back up a line stop. A small hot tap is made into a pipe and an inflatable pipe plug is inserted into the pipe to allow the plug to stop the flow in the pipe. Additionally, we provide innovative line stop applications for unique service applications to meet customers’ more unconventional needs.
Field Machining Services and Technical Bolting Services. We use portable machining equipment to repair or modify machinery, equipment, vessels and piping systems not easily removed from a permanent location. As opposed to conventional machining processes where the work piece rotates and the cutting tool is fixed, in field machining, the work piece remains fixed in position and the cutting tool rotates. Other common descriptions for this service are on-site or in-place machining. Field machining services include flange facing, pipe cutting, line boring, journal turning, drilling and milling. We provide customers technical bolting as a complementary service to field machining during plant shut downs or maintenance activities. These services involve the use of hydraulic or pneumatic equipment with industry standard bolt tightening techniques to achieve reliable and leak-free connections following plant maintenance or expansion projects. Additional services include bolt disassembly and hot bolting, which is a technique to remove and replace a bolt while on-line under pressure and temperature. 
Valve Repair Services and Products. We perform on-site and shop-based repairs to manual and control valves and pressure and safety relief valves as well as specialty valve actuator diagnostics and repair. We are certified and authorized to perform testing and repairs to pressure and safety relief valves by The National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors (the “NBBPVI”). This certification requires specific procedures, testing and documentation to maintain the safe operation of these essential plant valves. We provide special transportable trailers to the plant site which contain specialty machines to manufacture valve components without removing the valve from the piping system. In addition, we provide preventive maintenance programs for VOC specific valves and valve data management programs. We also represent selected valve manufacturers and distributes their products where complementary to our clients’ valve supply and management needs. 
Field Welding. We perform certified manual, semi-automatic and fully automated machine welding services in a variety of specialty industrial applications. All Team welders are certified to applicable American Society of Mechanical Engineers (“ASME”) code and we are authorized by the NBBPVI for the repair of nuclear components, boilers and other pressure-containing components.
Isolation and Test Plug Services. We install isolation plugs to provide a mechanical block of flammable atmosphere to allow for pipe cutting and welding down or upstream without having to purge the entire piping system. The plugs are mechanically expanded to seal on the inside pipe surface and provide a venting system to prevent pressure from building up in the piping system while the system is opened. Test plugs are used to verify the integrity of welded joints by providing sealing surfaces on both sides of the weld and pressuring the void cavity in between. The test plugs allow the customer to comply with the ASME hydrostatic test requirements for welded joints without having to pressurize the whole system which may result in shutdown of other systems or environmental issues with the test medium.
Valve Insertion Services. We offer professional installation services for our patented InsertValveTM. The valve installs under pressure, eliminating the need for line shut downs in the event of planned or emergency valve cut-ins. Designed for a wide range of line sizes and types, the InsertValveTM wedge gate sits on the valve body, not the pipe bottom. This unique feature prevents the seat from coming into contact with the cut pipe edges to significantly extend valve life. If a repair is ever needed, we believe it is the only valve on the market that can be repaired under pressure.

Quest Integrity’s advanced quantitative inspection services utilize proprietary non-destructive testing and examination (NDT/NDE) instrumentation to provide technology-enabled in-line inspections of fired heaters, pipelines, process piping systems and steam reformers, primarily to the process, pipeline and power industries. Additionally, Quest Integrity offers engineering assessment services enabled by proprietary software and other analytical tools, and lab testing and analysis resources. 
Quest Integrity’s major service offerings are described as follows:
Furnace Tube Inspection System-Enabled Services. Furnace Tube Inspection System (“FTISTM”) in-line inspection service provides an untethered 360-degree 100% coverage ultrasonic inspection of the internal and external surfaces of serpentine coils of fired heaters, which are found in refineries and other process plant environments. FTISTM allows us to detect and quantify internal/external pipe/tube wall loss, deformation and fouling and thereby identify weak points in such heaters in order to provide customers with timely, actionable information to better manage their infrastructure.
InVistaTM-Enabled Services. Our proprietary InVistaTM in-line inspection service provides an untethered 360-degree 100% coverage ultrasonic inspection of the internal and external surfaces of pipelines and process piping that are considered “unpiggable” or too challenging to inspect by traditional inspection methods, due to a number of factors. InVistaTM allows us to detect and quantify pipe/tube internal/external wall loss, deformation, pitting and fouling in such pipelines and process piping. Our standard InVistaTM deliverable also provides a fitness-for-service assessment on the pipe and displays the information in a highly intuitive format, providing an integrated inspection plus condition assessment solution for customers.
Pipeline Integrity Management Services. We offer turn-key Pipeline Integrity Management services, including project management, integrity engineering and integrity management development services, in-line inspection support such as cleaning and launching/receiving, pig tracking and materials equipment selection and procurement. We offer these resources on an integrated basis with our InVistaTM in-line inspection services and engineering assessment capabilities, or individually as applicable.
Advanced Engineering and Condition Assessment Services. Employing a multi-disciplined engineering team, supported by proprietary software, other analytical tools and lab testing capability, we offer a variety of advanced engineering assessment services to customers in the process, power, pipeline, petrochemical and alternative energy industries including fitness-for-service, computational mechanics, failure analysis, risk-based asset management and materials consulting.
Advanced Digital Imaging Services. Quest Integrity offers Advanced Digital Imaging (“ADI”) services utilizing a combination of proprietary and advanced third party equipment, including video, laser scanning, robotic crawlers and aerial drones, to remotely capture digital images in difficult or dangerous to access locations in and around energy industry infrastructure. We often deliver such services as part of an integrated solution where ADI may complement or further inform other inspection and condition assessment techniques. 
Acquisitions
In June 2016, we acquired a mechanical furnace and pipe cleaning business in Europe, Turbinate International B.V. (“Turbinate”) for approximately $8 million. Recognized as a service leader in the European market, Turbinate specializes in de-coking and cleaning of fired heaters and unpiggable refinery assets as well as mechanical cleaning of furnaces and pipes from two to 18 inches in diameter by means of pigging, endoscopy and ultra sound inspection services. Turbinate is located in Vianen, the Netherlands. Turbinate is reported in the Quest Integrity segment.
In April 2016, we acquired two related businesses in Europe: Quality Inspection Services (“QIS”) and TiaT Europe (“TiaT”) for a total of approximately $9 million. QIS is an NDT inspection company and TiaT is an NDT training school and consultancy and engineering company recognized as a specialist in aerospace inspections. Both companies are located in Roosendaal, the Netherlands. The businesses added approximately 65 employees to our organization in Europe and collectively serve clients in the on and offshore energy, steel construction, shipbuilding and repair and aerospace industries. QIS is the fourth largest NDT inspection company in the Netherlands and represents IHT’s first inspection operation outside of North America. QIS and TiaT are reported in the IHT segment.
In February 2016, we completed our acquisition of Furmanite Corporation (now Furmanite LLC, “Furmanite”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) under which we acquired all the outstanding shares of Furmanite in a stock transaction at a value of approximately $282.3 million which included the payoff, immediately prior to closing, of approximately $70.8 million in Furmanite debt. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Furmanite shareholders received 0.215 
5

shares of Team common stock for each share of Furmanite common stock they owned. The combination doubled the size of Team’s mechanical services capabilities and established a deeper, broader talent and resource pool that better supports customers across standard and specialty mechanical services worldwide. In addition, our expanded capability and capacity offers an enhanced single-point of accountability and flexibility in addressing some of the most critical needs of clients; whether as individual services or as part of an integrated specialty industrial services solution. The purchase price allocation included net working capital of $143.9 million, $63.3 million in fixed assets, $89.0 million in intangibles, $91.4 million of non-current deferred tax liabilities, $13.5 million of defined benefit pension liabilities with $89.6 million allocated to goodwill. Our consolidated results include the activity of Furmanite beginning on the acquisition date of February 29, 2016. Included in the Furmanite acquisition was a process management inspection services business serving contractors and operators participating primarily in the midstream oil and gas market in the U.S. Upon acquisition, we determined that this business was not a strategic fit for Team and shortly thereafter began marketing the business to prospective buyers. We completed the sale of this operation in December 2016. The operating results of this business were reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. 
In July 2015, we acquired 100% of the membership interests in Qualspec Group LLC (“Qualspec”) for total cash consideration of $255.5 million. Qualspec is a leading provider of NDT services in the U.S., with significant operations in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and Mid-Western areas of the country. Qualspec was primarily specialized in nested or run-and-maintain services and adds strength to our resident refinery inspection programs with major customer relationships across the U.S., as well as to our already strong capabilities in advanced inspection services, rope access services and the delivery of innovative inspection and condition assessment technologies to our customers. The purchase of Qualspec was financed through borrowings under our banking credit facility. The purchase price allocation included net working capital of $16.3 million, $15.5 million in fixed assets, $78.1 million in intangibles, $3.0 million of non-current deferred tax liability, with $148.5 million allocated to goodwill. Our consolidated results include the activity of Qualspec beginning on the acquisition date of July 7, 2015 in the IHT segment.
In June 2015, we purchased DK Amans Valve, an advanced valve leader located in Long Beach, California, with a portfolio of projects from various sectors including oil and gas refining, pipelines and power generation for a total consideration of $12.3 million, net of cash acquired of $0.1 million. The purchase price included net working capital of $3.0 million, $0.6 million in fixed assets and $8.8 million in intangibles that includes $2.5 million allocated to goodwill. The purchase price allocation included contingent consideration initially valued at $1.8 million, but as a result of meeting certain performance targets, ultimately resulted in the payment of additional consideration of $4.0 million. DK Amans Valve is reported in the MS segment.
In August 2014, we purchased a valve repair company in the U.K. for total consideration of $3.1 million, net of cash acquired of $0.2 million, including estimated contingent consideration of $0.3 million. Our purchase price allocation resulted in $2.1 million being allocated to fixed assets and net working capital and $1.0 million being applied to goodwill and intangible assets. This business is reported in the MS segment.
Marketing and Customers
Our industrial services are marketed principally by personnel based at our service locations. We believe that these service locations are situated to facilitate timely responses to customer needs with on-call expertise, which is an important feature of selling and providing our services. The capacity and capability scope of our discrete and integrated services also allows us to benefit from the procurement trends of many of our customers who are seeking reductions in the number of contractors and vendors in their facilities, as well as outsourcing more of such services. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
Generally, customers are billed on a time and materials basis, although some work may be performed pursuant to a fixed-price bid. Services are usually performed pursuant to purchase orders issued under written customer agreements. While most purchase orders provide for the performance of a single job, some provide for services to be performed on a run-and-maintain basis. Substantially all our agreements and contracts may be terminated by either party on short notice. The agreements generally specify the range of services to be performed and the hourly rates for labor. While many contracts cover specific plants or locations, we also enter into multiple-site regional or national contracts which cover multiple plants or locations.
Seasonality
We experience some seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the refining industry has scheduled plant shutdowns (commonly referred to as “turnarounds”) for the fall and spring seasons. The power industry follows a similar seasonal schedule for their plant maintenance. The timing of large turnarounds or outages can significantly impact our revenues.
6

Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 7,200 employees in our worldwide operations. Our employees in the U.S. are predominantly non-unionized. Most of our Canadian employees and certain employees outside of North America, primarily Europe, are unionized. There have been no employee work stoppages to date and we believe our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are fair and productive.
Regulation
A significant portion of our business activities are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations are administered by various foreign, federal, state and local health and safety and environmental agencies and authorities, including OSHA of the U.S. Department of Labor and the EPA. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may involve civil and criminal liability. From time to time, we are also subject to a wide range of reporting requirements, certifications and compliance as prescribed by various federal and state governmental agencies that include, but are not limited to, the EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Chemical Safety Board, the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the normal course of our business and are neither material nor place us at any competitive disadvantage. We do not currently expect that compliance with such laws and regulations will require us to make material expenditures.
From time to time, during the operation of our environmental consulting and engineering services, the assets of which were sold in 1996, we handled small quantities of certain hazardous wastes or other substances generated by our customers. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (the “Superfund Act”), the EPA is authorized to take administrative and judicial action to either cause parties who are responsible under the Superfund Act for cleaning up any unauthorized release of hazardous substances to do so, or to clean up such hazardous substances and to seek reimbursement of the costs thereof from the responsible parties, who are jointly and severally liable for such costs under the Superfund Act. The EPA may also bring suit for treble damages from responsible parties who unreasonably refuse to voluntarily participate in such a clean-up or funding thereof. Similarly, private parties who bear the costs of cleanup may seek to recover all or part of their costs from responsible parties in cost recovery or contribution actions. Responsible parties include anyone who owns or operates the facility where the release occurred (either currently and/or at the time such hazardous substances were disposed of), or who by contract arranges for disposal, treatment, transportation for disposal or treatment of a hazardous substance, or who accepts hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities selected by such person from which there is a release. We believe that our risk of liability is minimized since our handling consisted solely of maintaining and storing small samples of materials for laboratory analysis that are classified as hazardous. Due to its prohibitive costs, we accordingly do not currently carry insurance to cover liabilities which we may incur under the Superfund Act or similar environmental statutes.
Intellectual Property
We hold various patents, trademarks, trade secrets and licenses, which have not historically been material to our consolidated business operations. However, Quest Integrity has significant trade secrets and intellectual property pertaining to its proprietary inspection and engineering assessment and software tools. This subsidiary was acquired in November 2010 and a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to these intangible assets.
Competition
In general, competition stems from a large number of other outside service contractors. More than 100 different competitors are currently active in our markets. We believe we have a competitive advantage over most service contractors due to the quality, training and experience of our technicians, our nationwide and increasingly international service capability, the breadth and depth of our services, our ability to provide such services on an integrated, more turnkey basis, and our technical support and manufacturing capabilities supporting the service network. However, there are other competitors that may offer a similar range of coverage or services and include, but are not limited to, Acuren Group, Inc., Guardian Compliance, Mistras Group, Inc., Stronghold Ltd. (a subsidiary of Quanta Services Inc.) and T.D. Williamson, Inc.
