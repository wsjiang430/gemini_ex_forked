 Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to a bold mission: to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying drivers of heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world, representing an estimated 32% of all global fatalities. In the United States (U.S.), one in every five deaths is attributable to heart disease, and an estimated 40,000 infants are born each year with congenital heart disease. While there is a clear need for improved treatments, the rate of cardiovascular drug product approvals has declined in recent years and few of the approved treatments address the underlying cause of such diseases.
Leveraging an improved understanding of the genetic causes of heart disease as well as an increased recognition that precision medicine initiatives may accelerate the advancement of scientific breakthroughs, our vision is to change the treatment paradigm for heart disease and in doing so, improve and extend the lives of patients. Roughly one-third to one-half of all heart diseases are linked to genetic risks, regardless of major racial and ethnic backgrounds, and there are over 250 known genetically defined disorders where the primary source of morbidity and mortality involves the heart. Our collective understanding of the links between heart disease and genetic factors is increasing exponentially, creating new opportunities for the advancement of novel disease-modifying therapeutics that target the underlying cause of disease.
 We are advancing a deep and diverse pipeline of therapeutic programs intended for both rare and highly prevalent forms of heart disease. Each of our lead product candidates, TN-201, a gene therapy for myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3)-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), TN-301, a small molecule for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and TN-401, a gene therapy for plakophilin 2 (PKP2)-associated arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), emerged from our proprietary integrated drug discovery platforms and has progressed to the clinic or late-stage preclinical development with the support of our core internal capabilities.
In addition to our lead product candidates, we have multiple early-stage programs progressing through pre-clinical development. These programs include an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy designed to express the Dwarf Open Reading Frame (DWORF) gene in the heart with potentially broad utility in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), as well as our reprogramming program for cardiac regeneration which aims to replace heart cells lost in patients experiencing heart failure due to prior myocardial infarction (MI). While these named programs have reached candidate selection stage, we also have numerous earlier-stage programs emerging from our proprietary product platforms to address other forms of heart failure.
 Our distinct, but interrelated Gene Therapy, Cellular Regeneration and Precision Medicine platforms and suite of integrated capabilities support our efforts to discover disease-modifying treatments focused on heart disease in a modality-agnostic manner. We also continue to invest in complementary new technologies and the optimization of our existing proprietary capabilities, including the use of human-induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) disease models, machine learning and phenotypic screening, capsid engineering and novel promoter constructs to enable the discovery, design, delivery and development of therapeutics that are best suited to a given cardiovascular condition. In 2022 we also launched operations of our Genetic Medicines Manufacturing Center (GMMC) based in Union City, CA. The facility utilizes a modular, scalable design to produce AAV-based gene therapies under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) standards.


Our Product Pipeline
Our pipeline includes programs that have emerged from our internal efforts, as well as programs that are based on intellectual property licensed from academic institutions.

* US Prevalence refers to the number of patients in the U.S. with the indication based on publicly available market data

TN-201: TN-201 is our potential first-in-class gene therapy for adults and children with HCM due to MYBPC3 gene mutations, the most common cause of familial HCM. MYBPC3-associated HCM is estimated to affect more than 115,000 patients in the U.S. These mutations can cause the heart walls of affected individuals to become significantly thickened, leading to fibrosis, abnormal heart rhythms, cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. HCM is a chronic, progressive condition and those diagnosed with disease often experience significant impairment in overall heart function and quality of life. Those with sarcomeric genetic mutations, such as MYBPC3, are at increased risk of early disease onset, accelerated disease progression and disease-related mortality. TN-201 uses a differentiated approach to deliver a functional MYBPC3 gene to the heart utilizing a recombinant AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid to restore expression of the cardiac myosin binding protein (MyBP-C) to halt disease progression and potentially reverse the course of genetic HCM following a single intravenous injection. TN-201 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission (EC). In January 2023, we received notification from the FDA that clinical testing of TN-201 may proceed, and in the third quarter of 2023, we expect to begin dosing patients in a Phase 1b multi-center, open-label clinical trial, designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-201. Data from the trial is anticipated in 2024.
TN-301: TN-301 is our highly specific small molecule inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). TN-301 is initially being developed for the potential treatment of HFpEF. HFpEF is characterized by a stiffening of the heart muscle resulting in an inability for the left ventricle (LV) to relax properly during normal heart rhythm, referred to as diastolic dysfunction. There are several cellular processes thought to underly the pathophysiology of HFpEF including increases in fibrosis and inflammation and defects in metabolism. Although HFpEF accounts for approximately 50% of all heart failures, there are few proven treatment options. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult participants to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating oral doses of TN-301. The Phase 1 clinical trial is being conducted in two stages: a single-ascending dose (SAD) stage and a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) stage. Data from both the SAD and MAD stages of the trial are anticipated in the second half of 2023.
TN-401: We are developing a potential first-in-class AAV-based gene therapy, TN-401, designed to deliver a functional PKP2 gene in adults with ARVC due to a PKP2 genetic mutation. PKP2-associated ARVC is estimated to affect more than 70,000 patients in the U.S. PKP2 mutations can cause enlargement of the right ventricle (RV) in affected individuals, replacement of heart muscle with fibrotic tissue and fatty deposits, and severely abnormal heart

rhythms (arrhythmia) that can make it harder for the heart to function properly and result in sudden cardiac death in some adults and children. Our product candidate, TN-401, has demonstrated prevention of disease progression and survival benefit after a single dose in a mouse model of ARVC, as well as tolerability in a pilot non-Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) toxicology and biodistribution study. TN-401 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA. We have initiated investigational new drug application (IND)-enabling studies for TN-401 and expect to submit an IND to the FDA in the second half of 2023 to enable clinical development of TN-401.
 Early-Stage Research Efforts: In addition to our lead product candidates, we have multiple early-stage programs progressing through preclinical development, including an AAV-based gene therapy designed to express the DWORF gene in the heart with potentially broad utility in DCM and a cellular reprogramming program for cardiac regeneration which aims to replace heart cells lost due to prior MI. Our researchers are conducting preclinical testing of these and several other genetically targeted leads emerging from our proprietary product platforms to address other forms of heart failure. In addition to our novel drug discovery efforts, we continue to invest in the further development of our gene therapy-enabling technologies and capabilities. Among the most advanced of these initiatives is an effort to identify novel AAV capsids designed to deliver cardiac gene therapy with enhanced specificity and expression compared to current AAV vectors, with the goal of optimizing gene therapy safety, dosing and efficacy.
 Our Product Platforms
 We have established three distinct but interrelated product platforms -- Gene Therapy, Cellular Regeneration and Precision Medicine -- to discover novel therapies for various forms of heart disease. These platforms bring together differentiated science, capabilities, and intellectual property to enable multi-modality drug discovery. We believe these three product platforms, together with our suite of proprietary capabilities, provide us greater insight into disease processes, create more opportunities for successful drug development, mitigate scientific risks, and differentiate our efforts relative to competitors.


   1.Our Gene Therapy platform uses AAVs to deliver healthy genes to specific cells in the heart to correct or compensate for functional defects. While our lead gene therapy programs utilize AAV9 to deliver healthy genes to the heart, we have the ability to use both known AAV capsids as well as novel capsids identified through our internal capsid engineering capabilities. In the future, we may also explore other delivery options, including non-viral delivery. Depending on the nature of the disease, we may target cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, or other cells important to the proper functioning of the heart. The product candidates arising from this platform are intended to overcome the shortcomings of traditional 


therapies that are not able to address the underlying problems that contribute to heart disease. We believe this platform has potentially broad utility for both rare and prevalent forms of heart disease.
2.Our Cellular Regeneration platform uses viral vectors to deliver specific combinations of genes to existing cells in the heart to regenerate cardiomyocytes through two distinct in vivo approaches: One approach uses AAV vectors to deliver proprietary combinations of genes that induce the resident cardiac fibroblasts to convert to cardiomyocytes. Another approach uses non-integrating lentiviruses to deliver proprietary combinations of genes that induce the resident cardiomyocytes to undergo transient cell division. The product candidates arising from this platform are intended to overcome the shortcomings of traditional therapies that address symptoms but are not able to address the irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes. We believe this platform has potentially broad utility across a range of heart conditions that result in the loss of cardiomyocytes, including MI, chemotherapy-related toxicity, and viral infection. 
 3.Our Precision Medicine platform for target identification uses human genetic information combined with phenotypic high throughput screening in our proprietary human iPSC-CM models of human disease and machine learning algorithms for the identification and validation of novel targets for heart diseases. Targets may be further characterized using three-dimensional human engineered heart tissues. By leveraging human cells and tissues to identify and/or validate heart disease targets, this platform is intended to overcome the shortcomings of traditional drug development efforts that rely more heavily on insights from animal models. We believe this platform may also help identify promising drug targets directed to sub-populations of patients who are more likely to respond to such targeted product candidates. We believe this platform has potentially broad utility for the identification of targets and therapies in a modality-agnostic manner—including gene therapy, small molecules, and biologics—for both genetic and non-genetic forms of heart disease. 
 Our Core Capabilities
Foundational to our research and drug discovery efforts are our proprietary integrated core capabilities that collectively support discovery of novel targets, in vitro optimization and validation of leads, rapid product development, precise product delivery, and efficient production, which ultimately improves the probability of technical and regulatory success of our product candidates.
Our five core capabilities include:
1.Disease Models. We have internalized the ability to create and integrate proprietary in vitro and in vivo models within our research organization, as existing models of human heart disease may not be adequate to assess the efficacy or safety of novel therapies. Our disease modelling capabilities serve to facilitate the discovery of new leads and to characterize the activity of existing leads as we move through preclinical development. For our in vitro human iPSC-CM disease models, we use multiple methods to induce phenotypes within cell lines that simulate human diseases and then use these models for high throughput target identification and drug discovery. For our in vivo disease models, we have a dedicated onsite in vivo pharmacology group and vivarium, where we have established approximately 17 rodent heart disease models, both genetic and non-genetic, and can dose animals, perform heart surgeries, and use non-invasive imaging to assess the impact of our therapies under development. 
 2.Capsid Engineering. We have established in-house AAV capsid engineering capabilities and have successfully screened over one billion variants from more than 30 diverse, proprietary AAV libraries in multiple in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models to discover novel AAV capsids that can target the different types of cells in the heart. We have generated preclinical data to support the superiority of these capsids over parental variants in multiple species against multiple attributes to assess their potential to translate across species and into humans. Our next-generation capsids are designed to have desirable properties including the ability to more selectively target the heart versus other organs, as well as lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. We believe our capsid engineering efforts will be critical in supporting the successful clinical development of future product candidates and enabling those product candidates, if approved, to reach more patients. 
 3.Promoters and Regulatory Elements. We have created novel promoters and regulatory elements that support our gene therapy and cellular regeneration programs by controlling the expression of genes 


within the cells. We use these innovations to help ensure more precise and more robust expression of therapeutic payloads in the different cell types of the heart as compared to what can be achieved with currently available methods. We believe our innovations can support successful clinical development in part by improving the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates.
4.Drug Delivery. We are actively exploring different routes of administration (ROAs) as well as different infusion- and injection-based methods for delivering our AAV-based therapies. We have designed a new catheter to support more targeted delivery and more efficient uptake of therapeutic payloads in the heart. We believe our discoveries in drug delivery can help widen the therapeutic index of our product candidates by reducing the dose required for a therapeutic benefit. 
 5.Manufacturing. We have internalized and integrated both cGMP and non-GMP AAV manufacturing capabilities to support our emerging portfolio of gene therapy and cellular regeneration product candidates. This includes an in-house team of approximately 45 personnel that can support process development, analytical development, quality control (QC) and GMP manufacturing. In addition, we have established a Quality Management System to oversee our GxP operations, including cGMP, GLP and Good Clinical Practices (GCP). To date, we have produced non-clinical material involving multiple parental AAV capsids at the 50L and 200L scales to support early research and IND-enabling studies in small and large animal models, as well as clinical material at the 1000L scale to support our first-in-human clinical studies. Our GMMC, a cGMP facility, is strategically located near our research labs in the San Francisco Bay Area to enable smooth scale-up of production to support our clinical studies. We have both in-licensed and internally developed manufacturing technologies to support programs emerging from our Gene Therapy and Cellular Regeneration Platforms.
 Overview of Heart Disease
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world, representing an estimated 32% of all global fatalities. In the U.S., more than 30 million adults, or approximately 12% of the adult population, are diagnosed with heart disease. In addition, an adult dies from a cardiovascular-related health condition, such as a heart attack every 34 seconds, a gruesome statistic that translates to approximately one in five deaths in the U.S.  The picture is equally bleak at the other end of the age spectrum, as approximately 40,000 infants are born in the U.S. every year with congenital heart disease, the leading cause of birth defect-related morbidity and mortality. There are over 250 known genetically defined disorders where the primary source of morbidity and mortality involves the heart, but there are few approved products that target the underlying genetic causes of such heart diseases. Recent analysis has shown that after decades of reduction in the mortality rate due to heart failure, these rates are once again rising, highlighting the need for improved treatments.
The heart is a complex organ due to its biological structure as well as its tightly regulated and coordinated electrophysiological and biomechanical properties. Heart disease comes in many forms, affects individuals at many ages, and is a result of many factors. As depicted in the below table, heart disease can be generally categorized as either directly resulting from problems associated with the heart organ, for example, heart failure, arrhythmia and heart valve disease; or indirectly resulting from problems associated with the vasculature, for example, coronary artery disease (CAD). In each case, the underlying cause could be genetic, or due to normal aging or due to environmental factors.

The table below illustrates four broad categories of heart disease:


CATEGORIES | DESCRIPTION 
Heart Failure | Heart failure is a heart condition in which the heart’s pumping capacity is not adequate to meet the demands for blood and oxygen required by the rest of the body. Heart failure can be the result of a range of conditions that lead to weakening of the heart muscle. Conditions that can be associated with the development of heart failure include a heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pressure, congenital heart defects, and genetic cardiomyopathies.


Arrhythmia | Arrhythmia is one of the most common heart conditions and is described as any change in the heart’s normal electrical impulses. Electrical impulses from within the heart initiate each heartbeat and ensure its normal pumping function. Arrhythmias can cause the heart to beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly, resulting in a broad range of symptoms as well as sudden death and stroke.
Heart Valve Disease | Heart value disease occurs when there is a problem with one or more of the four valves that normally work in unison to make sure that blood is pumped in the proper direction through the four chambers of the heart. 
Coronary Artery Disease | CAD is among the most common type of heart disease and occurs when plaque grows in the walls of the coronary arteries, limiting the blood flow to the heart’s muscle. CAD can ultimately lead to a heart attack. 

 While there is significant unmet need in the field of heart disease, historically there have been challenges in developing novel therapies for the different forms of heart disease. We are currently focused on heart failure and arrhythmia, particularly when these diseases can be traced to some underlying genetic defect.
Historic Challenges in the Development of Novel Therapies for Heart Disease
•Most development efforts have focused on treating symptoms rather than targeting the underlying causes of diseases. First-line therapies for heart failure such as generic small molecules, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and diuretics, act by reducing blood pressure or fluids to mitigate disease symptoms rather than altering the course of disease. 
 •Identifying relevant disease-modifying targets is challenging. There is a high reliance on animal models that are not always predictive of human heart disease. There is only an approximately 5% overall probability of successful drug development from Phase 1 through commercialization for heart disease, among the lowest of all therapeutic areas. 
 •Genetic diagnosis and genetic counseling are limited. Most patients presenting with heart disease do not currently obtain a genetic test as part of their diagnosis. Given there are almost no therapies that are targeted at the underlying genetic cause of the disease, physicians may believe a genetic test will not influence treatment and management decisions. Additionally, even when patients do receive a genetic diagnosis, genetic counseling and family screening are not commonly employed. As a result, family members who may be at risk of disease are not consistently identified. This lack of genetic testing also limits the availability of patients for clinical trials of genetic medicines in heart disease. 
 •Regenerative therapy science is still in its early stages. Historical attempts at developing cell and gene therapies for heart disease have not been successful. Much effort was devoted to regenerative medicine approaches using autologous (from self) or allogeneic (from donors) cell sources, but after more than 150 clinical studies involving thousands of patients over the last two decades, those efforts have mostly ended in failure. Factors that likely contributed to these failures include (1) an insufficient number of 


new cells surviving rejection by the immune system, (2) only modest efficacy from the surviving cells, and (3) arrhythmia caused by abnormal electric activity and connections between new cells and the existing cells.
 •Gene therapy science for the heart is still maturing. Early gene therapy efforts, including an AAV-based effort using AAV1 to deliver sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) for the treatment of heart failure saw promising preclinical and early clinical results, but were stymied following unsuccessful later-stage studies. These first-generation gene therapy efforts for the heart did not have the benefit of more recent advances in capsids, promoters, delivery, and manufacturing. More recent efforts directed at rare, genetic cardiomyopathies have provided encouraging early clinical evidence of disease-modification. 
 •Regulatory requirements focus on survival and hospitalization outcomes. Historically, cardiovascular drug development has involved large clinical studies to demonstrate a survival benefit or reductions in hospitalizations over and above standard-of-care. This has translated into a need for very large, long, and expensive randomized and placebo-controlled clinical studies. Only more recently has the FDA indicated a willingness to consider endpoints demonstrating measurable improvements in symptoms and heart function as being potentially approvable for certain types of heart diseases, including HCM.
 •Costs of development are high. In part due to the historical need for very large clinical studies, drug development for new therapies of heart disease has been very long and expensive. A recent analysis demonstrated that, on average, biopharmaceutical companies spent $1 billion in clinical development per cardiovascular drug product approval, the highest ratio among all therapeutic areas. 
 •Patient access barriers are challenging. In addition to being a leading cause of death, heart disease is one of the largest and most expensive categories for payers. The U.S. spends approximately $219 billion per year on cardiovascular disease. The total direct and indirect costs of heart failure are expected to increase to $70 billion by 2030. As a result, heart disease is an area of focus for cost-containment and price sensitivity for new therapies for both private and public payers. 
 These factors have contributed to a decline in successful heart disease drug development. Between 2000 and 2009, FDA approvals for new cardiovascular drug products declined by approximately 33% compared with the prior decade. While heart disease is a leading cause of death in the world, fewer resources have been mobilized in support of new therapies for heart disease relative to investment in other therapeutic areas, such as oncology and diseases of the central nervous system.
However, there are recent signs of improvement. There is increasing insight into the genetic causes of heart disease and a greater push for more consistent genetic testing and family counseling supported by (1) updated clinical practice guidelines such as 2020 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommendations for patients with HCM, (2) the push by patient advocacy organizations for mandatory screening of young athletes, and (3) increased availability of accessible genetic testing covering more than 150 relevant genes associated with inherited arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy conditions. There are also a small but growing number of examples of clinical success with precision medicine approaches in cardiology, including in genetic cardiomyopathies. In addition, the FDA continues to issue important guidance to help streamline the development of gene therapies and mitigate safety and tolerability concerns that can delay the drug development timeline.


We believe with the evolving understanding of heart disease in the scientific community and the general public, there are significant opportunities where we can benefit from and support the evolution towards more precise diagnosis, drug development, and treatment for heart disease, as depicted in the diagram below.



Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading, fully integrated biotechnology company delivering next-generation therapies that address the underlying causes of heart disease identified through our multi-modality product platforms. We are taking advantage of an expanded understanding of heart biology and advances in the science of genetics and disease models to discover, develop, manufacture and ultimately commercialize a deep and diverse pipeline of novel heart disease therapies. The key components of our strategy to achieve these goals are:
 •Focus exclusively on heart disease. Heart disease remains a leading cause of death globally, and the unmet medical need remains high. We see significant opportunity to address this sizable market with our dedicated strategy. The heart is a complex organ to target, in part due to the tightly regulated and coordinated electrophysiological and biomechanical properties that can complicate delivery of effective therapies and necessitates a deep understanding of heart biology. Our laser focus leads to insights that underpin our foundational and differentiated capabilities to address challenges that have historically presented barriers to the successful development of novel therapies for the heart. 
 •Develop disease-modifying therapies. We are focused on developing disease-modifying and potentially life-saving novel therapies that target the underlying causes of heart disease. We are particularly interested in areas where there is no current standard-of-care or where we believe the nature and the magnitude of the effect of our therapies will be significant relative to existing standards-of-care. For example, we believe our AAV-based gene therapies for genetically defined conditions have the potential to be curative after a single dose. 
 
•Discover novel therapies using integrated product platforms. To address the wide range of issues in heart diseases, we are advancing science from three distinct product platforms that tackle different problems that have historically plagued drug development in the field of cardiology: (i) our Gene Therapy platform enables the development and delivery of a wide variety of therapeutic payloads more precisely to heart tissue, (ii) our Cellular Regeneration platform enables the replacement of heart cells lost to disease and (iii) our Precision Medicine platform enables the discovery of targeted therapies in a modality-agnostic fashion. Underpinning these platforms is a suite of bespoke internal core capabilities designed to increase the speed with which we can conduct discovery, improve the precise delivery of drug products to the tissues where they can have the desired effect while maximizing safety and productivity. These platforms represent distinct but interrelated product engines that we believe will enable a robust pipeline of promising product candidates while also mitigating overall scientific risk. 


•Target defined sub-populations of patients most likely to respond to our therapies. We seek to focus on patient populations where the genetic cause of the disease is well-established, including genetic cardiomyopathies and other monogenic disorders. We also seek to use different strategies to sub-segment larger heart failure populations, such as HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), through the use of genetics or biomarkers to improve selection of patients with attributes that are more suited to the specific mechanism of action of a given therapeutic candidate. We believe this strategy can accelerate clinical development, reduce overall development costs, and improve the probability of clinical and regulatory success.
 •Internalize and integrate core capabilities to support our innovation. We have five core capabilities that we believe will enable us to rapidly discover, develop, and deliver heart therapies. These capabilities include: (i) Disease Models, (ii) Capsid Engineering, (iii) Promoter and Regulatory Elements, (iv) Drug Delivery and (v) Manufacturing. We believe the integration of our know-how and innovations in these areas will allow us to generate scientific insights more rapidly and improve the probability of technical and regulatory success of our product candidates. The internalization of these capabilities also reduces our reliance on third parties—be it academic labs, contract research organizations (CROs), or contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs)—providing us better control of our timelines and costs. 
 •Advance a deep and diverse pipeline of therapies. The diversity of our programs illustrates the ambition of our vision and the versatility and depth of our scientific approach. We are currently advancing therapeutics for both rare and prevalent heart diseases across multiple treatment modalities. Our most advanced rare disease programs include two AAV-based gene therapy candidates: TN-201, our product candidate for MYBPC3-associated HCM and TN-401, our product candidate for PKP2-associated ARVC. We are also advancing TN-301, a small molecule inhibitor of HDAC6 intended to address HFpEF. Following closely at the candidate selection stage is a DWORF gene therapy for the potential treatment of DCM and a cellular reprogramming program for cardiac regeneration which aims to replace heart cells lost in patients experiencing heart failure due to prior MI. We are also working on several other early-stage programs, that we believe will add to our future pipeline opportunities. 
 •Seek partnerships that can expand our reach and accelerate our efforts. We believe our singular focus on heart disease and extensive platform and core capabilities make us a potential partner of choice for academics and larger companies alike who wish to access deep expertise in next-generation therapies for heart disease. We also strategically evaluate collaborations and partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies that may have more robust and complimentary capabilities and resources to accelerate the development and maximize the availability and potential of our product candidates, particularly for more prevalent indications.
 •Become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with commercial capabilities. We aim to discover, develop, manufacture, and eventually commercialize therapies, with an initial focus on those therapies for rare disease populations that could be marketed by a relatively small salesforce. 
 Our Programs
TN-201: Gene Therapy for MYBPC3-associated HCM
We are developing TN-201, an investigational and potential first-in-class gene therapy for MYBPC3-associated HCM. MYBPC3 genetic mutations are the most common cause of familial HCM, estimated to affect more than 115,000 patients in the U.S. These mutations can cause the heart walls of affected individuals to become significantly thickened, leading to fibrosis, abnormal heart rhythms, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure, and increased risk of sudden cardiac death. TN-201 is an AAV-based gene therapy designed to deliver a fully functional MYBPC3 gene to restore normal levels of the cardiac MyBP-C protein and in order to halt disease progression and reverse the course of genetic HCM after a single treatment. Based on publicly available information we believe TN-201 has the potential to be the first treatment to address the underlying genetic cause of this disease.


Overview of HCM
 
HCM is a condition in which the heart walls become thickened (hypertrophy), resulting in a reduced ability of the LV to relax and fill (diastole) and pump (systole) blood effectively with each contraction. HCM is a chronic, progressive disease associated with significant impairment to patients’ overall quality of life, as well as an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea), fainting (syncope), fatigue and palpitations. As the disease progresses, patients may suffer premature death due to end-stage heart failure or malignant ventricular arrhythmia (VA) sometimes leading to sudden cardiac death or stroke. Disease onset can occur at any age, with HCM most frequently emerging in adults in their mid-40s. When HCM emerges in children and young adults, disease course is typically more aggressive and prognosis is worse than that observed in older patients. While a relatively rare occurrence, HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults.

HCM is estimated to affect one in every 500 people, approximating more than 600,000 people in the U.S. A majority of HCM patients are currently undiagnosed, with diagnosis typically starting with the onset of symptoms, family screening, or the discovery of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern. A clinical diagnosis of HCM in adults is defined as a left ventricular wall thickening of greater than 15mm. Patients with HCM can present with either the obstructive form (oHCM) or the nonobstructive form (nHCM) of the disease. Both forms of the disease involve significant LV hypertrophy; however, in oHCM, the thickening of the LV wall is such that the LV outflow tract (LVOT) narrows and “obstructs” the proper flow of blood to the rest of the body. Nonobstructive HCM is more frequently characterized by diastolic dysfunction resulting in increased LV filling pressures that leads to chest pain and dyspnea.
 
An example of a heart from a patient who had oHCM is shown below, characterized by LV hypertrophy, high LV mass, LVOT narrowing, an overall small LV, and fibrosis.



The genetic causes of HCM may be diverse, but approximately 60% of patients with HCM have clearly identifiable familial disease with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. To date, more than 2,000 mutations in eleven or more genes have been linked to HCM. Those with sarcomeric genetic mutations, including the MYBPC3 gene, are at increased risk of early disease onset, accelerated disease progression and disease-related mortality. Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene are the most common cause of HCM, estimated to represent approximately 19% of the overall HCM population and to affect approximately 115,000 patients in the U.S.
The MYBPC3 gene encodes the MyBP-C protein, which forms a key component of the cardiac sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of the cardiomyocyte. MyBP-C protein is central to regulation of both contraction and relaxation of the cardiac muscle. MYBPC3 gene mutations result in both oHCM and nHCM, with one study involving a series of more than 1000 patients finding that 69% of patients with truncating MYBPC3 mutations had nHCM, while 31% presented with LVOT characteristic of oHCM. The schematic below illustrates the cellular localization of MyBP-C within the heart. Cardiomyocytes contain multiple myofibrils, which are comprised of myofilaments containing many sarcomeres. The sarcomeres contain thin filaments containing actin and thick

filaments containing myosin; the myosin head binds and pulls actin like a hand on a rope and thus supports normal muscle contraction.
 


The reduced MyBP-C protein levels associated with heterozygous mutations in the MYBPC3 gene result in increased activity of the myosin contractile machinery, which over time leads to LV muscle thickening, known as hypertrophy, excess deposition of extracellular matrix in the cardiac muscle, known as fibrosis, and disorganized muscle cells. As a result, the LV wall stiffens, and the chamber is reduced in size, decreasing the heart’s ability to pump. The contractile strength of the muscle declines in some cases, resulting in LV systolic dysfunction, which ultimately can necessitate advanced therapies, such as an LV assist device (LVAD) or transplantation, in the most severely affected patients. Fibrosis and muscle cell disarray may also lead to arrhythmias in some patients, including life-threatening VA and atrial fibrillation, which can lead to stroke.
Infants with homozygous MYBPC3 gene mutations represent a particularly severe patient group with high risk of death within a year after birth without heart transplantation. With no ability to produce MyBP-C protein and no available treatment to address the underlying genetic mutation, the only option for this young patient population is a heart transplant.
 HCM patients who are heterozygous for MYBPC3 gene mutations are typically diagnosed earlier in life, have more severe disease associated with increases in arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular mortality as compared to genotype negative HCM patients.
Analysis of the hearts of patients who carry truncation mutations of the MYBPC3 gene show on average an approximately 40% reduction in the level of functional MyBP-C protein. In the most severe cases in which both copies of the gene are affected, there is a complete lack of functional MyBP-C protein expression. We believe these findings support the idea that mutations of the MYBPC3 gene cause human disease through haploinsufficiency, and also support the hypothesis that gene replacement may address the underlying cause of disease by increasing the levels of functional MyBP-C protein.
The current goal of HCM treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent sudden cardiac death in people at high risk. In current guideline-directed care, patients are typically prescribed one or more symptomatic therapies, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and antiarrhythmics. These therapies do not address the underlying genetic cause of HCM and do not appear to affect disease progression. No randomized clinical trials have assessed these therapies specifically in HCM. The standards of care are slightly different for patients with oHCM versus nHCM, but the unmet need is high in both forms of the disease. Cardioverter-defibrillators may be implanted for patients at high risk for malignant arrhythmias and sudden death. For a subset of oHCM patients with severe and disabling disease, invasive interventions, such as myectomy and septal ablation in which portions of the enlarged septum are removed, may be appropriate. For patients with severe nHCM implantation of an LVAD or a heart transplant may be the only options.
 In recent years, a class of agents known as myosin inhibitors have emerged as potential treatments for oHCM and nHCM. One of these agents, mavacamten, was approved by the FDA in April 2022 for the treatment of oHCM. Other agents continue to be evaluated in clinical studies. Currently, there are no therapies approved or in clinical development specifically for HCM patients with MYBPC3 gene mutations.

Our Solution
We are developing TN-201, a potential first-in-class AAV-based gene therapy designed to deliver a fully functional MYBPC3 gene and to restore normal levels of MyBP-C protein, driven by our proprietary cardiac specific promoter. We believe TN-201 has the potential to address the underlying biological basis of disease in adult and pediatric HCM patients with homozygous or heterozygous MYBPC3 gene mutations.
Based on our preclinical data, we believe that gene therapy can achieve highly selective and robust expression of the MYBPC3 gene and has the potential to slow or even reverse the course of MYBPC3-associated HCM, including LV hypertrophy, outflow tract obstruction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and malignant arrhythmias. By improving upon these aspects of disease, TN-201 may improve heart functional capacity, stabilize or reverse disease symptoms, reduce the need for invasive treatments and improve survival. As with other AAV-based gene therapies, benefits are expected to be durable and a one-time dose may be sufficient for disease stabilization and potentially reversal.
TN-201 Clinical Development Plan
In January 2023, we received clearance of our IND from the FDA to conduct a Phase 1b clinical trial of TN-201 in symptomatic adults with the nonobstructive form of MYBPC3-associated HCM. We expect to commence patient dosing in the Phase 1b in the third quarter of 2023 and have completed all necessary manufacturing of TN-201 to supply the clinical trial.
 The TN-201 Phase 1b is a multi-center, open-label clinical trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-201. The trial will seek to enroll at least six symptomatic (New York Heart Association class II or III) adults (ages 18-65) with low tiers of AAV9 neutralizing antibodies who have been diagnosed with MYBPC3-associated nHCM and have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The primary endpoints for the trial include safety and tolerability, PK (as measured by transgene and mRNA expression via cardiac biopsies at 8 weeks and 52 weeks) and PD (as measured by imaging and plasma biomarkers). Additional endpoints include exercise capacity (as measured by a six-minute walk test and peak maximal oxygen consumption (VO2)) and patient-reported outcomes (as measured by a Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire). The trial will include a preventative immunosuppressive regimen and close safety monitoring, as well as a 5-year follow-up on safety and efficacy. We expect to assess two dose levels of TN-201 in the trial, starting with 3×1013 vg/kg, a dose associated with near-maximal efficacy in preclinical studies. Three patients are expected to be enrolled in the first dose cohort and will be dosed sequentially, with a pause between patient doses to monitor for safety. An independent safety review following the initial cohort will inform plans for dose escalation to 6×10 vg/kg, as needed, and/or enrollment of additional patients in the initial cohort. TN-201 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and orphan medicinal product designation from the EC. Data from the trial is anticipated in 2024.
The Phase 1b clinical trial will be conducted at multiple centers in the U.S. In order to support our development efforts for TN-201, we have initiated two noninterventional studies: a study evaluating seroprevalence to AAV9 antibodies among adults with MYBPC3-associated HCM, and MyClimb, a prospective and retrospective global natural history study focused on pediatric patients with MYBPC3 mutation-associated cardiomyopathy. The objective of the natural history study is to characterize the outcomes, burden of illness, risk factors, quality of life, and biomarkers associated with disease progression in pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy due to MYBPC3 gene mutations, as well as treatments, procedures, and patient outcomes. This study complements existing disease registries focused primarily on adult patient HCM populations and may support and expedite the development of TN-201 in the pediatric patient population. We have activated more than 15 sites in the U.S. and Europe and enrolled more than 100 subjects in the MyClimb study.
Preclinical Evidence Supporting TN-201 Clinical Development Plan
 In preclinical studies, we systemically administered a mouse surrogate of TN-201 (AAV:mMybpc3 or mTN-201) in two-week-old Mybpc3 KO mice. The Mybpc3 KO model develops marked LV hypertrophy, poor cardiac function, and dilation at two-weeks of age, comparable to HCM patients with truncating or null mutations. Due to the severe phenotype of the Mybpc3 KO mice and the lack of any MyBP-C protein, this is considered a demanding model to demonstrate efficacy particularly for modeling heterozygous patients, who lack only 35% to 40% of normal sarcomeric MyBP-C protein levels. As shown in the figures below, treatment with mTN-201 improved LV hypertrophy and cardiac function compared to their pre-treatment baseline levels, indicating partial reversal of the disease and dramatically extended lifespan. Treated mice exhibited an absolute improvement of EF of more than

20% versus untreated controls that eventually increases to more than 30% at 13 months, the last echocardiography measurement. EF and LV hypertrophy (LV mass normalized to body weight (BW)) improvements did not diminish over time, suggesting that a single systemic dose may be sufficient for a durable reversal of MYBPC3-associated HCM. Additionally, we observed improvements in LV diameter and ECG measurements. There is also a clear survival benefit with 100% survival in the mTN-201 arm and 100% mortality in the untreated control arm out to 18 months following dosing.





In addition, a dose-response relationship has been demonstrated with mTN-201. As shown below, 1×1013 vg/kg, 3×10 vg/kg and 1×10 vg/kg weight-based doses all produced significant improvements in EF, LV hypertrophy, and measures of electrophysiological function (QT interval) at eight months post-injection in the Mybpc3 KO HCM mouse model. The 1×1013 vg/kg dose had the lowest levels of efficacy, while the 3×10 vg/kg had high improvement in the EF, similar to the 1×10 vg/kg dose, suggesting a plateau in the dose-response curve. A similar dose response has also been observed with TN-201 in the Mybpc3 KO mouse model.



  In our preclinical studies with the Mybpc3 KO model, we have not observed MyBP-C protein levels substantially above normal levels, suggesting that protein accumulation does not occur and lowers the potential concern of overexpression-related toxicities. In addition, histological assessments of mTN-201 treated Mybpc3 KO model murine hearts support the uniform and robust distribution of expression following mTN-201 infusion, suggesting gene therapy may be able to replace the missing MYBPC3 gene uniformly across the heart. This observation is consistent with heart biopsy samples from patients treated with other AAV9-based gene therapies in development.


The figure below demonstrates a restoration of MyBP-C protein levels to wildtype levels within two weeks following a single dose of mTN-201 at the 3×10 vg/kg and 1×10 vg/kg dose levels.

Consistent with observed therapeutic benefit, treatment of the Mybpc3 KO mice with mTN-201 is also associated with a substantial reduction of expression of genes associated with fibrosis and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a circulating factor associated with cardiac wall stress.
The figures below show dose-dependent inhibition of expression of genes associated with cardiac strain (Nppa, Nppb, and Myh7) and fibrosis (Col1a1, Col4a1, and Postn) following a single dose of mTN-201 at the 1×1013 vg/kg and 3×1013 vg/kg dose levels.

Treatment with either TN-201 or mTN-201 in the Mybpc3 KO model was not associated with significant BW differences, clinical observations, or differences in histopathological assessments across dose levels. In addition, no impact on BW was observed at dose levels between 3×10 vg/kg and 6×10 vg/kg in pilot safety studies in wildtype neonatal mice twelve weeks after dosing.
Differentiating Characteristics for TN-201
 During optimization of our MYBPC3 gene therapies, we discovered a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter, TNP-CM1, with improved performance attributes as compared to the standard cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter. In vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed that TNP-CM1 significantly increased expression of the MYBPC3 gene compared to what can be achieved with the standard cTnT promoter. See “Business—Our Core Capabilities—3. Promoters and Regulatory Elements.” TNP-CM1 has been tested in a human iPSC-CM disease model, in multiple murine models, and in non-human primates (NHPs). As demonstrated below, our proprietary cassette significantly improved heart function in our Mybpc3 KO mouse model in comparison to a published construct containing a standard cTnT promoter and utilizing the same AAV capsid. These data are also significant as the Mybpc3 KO models were treated at three months of age (rather than two weeks) suggesting that it is possible to reverse cardiac dysfunction even after significant onset of disease.



TN-301: HDAC6 Inhibitor Program for HFpEF
We are developing an HDAC6 small molecule inhibitor for the potential treatment of HFpEF. HFpEF is one of the greatest areas of unmet need in heart disease with more than three million patients in the U.S. and currently no approved disease-modifying therapies. A complex syndrome, the causes of HFpEF are diverse, but result in a shared pathophysiology with systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction leading to hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction among other characteristic consequences. The result is high morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Our product candidate, TN-301, is a differentiated compound with unique chemical structures and high specificity for HDAC6 and based on publicly available information to date, we believe, is the first HDAC6i being developed for HFpEF.
Overview of HFpEF
HFpEF is generally defined as heart failure with an EF greater than or equal to 50%. In patients with HFpEF, the LV is stiffened and does not adequately relax, and increased pressure is needed for the ventricle to properly fill. As a result, blood begins to build up inside the left atrium of the heart and eventually swells into the lungs, veins and tissues of the body. HFpEF is a progressive disease in many patients. Symptoms initially include fatigue, shortness of breath, and tissue swelling, resulting in reduced physical activity. Over time, this results in a substantial limitation in activities and impact on quality of life, and patients are at risk of premature death.
 Patients with HFpEF represent approximately half of heart failure patients, with prevalence of the disease anticipated to increase by more than 45% by 2030. The increase in HFpEF prevalence is at least in part due to the high overlap of this condition with diabetes and obesity which are also on the rise in the U.S. and globally. At least half of all hospital admissions for heart failure are related to HFpEF and approximately 24% of the HFpEF

population is considered to have New York Heart Association Class III or Class IV disease, representing a disease burden that markedly impacts quality of life and limits physical activity. Among patients hospitalized for HFpEF, readmission for heart failure and mortality rates over a five-year period are as high as 40% and 75%, respectively.
Despite limited data demonstrating efficacy in the HFpEF setting, patients generally receive therapies prescribed for HFrEF, including diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Patients with HFpEF are generally not responsive to therapies that have been shown to improve outcomes of patients with HFrEF. Without the development of more effective therapies specifically for HFpEF patients, disease management is mostly directed toward treating associated conditions and symptoms. Recently, a class of glucose lowering drugs known as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging evidence of reducing hospitalizations and mortality versus placebo in HFpEF patients, with one such agent approved by the FDA for the treatment of HFpEF. In spite of this recent progress, HFpEF remains one of the greatest unmet needs in cardiovascular medicine.
Our Solution
 We are developing TN-301, a highly specific small molecule inhibitor of HDAC6 for the potential treatment of HFpEF. HDAC6 is localized to the cell cytoplasm where it interacts with multiple proteins to coordinate cellular processes. In animal models intended to mimic human HFpEF, our highly selective HDAC6 inhibitors reversed preexisting cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, and improved lung congestion and exercise capacity, all of which are hallmarks of HFpEF.
TN-301 and our related HDAC6 inhibitors were discovered using our distinct Precision Medicine targeted drug discovery platform technologies, involving phenotypic screening and deep learning to human iPSCs. In vitro, our HDAC6 inhibitors demonstrated up to 2500-fold preferential selectivity for HDAC6, reduced sarcomeric damage and enhanced cardiac energetics. In in vivo studies in multiple mouse models of HFpEF, TN-301 and TYA-018, a structurally and functionally equivalent compound used for preclinical testing, demonstrated reductions in inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, as well as decreased fibrosis, hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. In a comparison study with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, which is approved by the FDA in 2022 for the treatment of HFpEF, both TN-301 and TYA-018 improved glucose tolerance, reduced LV mass and end diastolic pressure and increased diastolic function with comparable efficacy, providing validation for our proprietary HFpEF mouse model and suggesting that preclinical results may translate to the clinic.
TN-301 Clinical Development Plan
 We are conducting a randomized (3:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating oral doses of TN-301 in healthy adult participants. Secondary objectives of the clinical trial will be to assess PK and PD measures. The trial is being conducted in two stages. In the first stage, participants receive single ascending doses of either TN-301 or placebo and based on data from the SAD stage of the trial, including PD evidence of target engagement, participants in the second stage receive multiple ascending doses of TN-301 at dose levels of interest to help guide dosing in future trials. Dosing in the SAD stage of the trial began in September 2022. To date, TN-301 has been generally well tolerated. Initial target engagement (as measured by the PD biomarker of tubulin acetylation) was achieved at dose levels thought to be in therapeutic ranges, enabling the initiation of the MAD stage of the clinical trial, which commenced in February 2023. Data from both the SAD and MAD stages of the trial are anticipated in the second half of 2023.
Preclinical Evidence Supporting TN-301 Clinical Development
 Treatment with TN-301 has reversed measures of HFpEF, including heart filling defects known as diastolic dysfunction, in multiple animal models. In one HFpEF model developed in-house, we surgically applied moderate aortic banding (mTAC) in wild type mice fed a high fat diet for eight weeks. These interventions induced a cardio-metabolic heart failure phenotype that simulated the systemic and cardiovascular features of HFpEF in humans. Aspects of the HFpEF phenotype included increased LV wall thickness, LV hypertrophy, increased diastolic pressure, impaired LV relaxation and filling, and glucose intolerance, while maintaining EF at or above 50%.
After the HFpEF phenotypes were established, animals were dosed orally with TN-301 or vehicle for six weeks. As illustrated below, TN-301 treatment reversed HFpEF disease phenotype across all studied parameters, including restoration of LV wall thickness, LV end diastolic pressure, LV relaxation and filling, and LV mass,

compared to control. In addition, as shown below, the treated mice exhibited a clear trend of decreased lung weight, indicative of improvement in pulmonary congestion consistent with the reduction of filling pressure.

   

In addition, as illustrated below, in multiple studies in HFpEF models, we have also observed an improvement in glucose tolerance suggesting that treatment with a selective HDAC6i may have a positive impact on glucose metabolism.



Consistent with the observed improvement in HFpEF phenotype, TN-301 treatment in this HFpEF model was also associated with reductions of key biomarkers of fibrosis, hypertrophy and cardiac damage, and inflammation in heart samples compared to levels observed in control animals, as shown in the figure below:




Comparison with SGLT2 Inhibitors
 In order to validate our proprietary murine model of HFpEF we evaluated the efficacy of TYA-018 in comparison with empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of HFpEF. HFpEF was induced with a combination of transaortic constriction and DIO to simulate a HFpEF phenotype. Maximally efficacious doses of TYA-018, empagliflozin or vehicle were administered for nine-weeks and compared.
  In this model, empagliflozin behaved as anticipated based on the data generated from large clinical trials: fasting glucose and glucose tolerance were improved, and LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction were reduced. TYA-018 demonstrated comparable benefits across multiple measures, including improvements in glucose tolerance, LV mass, LV end diastolic function and diastolic pressure.


TYA-018 also demonstrated superiority in improving markers of cardiac stress, reducing inflammatory markers and improving mitochondrial energy.

Taken together, data from our preclinical comparison studies elucidate the differentiated mechanism of action for HDAC6 inhibition and support the potential of our HDAC6 inhibition preclinical data to translate to the clinic.

PD Biomarker: Measurement of Target Engagement
 HDAC6 is a cytoplasmic enzyme and one of its main substrates is tubulin. Increase in acetylated tubulin is a robust and reproducible PD marker with a high dynamic range that can be measured in both the heart and in circulating cells. We have developed an assay suitable for testing PD effect in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that we intend to use to demonstrate proof-of-activity and target engagement in our clinical trials. The figure below illustrates dose-dependent increases in tubulin acetylation levels in the heart of a mouse model following administration of TN-301 (previously referred to as TYA-11631) (left axis), and how tubulin acetylation levels appear to correspond to levels of TN-301 as measured in plasma over time.

As part of our efforts to validate tubulin acetylation as a biomarker for target engagement, we undertook a series of experiments testing the effects of standard-of-care heart failure medication on tubulin acetylation and found that there was no impact, meaning it is a unique PD marker for TN-301.The figure below illustrates dose-dependent increases in tubulin acetylation levels in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, illustrating how this PD biomarker can also be measured in human blood, including in healthy volunteers. This PD assay format is the same as what is being used for testing clinical samples from the TN-301 Phase 1 clinical trial.




Multi-Modal Mechanism of Action in HFpEF
The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HFpEF is an active area of scientific research. Key aspects of HFpEF disease biology include oxidative stress and inflammation, cardiac fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac stiffness, which all result in diastolic dysfunction, and decreased ability of the heart to fill its chambers during contraction. Defects in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and overall defective metabolism have also been proposed to play a role in HFpEF onset and progression due to high overlap in the HFpEF population with diabetes and obesity as comorbidities.
HDAC6 has been generally associated with several of these potential HFpEF mechanisms. Our preclinical data generated to date is consistent with what is known in the published literature and is suggestive of a multi-modal mechanism of action that may address multiple aspects of HFpEF disease. The schematic below shows a conceptual model of HFpEF disease biology highlighting key aspects (the yellow boxes in the figure below) for which there are external and internal data supporting the potential utility of HDAC6 inhibitors, including TN-301, in HFpEF.

   
1.Inflammation / Oxidative stress: In our preclinical studies, TN-301 has shown improvement in inflammatory markers in adipose tissue from a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model, while TYA-018 has shown improvement in inflammatory markers in a BAG3 model of DCM. Published studies have linked inhibition of HDAC6 with inflammasome biology and enhancement of regulatory T cell activity. 
 2.Defective metabolism / glucose metabolism: In our preclinical studies, TN-301 has shown improvement in glucose tolerance in a HFpEF model; dose-dependent improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in a DIO mouse model; and improvement in glucose uptake in iPSC-CMs. TYA-018 has also shown improvement in dysregulated metabolic pathways in a BAG3 model of DCM. In a published 


study, HDAC6 KO mice had a significant improvement in dexamethasone-induced whole-body glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to wildtype mice, suggesting that HDAC6 may be an important regulator of gluconeogenesis and glucose metabolism.
3.Fibrosis: In our preclinical studies, TN-301 significantly improved markers of cardiac fibrosis in a HFpEF model. Published studies support our findings, having shown HDAC6 inhibition by siRNA or partially selective inhibitors attenuated myofibroblast markers and HDAC6 knockdown has been demonstrated to inhibit cardiac fibroblast proliferation. 
 4.
4.Hypertrophy: In our preclinical studies, TN-301 has also shown improved in LV hypertrophy in multiple HFpEF models. In published studies, HDAC inhibitors prevented cardiac hypertrophy in animal models in response to various hypertrophic stimuli, and HDAC inhibition suppressed cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in a model of hypertension through regulation of HDAC6/HDAC8 enzyme activity. 
 5.Impaired autophagy: In our preclinical studies, TYA-018, has shown improvement in autophagy in a BAG3 model of DCM that was correlated with improvement in heart function. Published studies illustrate the role of reduced autophagy in HFpEF and in aging hearts. 
 6.Diastolic dysfunction: TN-301 has also shown improved diastolic dysfunction in multiple preclinical HFpEF models. Published studies have shown pan-HDAC inhibitors improved diastolic dysfunction in two distinct murine models of HFpEF and HDAC inhibition improved cardiopulmonary function in a feline model of diastolic dysfunction. 
 Potential Indications Beyond HFpEF
 Data from preclinical studies evaluating TN-301 as a treatment for HFpEF suggest that there may also be a role for TN-301 in the treatment of sub-populations of HFpEF patients with obesity, diabetes or metabolic syndrome as well as potentially in sub-populations of DCM where there is strong alignment between the multi-modal mechanism of action of TN-301 with the pathophysiology of the disease.
TN-301: Preclinical Studies in Models of Metabolic Disease
In addition to improvements in glucose metabolism associated with TN-301 treatment in HFpEF mouse models, treatment with TN-301 has also led to improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in a DIO mouse model. As shown below, treatment with a single dose of TN-301 improves glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner in the DIO model. Furthermore, TN-301 treatment improves glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner after daily dosing for two weeks and insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner after daily dosing for four weeks.





A single dose treatment of TN-301 in the DIO model is also associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory markers in adipose tissue relative to controls as shown below. Inflammatory biomarkers in adipose tissue are thought to be linked to glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. For example, adipose IL-6 deficiency has been associated with improvements in glucose tolerance. Loss of IL-10 has also been shown to protect mice from DIO and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Collectively, these data are supportive of a role for HDAC6 inhibition on glucose tolerance and insulin resistance with potential applicability to sub-populations of HFpEF patients with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome.


HDAC6 Inhibitors: Preclinical Studies in DCM
Through our target identification Precision Medicine platform, HDAC6 was initially identified as a target for a genetically defined subset of DCM, BAG3 mutant DCM. We screened a large chemical library to identify compounds able to reverse sarcomere defects in BAG3-deficient human iPSC-CMs. Sarcomere defects were rapidly and systemically assessed through our proprietary machine learning algorithms. Whereas a pan-HDAC inhibitor was identified in the initial compound screen as reversing sarcomere defects, we conducted follow-up screens using RNAi knockdowns of HDAC family members to identify HDAC6 as a potential therapeutic target in vitro.
We have validated these in vitro findings by testing our HDAC6i compounds in BAG3 mutant mice models. As shown in the figure below, treatment of a rapidly worsening mouse model of BAG3 mutant DCM with TYA-018 resulted in a greater than 20% improvement in EF after eight weeks of treatment compared to a control group treated with vehicle.




TN-401: Gene Therapy for PKP2-associated ARVC
PKP2 gene mutations are estimated to affect more than 70,000 patients in the U.S. These mutations can cause enlargement of the RV in affected individuals, replacement of heart muscle with fibrotic tissue and fatty deposits, and severely abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) that can make it harder for the heart to function properly and result in sudden cardiac death in some adults and children. Based on publicly available information to date, we believe there are currently no approved treatments that address the underlying genetic cause of this disease. We are developing TN-401, a potential first-in-class AAV-based gene therapy designed to address ARVC caused by PKP2 gene mutations. We have demonstrated prevention of disease progression, reversal of RV remodeling and survival

benefit in a murine model after a single dose. We expect to submit an IND to the FDA in the second half of 2023, and those efforts are being aided by our learnings from the TN-201 IND filing experience.
 Overview of ARVC
 ARVC is largely an inherited disease characterized by the progressive loss of muscle cells in the heart’s RV and replacement with a composite of fibrotic tissue and fatty deposits. As a result of this structural change, the heart becomes dilated and is prone to VA and particularly ventricular tachycardia (abnormally high heart rate).
Patients with ARVC most commonly present with symptoms related to VA (such as palpitations, lightheadedness, and fainting) or cardiac arrest, with the mean age of diagnosis in patients occurring before the age of 40. ARVC is an important cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young patients, and particularly in athletes. The median age at cardiac arrest in ARVC patients is 25 years old. In an effort to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, patients with ARVC are typically discouraged from competitive or endurance sports activities and physical exercise may be limited.
 ARVC has an estimated prevalence in the general population of approximately 1:2000. Mutations in the PKP2 gene are the most common genetic cause of ARVC, with approximately 41% to 46% of ARVC patients carrying pathogenic variants. We therefore estimate more than 70,000 patients in the U.S. are affected by PKP2 mutations. Mutations of the PKP2 gene are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, i.e., a mutation in one gene is sufficient to cause the disease. Over 14 mutations have been linked to the PKP2 gene. Most of these mutations are predicted to result in a truncated protein product, which suggests a disease mechanism due to loss of function, resulting in haploinsufficiency.
As illustrated below, the PKP2 protein is an integral component of cell adhesion protein complexes known as desmosomes which connect adjacent cardiomyocytes in the heart. Desmosomes are responsible for stabilizing the heart and for maintaining channels called gap junctions that allow for cellular communication among heart cells, which in turn is important to proper synchronization of cardiomyocyte contractions across the myocardium contributing to each heartbeat.



The figure below(2) analyzes heart tissue from an ARVC patient with the PKP2 mutation and compares it to the heart tissue from a normal individual. The tissue has been stained for desmosome proteins PKP2 and plakoglobin as well as other transmembrane proteins that are not part of the desmosome, but that are also present at cell-cell junctions in different body organs (e.g., N-cadherin). As illustrated, N-cadherin, PKP2, and plakoglobin are all correctly localized to the junctions between cardiomyocytes in the healthy control sample. However, when the PKP2 gene is mutated, N-cadherin continues to correctly localize, but both the PKP2 and plakoglobin proteins are no longer properly localized to the desmosome. As a result of this impairment, cardiomyocytes can become detached from each other when placed under the normal mechanical stress of the beating heart, or under the extra mechanical stress in the heart caused by athletic activity. This detachment causes cell death, which in turn causes inflammation, scar formation, and fat deposition, illustrating the crucial role the PKP2 protein plays in maintaining the structural integrity of the desmosome, and that mutations in the PKP2 gene are enough to disrupt this complex in human hearts.

An example of a heart from a patient who had ARVC is shown below(3). This illustrates commonly seen abnormalities in ARVC hearts as a result of the improper function of the desmosome, including dilation (enlargement) of the RV chamber and replacement of healthy heart tissue by fibrotic tissue and fatty deposits.



Following a diagnosis, ARVC patients are typically implanted with an ICD to control arrhythmias and prevent sudden cardiac death. ICD implantation is currently the only proven effective treatment for preventing sudden cardiac death in ARVC patients, but ICDs are also associated with complications, including inappropriate shocks, potential for heart perforation and need for additional surgery. Patients may progress to catheter ablation procedures which have a high rate of recurrence of VA and have not been shown to reduce risk of sudden cardiac death or improve survival. Pharmacologic options for ARVC treatment typically include beta blockers and other anti-arrhythmic or heart failure medications, intended to reduce VAs, but studies comparing the efficacy of such treatment have not been conducted. Despite the availability of these treatments, clinical heart failure has been documented in up to 40% of ARVC patients, and when heart transplantation is required, transplants occur at an average age of 40 and within seven years of the onset of heart failure symptoms. There are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying genetic causes of ARVC.

Our Solution
We are developing a potential first-in-class AAV-based gene therapy to deliver a fully functional copy of the human PKP2 gene to the hearts of ARVC patients carrying PKP2 mutations. We believe that delivery of a working PKP2 gene to cardiomyocytes represents a promising treatment that can address the underlying cause of this disease. As the disease is most often caused by haploinsufficiency, expression of a functional PKP2 gene to replace the missing PKP2 protein in cardiomyocytes is expected to restore proper structure and function of the desmosome. This in turn can help prevent adverse heart remodeling and improve heart contraction and electrical function. The PKP2


 gene will be delivered using AAV9 capsid with well-established tropism for the heart and expression of the PKP2 protein will be targeted to the heart through use of a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter.

TN-401 Preclinical Studies
We developed a Pkp2 conditional knockout (Pkp2-cKO) mouse model that simulates key aspects of ARVC including dilation of the RV, decline in LV heart function, severe arrhythmia, abnormal ECG trace, and early mortality. The onset of symptoms in this model is very rapid and occurs within three weeks after induction of the gene deletion. It is worth noting that this Pkp2-cKO model is homozygous, i.e., both copies of the gene are missing and so there is no production of the PKP2 protein. As expected, the severity of disease and the rate of disease progression in this mouse model are both greater than what is normally observed in most PKP2 patients who are almost all heterozygous for PKP2 gene mutations, i.e., they have one normal, healthy copy of the gene that is producing at least some of the necessary PKP2 protein, plus one defective copy of the gene that is either producing no PKP2 protein at all or that is producing PKP2 protein that does not function properly in the desmosome. The Pkp2-cKO model is nonetheless useful as it provides important proof of concept for the potentially beneficial in vivo effect of the PKP2 protein replacement via a gene therapy approach.
In preclinical studies, we systemically administered a mouse surrogate of TN-401 (AAV:mPkp2 or mTN-401) in Pkp2-cKO mice at the 5×10 vg/kg and 1×10 vg/kg dose levels. Data from these studies showed that whether mTN-401 gene therapy was administered at the time of disease onset or following disease progression, several ARVC phenotypes improved compared to saline-treated controls (HBSS), including preventing RV enlargement, preventing decline of LV function, and improving survival after a single IV dose. Further, mTN-401’s beneficial effects have been shown to be durable following a single dose lasting the remainder of the Pkp2-cKO mice model’s natural life span.

We are also encouraged by the preclinical safety profile and dose-responses observed in our studies of Pkp2-cKO mice following treatment with various doses of TN-401. In these studies, we observed dose-dependent efficacy against disease attributes, including prevention of LV functional decline, with relatively low doses achieving near maximal efficacy. Single doses of TN-401 administered in Pkp2-cKO mice at the 1×1013 vg/kg, 3×10 vg/kg and 1×10 vg/kg dose levels were shown to achieve robust protein expression of PKP2 transgene and desmoplakin (DSP). DSP is one of the five protein components of desmosome in addition to PKP2 and its expression in response to TN-401 is an indicator of improved desmosome integrity following PKP2 protein replacement. The specificity of TN-401 for the heart and its therapeutic index have also proven to be promising in our preclinical studies with low tropism for other organs even at doses greater than ten-fold higher than those with near maximal efficacy. Taken

together, we believe these observations position TN-401 well for successful clinical development, with an encouraging safety and efficacy profile.


PD Biomarker: Preventing Ventricular Arrhythmias
 PKP2 gene therapy has been shown preclinically to correct the hallmark electrophysiological defects associated with ARVC. The graphs below show nearly complete prevention of arrhythmia in Pkp2-cKO animals treated with mTN-401 versus controls, including prevention of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). NSVTs and PVCs were reduced to near healthy levels as evidenced by

the ECG trace and the quantification with a Ventricular Arrythmia Score measuring the incidence of spontaneous arrhythmias during 30 minutes of recording.

    
The graphs below show normalization of the QRS complex in Pkp2-cKO animals treated with mTN-401 versus controls, including prevention of QT elongation (as measured by QT interval) and abnormal P wave and R wave amplitudes (as measured by the P/R ratio).



Based on the preclinical evidence that PKP2 gene therapy is able to correct the arrhythmias associated with ARVC, we believe this measurement may provide a meaningful early PD biomarker for monitoring TN-401’s activity in the clinic.
 TN-401 Planned Clinical Development
We have initiated IND-enabling activities and plan to submit an IND to the FDA for TN-401 in the second half of 2023. We intend to use our experience from the TN-201 IND filing and to seek feedback from multiple regulatory agencies, including the FDA, as necessary. If our IND is approved, we plan to initiate global FIH clinical trials in patients with mutations of the PKP2 gene. Additionally, in support of our development efforts for TN-401, we have initiated a global non-interventional study to collect treatment history and seroprevalence to AAV9 antibodies data among ARVC patients who carry pathogenic or likely pathogenic PKP2 gene mutations.

DWORF Program for DCM
 We are developing an AAV-based gene therapy designed to deliver the DWORF gene for patients with DCM.
 Dilated cardiomyopathies are estimated to affect about one million patients in the U.S. DCM is a progressive and life-threatening disease that causes enlargement and wall thinning of the LV, insufficient contraction, reduced blood flow, VA, and can result in premature morbidity and need for heart transplant in affected individuals. DWORF is a muscle-specific micro-peptide that acts on the SERCA2a pathway, widely considered to be a promising target in heart failure. We and our academic collaborators have accumulated significant preclinical proof-of-concept evidence for the therapeutic benefit and tolerability of over-expression of the DWORF gene in multiple murine models, including models of DCM. Based on publicly available information to date, we believe these are the first demonstrations of the potential benefit of AAV:DWORF. This program is currently at the candidate selection stage.
Overview of DCM
DCM is broadly defined as heart failure where the EF is below 40% and the walls of the LV are thin and over-expanded, leading to insufficient contraction, reduced blood flow pumped by the heart, and abnormal heart rhythms. DCM can be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including genetics, CAD, high blood pressure, heart attack, and viral infection.
DCM is a life-threatening and progressive disease. Once symptoms appear, a patient’s condition typically declines progressively. Typical symptoms of heart failure due to DCM include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the extremities, or an irregular heartbeat. As the disease progresses, patients become increasingly debilitated and experience sustained shortness of breath, even at rest. Diastolic function, or the heart’s ability to relax and fill with blood, is also impaired because the heart is already expanded and fibrotic. The dilated LV is deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen that may contribute to further fibrosis and the risk of dangerous heart rhythm disturbances. At any stage of the disease, whether or not symptoms have appeared, DCM patients are at risk of sudden cardiac death.
It is estimated that DCM affects about one million people in the U.S., with genetic abnormalities linked to DCM estimated to be present in about 30% to 40% of DCM patients.
A subset of DCM is caused by genetic mutations in proteins involved in muscle contraction. Mutations in one such protein, phospholamban (PLN), can cause DCM. These mutations are believed to result in abnormal regulation of calcium biology instrumental in muscle contraction, leading to ventricular dilation, fibrosis and heart failure over time. Some patients with PLN mutations have a high severity of disease, including patients with R9C and R14del mutations. PLN mutations are rare with an estimated 0.5% of DCM patients carrying PLN mutations. Notwithstanding, founder effects in certain communities have led to higher concentrations of affected individuals in specific regions in the world, enabling patient identification.
DCM treatment generally utilizes medications developed and approved for HFrEF. While current pharmacologic therapies have improved prognosis and the quality of life of DCM patients, the premature morbidity and mortality rate remains unacceptably high. End-stage DCM is the leading indication for use of last line therapies, including LVADs and heart transplantation. Within five years of diagnosis, 43% of patients with advanced DCM have either died or needed a heart transplant. Thus, there is a large unmet need for targeted, disease-modifying options.
 Our Solution
We have licensed intellectual property from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) to develop and commercialize products relating to therapeutics overexpressing DWORF and are developing an AAV-based gene therapy to deliver the DWORF gene to cardiomyocytes for the treatment of DCM. DWORF is a recently discovered small peptide that localizes primarily to the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the cardiac muscle cell. During muscle cell activation, calcium is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle cell’s cytosol and into the sarcomere, leading to muscle contraction. Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) is a major isoform of SERCA expressed in cardiomyocytes and plays an essential role in the regulation of cardiac contractility. SERCA2a transports calcium from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, preserving the calcium gradient required for contraction. DWORF binds to SERCA2a and displaces the inhibitory PLN peptide, resulting in increased SERCA2a activity, increased levels of calcium pumped into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and increased muscle contraction, ultimately leading to an improvement in heart function.

We believe DWORF is an ideal target for the treatment of particular forms of heart failure. DWORF is a small peptide that is readily expressed when delivered by AAV. The small size of the DWORF gene leaves additional room in the AAV capsid to include optimized combinations of promoters and regulatory elements to tailor DWORF gene expression levels. In addition, published studies have shown that DWORF gene expression is lower in failing human hearts compared to non-diseased hearts.
The figure below shows expression analyses in human heart failure tissue. DWORF mRNA is reduced in failing hearts whereas atrial natriuretic peptide (NPPA) mRNA, a marker of congestive heart failure, is significantly increased in failing hearts.



One therapeutic hypothesis is that restoring DWORF gene expression to normal levels, through treatment with a DWORF gene therapy, may normalize calcium flux in cardiomyocytes and increase contractile strength in DCM patients, as well as the broader HFrEF patient population. In addition, in patients with DCM caused by specific PLN mutations, the mutant PLN peptides are excessively inhibitory to SERCA2a, thereby reducing cardiac contractility. DWORF gene therapy produces DWORF peptides that directly compete with mutant PLN peptides by preferentially binding with SERCA2a, which can increase muscle contraction, potentially halting or even reversing disease progression.
Our DWORF program, illustrated below, is currently at the candidate selection stage with multiple constructs under consideration. DWORF gene expression is limited to the cardiomyocyte through use of a novel cardiomyocyte-specific promoter. Our intended product candidate will use an AAV capsid with high tropism for the heart, either AAV9 or a novel proprietary capsid developed through our capsid engineering capabilities, to deliver the DWORF gene. We are exploring different ROAs including systemic (IV) or delivery directly to the heart through an infusion catheter.



Preclinical Studies

Results in DCM (with Muscle Lim Protein (MLP) KO model): AAV:DWORF constructs have shown improvements in heart remodeling following treatment in mouse models of DCM. As shown below, we have developed multiple proprietary promoters that drive multiple different levels of expression. As shown below, AAV:DWORF constructs containing these promoters (TNP-CM2, TNP-CM4, and TNP-CM7) improved EF relative

to a saline control in the MLP KO mouse model of DCM, with improvements in EF as high as approximately 14% achieved with constructs containing the TNP-CM4 promoter. The increase in heart function was durable throughout the duration of this 24-week study:



AAV9:DWORF also improved exercise capacity, including running distance and time to exhaustion, in the MLP KO DCM mouse model 26 weeks post-treatment.
 

We have tested different AAV:DWORF constructs in both healthy and disease mouse models and have not observed any safety signals at clinically relevant levels of DWORF overexpression.
Planned Clinical Development and Potential Indications Beyond DCM
 After selection of our product candidate, we plan to initiate IND-enabling studies. Should an IND for this program be cleared by the FDA, during clinical development, we plan to examine the role of AAV:DWORF in DCM, as well as potentially in sub-populations of HFrEF where there is alignment between AAV:DWORF with the pathophysiology of the disease. Approximately 50% of heart failure cases are HFrEF, representing a prevalence of nearly four million patients in the U.S. In addition, the incidence and prevalence of HFrEF continues to rise. This increase is driven by an aging population, improved survival from MI and other forms of heart disease, and the increasing prevalence of predisposing risk factors such as diabetes and obesity. HFrEF patients continue to have substantial unmet need despite advances in pharmacological treatments.
Reprogramming Program for Heart Failure due to Prior MI
We are developing an AAV-based approach to cellular regeneration that involves converting (or reprogramming) existing cardiac fibroblasts within the heart to turn into new cardiomyocytes and to replace cells permanently lost due to MI. There are estimated to be more than four million patients in the U.S. living with heart failure due to prior MI. The loss of cardiomyocytes in affected individuals permanently impairs heart contraction, leading to heart failure and potentially fatal arrhythmias, and the death of approximately 5% to 10% of MI survivors within the first year. There are currently no approved treatments that address the underlying loss of heart tissue. The potential utility of our unique approach to creating new cardiomyocytes was first demonstrated by our co-founder Deepak Srivastava, M.D. We have discovered a proprietary combination of three genes that can drive robust in vivo


 reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes when delivered together in a single AAV capsid. Based on publicly available information to date, we believe our results in a pig model of heart failure due to prior MI represent the first-ever successful demonstration of the potential benefit of this approach in a human-sized heart. This program is currently at the candidate selection stage.
Overview of heart failure due to prior MI
CAD is the single most common cause of heart failure and is often associated with an MI, in which blood flow to a section of the heart, usually the LV, becomes limited, causing the cells in that section of the heart, including cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, to die. The heart cannot replace the lost cardiomyocytes while the cardiac fibroblasts multiply significantly, resulting in scar tissue formation and stiffening of the LV walls, leading to progressive and irreversible cardiovascular remodeling. As a result, the heart continues to lose its ability to pump as strongly and may fail over time. In addition to heart failure, these patients also have a persistent risk of arrhythmias and increased likelihood of a second heart attack or sudden death.
In the U.S., greater than 800,000 people have a heart attack every year; of these approximately 200,000 already had a prior heart attack. Approximately 20% of patients age 45 and older will have another heart attack within five years of their first one. Despite advances in treatment options, mortality due to heart attack is still high; data from the U.S. National Vital Statistics Reports shows the median life expectancy among individuals aged 65 to 69 who have had a heart attack is just 8.3 years as compared to 18.7 years among those who have not.
There are no known therapies that address the loss of cardiomyocytes associated with MI and the resulting morbidity and mortality.
Our Solution: Direct In Vivo Reprogramming of Resident Cardiac Fibroblasts to Create Cardiomyocytes
Cellular reprogramming is the process of converting cells of one type into another cell type. Shinya Yamanaka and John Gurdon won the Nobel Prize for their discovery that cells in the body can be reprogrammed to become stem cells, called iPSCs, capable of developing into any other type of cell in the body using a combination of four transcriptional factors. Since then, researchers have also found other combinations of factors capable of directly converting cells from one type to another without first going through the iPSC state. Dr. Srivastava, one of our co-founders and a member of our board of directors, was the first to demonstrate direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes in both in vitro and in vivo models, creating the potential for a new approach to cardiac regeneration.
Building on this pioneering work, we have developed a novel AAV-based therapy for direct in vivo reprogramming of resident cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes to replace the cardiomyocytes lost due to an MI. Our goal is to convert the cardiac fibroblasts into new cardiomyocytes to help repair the heart after an MI, and ultimately slow down, stabilize or even potentially reverse the progression to heart failure. Our approach leverages substantial in-house advances in our reprogramming factors, capsid engineering, regulatory elements, and drug delivery to translate cardiac reprogramming science towards clinically relevant solutions.
•Reprogramming factors. Through extensive in vitro screening efforts in actual human cardiac fibroblasts, we identified a unique combination of genes encoding Myocardin and ASCL1, that together, can drive robust direct in vivo reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes, and that we have designed to fit into a single AAV. We use the term reprogramming factors to refer to such combination of genes and any other combinations of genes that when delivered together in a single AAV into cardiac fibroblasts, result in the direct reprogramming of the cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. 
 •Capsid engineering. While AAV9 can be used to target cardiomyocytes, it does not sufficiently transduce cardiac fibroblasts. We have discovered a novel capsid, TNC-CF1, which has a higher transduction efficiency for human cardiac fibroblasts as compared to currently known AAV serotypes. Initial data suggest this novel capsid may also be less susceptible to neutralizing antibodies compared to known serotypes. 
•Regulatory elements. We have pursued rigorous, iterative optimization efforts to create proprietary reprogramming products. We have further optimized Myocardin and cassette regulatory elements to both decrease cassette size and improve reprogramming efficiency. After extensive exploration of single 


and double promoter strategies, we have selected the CAG promoter to drive robust expression of our reprogramming factors. We limit expression of our reprogramming factors in mature cardiomyocytes by including a miR-208 binding site that decreases reprogramming factor expression in mature cardiomyocytes after differentiation from fibroblasts.
•Drug delivery. We are developing, in conjunction with leaders in interventional cardiology, a proprietary percutaneous endomyocardial injection catheter (TND-INJ1) to inject and deliver our gene therapies around scars in the heart in a non-surgical, minimally-invasive procedure. Many potential sites for future clinical studies have experience with endomyocardial injection catheters through previous and ongoing cell therapy studies. 
 The schematic below summarizes the components of our intended reprogramming gene therapy product candidate and mechanism of action.




Preclinical Studies
We have conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to optimize our direct reprogramming approach. Our most advanced results have been achieved primarily with two different constructs, TN1-002 and TN1-006. A summary of certain preclinical data supporting the Reprogramming program in general and TN1-002 in particular was presented at the ASGCT conference in 2020.
Results from in vitro conversion of human cardiac fibroblasts. Our reprogramming approach has been optimized in vitro in adult human cardiac fibroblasts. We have conducted extensive iterative experiments to compare the relative efficiency of various constructs to convert cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes, whereby cardiomyocyte-specific markers like cTnT and a-Actinin are measured to determine the proportion of cells that have been converted from cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes. Results from one such an experiment demonstrate that our TN1-006 construct can convert approximately 40% of human cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes.
 Results from pig disease model. We have demonstrated durable improvement in EF in a pig model of heart failure following an induced MI. In a pig model, TN1-002 was injected directly around the scar area formed 28 days after an induced MI. The figure below demonstrates approximately 10% improvement in EF compared to each animal’s own pre-dose baseline and more than 11% improvement compared to control-treated animals that remained sustained until the end of the experiment at nine weeks:




We believe these data compare favorably to published efficacy data for other cell and gene therapy interventions in large animal models. Very few previous therapeutic attempts have achieved meaningful improvement in EF compared to pre-dose baseline in large animal models, with typical improvements, when observed, of less than 5%. From an assessment of the published literature, including a meta-analysis of multiple therapeutics in HFrEF, we believe that each 5% increase in EF is expected to reduce mortality by approximately 15%.
Our preclinical findings to date provide direction to our ongoing candidate selection efforts. Further analyses of effects in individual animals revealed a clear correlation between levels of TN1-002 vector, reprogramming factor expression, and degree of functional improvement. This provides additional support that the improvements in EF seen in this experiment were a direct result of the delivery and expression of the reprogramming factors by our AAV capsid. We continue to seek ways to ensure more consistent delivery and expression of our reprogramming factors to cardiac fibroblasts, including with the use of novel capsids and novel delivery methods.
Safety. To date, no negative safety findings have been associated with either TN1-002 or TN1-006 in in vivo experiments in rat and pig models, including clinical findings, histopathology, assessment of arrhythmia, and other measures.
Planned Clinical Development
We have received feedback from the FDA through an INTERACT (INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs) review to inform the design of our future preclinical studies. After selection of our product candidate, we plan to initiate IND-enabling studies.
Our development plan is anticipated to include patients with advanced heart failure due to prior MI who meet qualifications for a heart transplant or LVAD as well as a broader patient population with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. In the future, we also may explore potential for development in other forms of heart failure caused by a loss of cardiomyocytes, but not involving a myocardial infarction.
Pipeline Expansion Opportunities
We believe the versatility of our three product platforms and our related differentiated capabilities enables us to rapidly expand our portfolio beyond the initial areas of focus. In addition to the named programs in our current pipeline, there are several programs emerging from each of our platforms that are intended to address rare genetic cardiomyopathies as well as more prevalent forms of heart disease. We continue to research, discover and evaluate new programs arising from our three product platforms. We also continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with leading academic and biopharmaceutical organizations with complementary science and capabilities that share our bold vision for the development of next-generation therapies to benefit individuals and families fighting heart disease.
Our Product Platforms
To unlock the full potential of novel therapies across many forms of heart disease, we are advancing science from three product platforms in parallel. Each platform is intended to address different problems that have historically plagued drug development in the field of cardiology: (i) our Gene Therapy platform to deliver a wide variety of therapeutic payloads more precisely to heart tissue, (ii) our Cellular Regeneration platform to replace heart cells lost to disease, and (iii) our Precision Medicine platform to discover targeted therapies in a modality-agnostic fashion. We are advancing programs from these distinct but interrelated product platforms that combine different science, capabilities, and intellectual property. We believe these three product platforms together yield better insights into disease processes, create more opportunities for successful drug development, mitigate scientific risk, and differentiate our efforts relative to competitors.
Gene Therapy Platform
Gene therapy focuses on repairing or replacing defective or mutated genes to produce a therapeutic effect or treat a disease. AAV is a non-enveloped virus that already exists in some humans and does not cause disease. In gene therapy, the viral DNA within an AAV is replaced with new DNA to become a precisely coded vector to deliver the engineered therapeutic to specific tissues or organs within the body.
AAV vectors are the subject of significant research and development as they can be leveraged as a gene delivery vehicle for a wide range of therapeutic payloads to a wide variety of human cells. AAV-mediated gene therapy has been shown to be highly effective in targeting multiple organs, including the eye, the liver and the central nervous system. These viruses have been used to dose more than 3,300 patients in approximately 150 clinical studies around the world, and there are now several therapies that use such viruses that have been approved by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.
Third-party clinical studies have demonstrated that AAV9 can effectively transduce the hearts of infants and adults. This supports the results of several published non-clinical studies using AAV9 in murine and NHP models. Overall, data suggest that AAV9 is a highly effective parental vector for the purpose of cardiac gene therapy where the target cells are cardiomyocytes (one of the most abundant cell types in the heart responsible for contraction). In addition, we are aware of over 2,300 patients worldwide that have been treated using Novartis Pharmaceutical’s Zolgensma (developed by AveXis), a therapy utilizing IV AAV9. Based on the totality of preclinical and clinical evidence, we have also chosen to use AAV9 to support our TN-201 and TN-401 programs.
 However, AAV9 has limitations. AAV9 has a well-established ability to transduce the liver and the central nervous system, in addition to the heart, which may create safety considerations. Also, some individuals have neutralizing antibodies to AAV9, making them ineligible for AAV9-based treatments. Cardiac-specific promoters like cTnT, can help limit the expression of AAV-delivered genes to cardiomyocytes, but do not enable targeted gene expression in other heart cells (e.g. cardiac fibroblasts). Additionally, the level of gene expression from these promoters may not be sufficient for therapeutic effect for some targets.
Therefore, there is significant room for improvement, and we aim to improve gene therapy for the heart in ways that expand its utility. We believe our five core internal capabilities will allow us to identify, engineer, validate, deliver and manufacture novel AAV vectors to optimize the delivery and expression of therapies more selectively to cells of interest in the heart. With our capsid engineering capabilities, we have designed and screened more than one billion AAV variants to find novel capsids with higher tropism and transduction efficiency for different types of heart cells, lower transduction efficiency for the liver and other tissues, and lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. We have discovered promoters and regulatory elements that enable more precise gene expression in specific heart cells. We are developing new catheters and are exploring different ROAs to more precisely deliver vectors to heart tissue. Additionally, we have established know-how to enable more optimal manufacturing, including of novel AAV capsids.
The product candidates arising from our Gene Therapy platform are intended to overcome the shortcomings of traditional pharmacological or surgical interventions that are not able to address the underlying genetic factors contributing to heart disease. We believe our proprietary capabilities open the opportunity to deliver novel gene therapies to patients with heart disease and position us to become a leader in cardiac gene therapy. We are leveraging these capabilities to develop gene therapies for rare, genetic forms of heart disease, as well as to enable the transition to more prevalent forms as well.
Cellular Regeneration Platform
Scientists have long known that the human heart is not able to regenerate itself, unlike many other organs in the body. Acute MI—more commonly referred to as a heart attack—can kill as many as 25% of cardiomyocytes from the LV, or approximately one billion cells. The heart has no natural way to replace cells that are lost slowly with age or suddenly due to disease. Acute MI is associated with a 30% mortality rate; about 50% of the deaths occur prior to arrival at the hospital. An additional 5% to 10% of survivors die within the first year after their MI. Approximately half of all patients with an MI are re-hospitalized within one year of their first MI. The loss of healthy functional cells is a contributing factor to other forms of heart disease as well. One reason that disease is so prevalent and a leading cause of death in the world is due to the lack of regenerative potential of the heart. Finding ways to replace lost heart cells is one of the “holy grails” of regenerative medicine.
There are two abundant cell types in the heart: cardiomyocytes, which are the cells that are responsible for contraction during each heartbeat, and cardiac fibroblasts, that produce and secrete growth factors, cytokines and other signaling molecules contributing to structural, biochemical, mechanical and electrical properties of the myocardium. While cardiac fibroblasts are able to divide and proliferate, cardiomyocytes are post-mitotic, meaning they are incapable of regenerating. cardiomyocytes that are lost due to aging or disease are replaced by fibrotic scar tissue that is permanent and irreparable.



The field of cardiac regeneration has historically been dominated by ex vivo cell therapy approaches using autologous (from self) or allogeneic (from donors) cell sources to replace lost cardiomyocytes. However, there have been no successful therapies after scores of clinical studies involving thousands of patients. Any modest efficacy seen in clinical studies are now often attributed to indirect paracrine effects rather than true cardiac regeneration. Some have tried to induce regeneration by infusion or injecting cells generated from hiPSC-CMs or human embryonic stem cells, but that has been fraught with many challenges, as these cells have an embryonic phenotype and generate arrhythmias once injected into the heart; recipients need to be immunosuppressed to avoid rejection; and integration into the electric and mechanical connections of the heart is still imperfect.
We are advancing a cardiac regeneration approach based on research conducted by our founders at Gladstone Institutes and UTSW, who pioneered the idea of restoring heart function after a heart attack by in vivo regeneration of lost cardiomyocytes. Our approach is intended to achieve this by using viral vectors to deliver a proprietary combination of three genes that when delivered together in a single AAV can permanently convert—or “reprogram”—a patient’s own resident cardiac fibroblasts into new cardiomyocytes.
This approach was inspired by the Nobel-prize winning discoveries of Shinya Yamanaka. He first discovered that human cells can be “reprogrammed” with certain specific factors—which became known as the “Yamanaka factors”—to become iPSCs, and that these newly formed iPSCs were in turn capable of differentiating to become any other human cell type in the body, including heart cells. Our founders and other academic labs built on this idea and demonstrated that it is possible to directly convert cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes without first going through the iPSC stage. Dr. Srivastava, one of our co-founders and a member of our board of directors, was the first to demonstrate proof of concept of this “direct reprogramming” approach for cardiac regeneration in vivo in a mouse model and in vitro with human cells. Several independent academic labs around the world have subsequently

replicated the results with direct reprogramming for cardiac regeneration using the same factors as well as new combinations.

The figure below helps illustrate the idea of direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes using the Waddington model for cellular differentiation:



There have been several historical challenges for the field of direct reprogramming for cardiac regeneration to turn this promising scientific discovery into potentially viable therapies. Most academic efforts required anywhere from three to five factors to achieve the conversion of human cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes, and the overall conversion rate was relatively low. Some of these efforts used a combination of retroviruses and small molecules to achieve this conversion, which is not clinically applicable. The published proof-of-concept work using viral gene therapy to deliver cardiac reprogramming factors has been demonstrated in murine models of acute MI (i.e. immediately at the time of onset of heart attack), but not in models of heart failure following MI (i.e. following some period of time after the heart attack has occurred) which more accurately simulates the situation that would be adopted in the clinical setting.
We believe we are the first to potentially overcome these challenges. We have discovered a proprietary combination of three genes that can be co-packaged and co-expressed from a single proprietary AAV vector engineered for higher transduction of cardiac fibroblasts when compared to existing parental capsids. We have demonstrated higher transdifferentiation rates in vitro using human cardiac fibroblasts that are higher than rates reported in published studies using combinations of other factors intended to drive reprogramming. We have demonstrated robust and durable proof-of-concept of this approach in multiple rodent models of acute MI and heart failure post-MI. Most importantly, based on publicly available information to date, we believe our results in a pig model of heart failure due to prior MI represent the first-ever successful demonstration of the potential therapeutic benefit of this approach in a human-sized heart.
We believe our in vivo approach to cardiac regeneration may have several advantages over ex vivo cell therapies. Because the newly formed cardiomyocytes are generated from the patients’ own cells, they are not rejected by the body and no immunosuppression is needed. Since these newly formed cardiomyocytes are generated from within the patient’s heart tissue, it may be easier for them to electrically and mechanically connect with surrounding cells as they mature and to contribute to healthy heart function with lower risk for arrhythmias. In addition, it is easier to manufacture and to deliver AAV-based therapies and to offer them at commercially viable prices compared to cell-based therapies.
The initial focus of our Cellular Regeneration platform is on the development of disease-modifying treatments for heart failure due to prior MI. We believe the versatility of this product platform and related differentiated capabilities position us to expand our portfolio of therapies rapidly and pursue other indications involving loss of cardiomyocytes.

Precision Medicine Platform
The idea of “precision medicine” has been around for a number of years, with the core concept of delivering the right therapy to the right patient at the right time. Recently, the idea of precision medicine has gained traction in oncology, in particular, with the benefit of a better understanding of the genetics of different tumor types, and a growing ability to match therapies to specific mutations (e.g., Genentech’s Herceptin therapy for HER2+ breast cancer). We aim to bring this concept of precision medicine to the discovery and development of targeted therapies for heart disease.
There is an increasing understanding of the genetic basis for many cardiomyopathies, including DCM, HCM, restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). DCM provides an interesting case study. Mutations in more than 50 genes have been identified for DCM, with more than 50% of patients presenting with multiple mutations. These mutations affect different parts of the cellular apparatus of patients’ cardiomyocytes, including the sarcomere, nucleus, ion channels, and cellular membranes. Yet mutations in proteins with diverse biology present as a common disease phenotype, suggesting common nodes of disease yet to be discovered. Despite this heterogeneity of genetic background and underlying pathophysiology, the therapies used for these patients are the same as therapies used for patients with other forms of heart failure. We envision a future in which therapies are more specific to the underlying cause of disease and are used to treat patients who have been categorized based on their underlying genetic mutations.
The figure below helps illustrate our vision for “precision medicine” research and development for heart disease through the lens of DCM:




It is also necessary to have the appropriate disease models to discover new targets and to test new therapies. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of representative in vivo models; of the greater than 50 genes known to cause DCM when mutated, less than ten have relevant murine models to support drug discovery. The situation is even worse for others forms of genetic cardiomyopathy. We are committed to finding new ways to model genetic cardiomyopathies, including in vivo but also in vitro models.
There is a growing body of academic literature supporting the use of human iPSC-CMs to model human heart disease and the potential cardiotoxicity of therapeutics during drug discovery. This can be helpful where animal models for specific forms of heart disease either do not yet exist or are not yet sufficiently representative of human disease. There are also a growing number of biopharmaceutical companies that are using iPSCs for phenotypic screening and drug discovery. We are advancing a novel approach of using proprietary human iPSC-CMs disease models for target identification and drug discovery specifically for heart disease.



The figure below illustrates how we have internalized and integrated six key aspects necessary to advance the discovery of precision medicine therapeutics using human iPSC-CMs:



We have demonstrated proof of concept of this approach using a human iPSC-CM disease model representing a specific genetic DCM mutation plus machine learning algorithms to measure variations in appearance of these cells when screened with a library of several thousand small molecule compounds. We identified several biologically relevant hits and validated HDAC6 as a specific target of interest. We have since turned our findings into a product candidate in our HDAC6i program, TN-301, with in vivo activity and tolerability demonstrated in multiple heart disease models of HFpEF and DCM and evidence of target engagement during clinical evaluation.
We are currently conducting target identification screens for both gene therapy and small molecule targets in multiple human iPSC-CM disease models of DCM. We are also expanding our efforts to different genetic backgrounds including the leading genetic causes of cardiomyopathy. We believe the versatility of our Precision Medicine platform and related capabilities enables us to rapidly expand our portfolio of product candidates beyond TN-301.
Our Core Capabilities
We utilize five core internal capabilities to support our three product platforms. Our key capabilities include the creation and development of (1) disease models to more accurately simulate human heart disease phenotypes, (2) proprietary heart-tropic AAV capsids designed to enable precise tissue targeting and increase safety, (3) proprietary promoters and regulatory elements to control gene expression, (4) fit-for-purpose drug delivery methods for more optimal uptake and distribution of our product candidates and (5) scalable AAV manufacturing to better control quality, costs, timelines and supply.
We believe integration of these in-house capabilities provides us with several advantages and differentiates our efforts relative to other drug discovery companies, especially for gene therapy drug development. Through the combination of these capabilities, we are developing product candidates that can address the complicated characteristics of heart disease. For example, we believe with our capabilities in capsids and promoter design and delivery, we can overcome the limitations faced by prior cardiac gene therapy approaches by enabling more precise delivery and more robust gene expression and lowering the risk of off-target effects. We also believe that these approaches can overcome the historical challenges of drug development for heart disease, by enabling delivery of a wide range of therapeutic approaches to specific cells in the heart.
By having our capabilities in-house, we believe we are able to achieve deeper insight, shorten product development cycles, and improve the probability of technical and regulatory success for our product candidates compared to what can be achieved with a more outsourced approach. This further allows us to rapidly build a diverse pipeline of product candidates. Ultimately, we believe our differentiated capabilities can support

development of product candidates that, if approved, could address the high unmet need of patients with heart diseases.
1. Disease Models
We have internalized the ability to create and integrate in vitro and in vivo models within our research organization, which allows us to simulate human heart disease phenotypes. We believe our success will be supported by the know-how we are developing and the proprietary integration of these disease models across our programs.
•In vitro cell-based disease models: For our in vitro disease models, we have leveraged the seminal discovery of methods used to generate iPSCs to establish disease models based on human iPSC-CMs. We have implemented three primary approaches to model human heart disease in this way: (i) short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) constructs to silence specific genes of interest in iPSC-CMs; (ii) CRISPR-based gene editing approaches to create isogenic iPSC-cell lines where specific genes have been altered; and (iii) iPSCs derived from patients with severe heart disease, for example, severe DCM resulting in early heart failure and transplant, sourced from commercial and academic collaborators. 
 In the figure below, we illustrate our primary disease model approaches based on iPSC-CMs:



These disease models can collectively help simulate the impact of human disease-causing mutations on the appearance and function of cardiomyocytes and model the impact of potentially disease-modifying treatments on such cells. In the figure below, we illustrate how, through use of gene editing and gene silencing tools, we can modify the appearance of normal iPSC-CMs to appear disorganized, and subsequently restore cell appearance with compounds from our screening library:



We initially used cells from these disease models plated in two-dimensional formats. We have since advanced our efforts to include three-dimensional engineered heart tissue disease models where the cells have a more mature phenotype and with contractility that can be measured more reliably.
•iPSC production: To conduct robust target identification and drug discovery screens using our cell-based disease models, we need to produce large volumes of these human iPSC-CMs. We have developed the necessary know-how to do so reliably and reproducibly at increasing scale. 
 •Imaging techniques: We use a combination of immunostaining, high-resolution imaging, and imaging algorithms to visualize and quantify phenotypic differences between our in-house iPSC-CM disease models. We can measure several details of the sarcomeres of these cell lines, including sarcomere density, disarray and Z-disc area. 
 
•Machine learning algorithms: We have used machine learning algorithms to support high-throughput phenotypic screening of our iPSC-CM disease models. The algorithms can rapidly and reproducibly measure subtle differences in the overall appearance between wild-type iPSC-CM cells and the different disease models, as well as differences on the disease models in response to compounds in our screening libraries. 
 The figure below illustrates the output of a screen in a disease model of DCM, using siRNA silencing of the BAG3 gene, with a curated library of greater than 5,000 small molecule compounds. A deep learning algorithm that was trained on images of the disease model and on normal cells was used to determine which compounds caused the sarcomeres within the cells to appear more disorganized, representing more sarcomere damage (red), or more organized, representing less sarcomere damage (green), as measured by a “cardiomyocyte score”:




•In vivo models: For our in vivo disease models, we have a dedicated onsite in vivo pharmacology group and vivarium. We have established approximately 17 rodent heart disease models, both genetic and non-genetic, and continue to develop new models in-house as needed. We can dose both gene therapies as well as small molecules. We can perform heart surgeries on these rodent models and use blinded echocardiography-based imaging techniques to assess the impact of our therapies under development. The internalization of these capabilities greatly reduces our reliance on external CROs and academic organizations and significantly increases the speed and consistency with which we can iterate on product prototypes, generate data and formulate insights on our product candidates. We also work with established CROs for research efforts involving large animal models (e.g., NHPs and pigs), including for efficacy studies and evaluation of drug delivery methods. Through these efforts we have developed important insights into the advantages and limitations of specific models and have learned how to optimize the design of our experiments. This insight influences our preclinical drug development strategies and our discussions with regulatory agencies. 
 2. Capsid Engineering
Our goal is to discover, design, and develop novel heart-tropic AAV capsids with superior attributes in order to enable more precise cardiomyocytes targeting and to improve the safety profile of our product candidates by reducing tropism for other organs, particularly the liver. A capsid is the protective protein shell which contains the

AAV vector and AAV tropism is determined by interaction of capsid proteins and host cell surface receptors. To achieve our goals related to capsid engineering, we have established in-house AAV capsid engineering capabilities and have designed and screened over one billion variants from diverse, proprietary libraries to discover, design, and develop novel capsids to support our programs.

•Cell specificity: We are using our capsid engineering capabilities to identify novel AAV capsids with an overall higher tropism for the heart compared to other organs and selectively to target the two most abundant cell types in the heart: cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. We already have achieved in vivo proof of concept for novel vectors for both cell types. Having capsids that more specifically target one cell type over another could help improve efficacy and safety and lower cost of goods for our future product candidates. 
 •Library diversity: We have screened more than one billion variants from 30 diverse libraries utilizing a range of strategies, including rational modification of surface residues as well as directed evolution efforts with peptide insertion libraries, chimeric libraries, and libraries based on systematic alteration of variable regions using different parental capsids. The diversity of approaches increases the likelihood that we will find capsids with novel properties. 
 The image below illustrates our efforts to achieve diverse heart-tropic AAV capsids.



•Screening models: We have performed our screens in a variety of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico libraries. Current efforts are focused on direct screening in NHPs, as well as use of machine learning algorithms. We believe our probability of finding novel variants that will translate to superior attributes in humans is highest in NHPs. We believe our in silico approaches can complement these efforts to help predict novel variants. 
 •Screening criteria: We have broad criteria for the selection of novel capsids, including improved tropism for the heart compared to other organs, with a particular interest in de-targeting the liver; improved transduction of specific heart cell types; lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies; and comparable manufacturing in both HEK293- and Sf9/rBV-based manufacturing systems. We seek capsids that can outperform the relevant parental capsids, which may vary depending on the intended use and on some or all of these criteria. 
 Through these efforts, we have discovered proprietary capsids with superior performance over parental variants in multiple species, including NHPs. These capsids have improved tropism for the heart compared to other organs and even for specific cells within the heart; improved transduction and expression within the heart cells; and lower susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. We have also developed insights about the performance of novel capsids across different species including mice and NHPs. Several capsids identified have equivalent transduction in the heart and lower transduction of the liver compared to AAV9, leading to an overall better heart-to-liver transduction ratio as validated in an NHP model. Additionally, we have shown that several capsids we identified have overall better ability to evade human neutralizing antibodies compared to AAV9. We have also generated additional data that demonstrate that certain of these capsids have a greater ability to improve heart function compared to AAV9 in specific disease models.

Overall, these data provide important proof of concept of the potential utility of capsid engineering. Therefore, we have taken steps to protect the intellectual property that support the novel capsids identified from our initial capsid engineering screens, and intend to continue this practice as we generate additional data from our ongoing capsid engineering efforts.
 3. Promoters and Regulatory Elements
Promoters and regulatory elements are DNA sequences whose function is to determine the level of gene expression at the RNA level and in which cells transcription will occur. These elements can therefore be essential to the success of gene therapy. Enabled by our in-house molecular biology capabilities, we have created novel heart-specific promoters, as well as regulatory elements which control gene expression within the cells to support our AAV-based programs. We are designing promoters and regulatory elements to help ensure a more precise and conditional expression of therapeutic payloads in different cell types in the heart. We believe our innovations in these elements may further support the successful clinical development of our product candidates.
Illustrative examples of our innovations in this area include:
•Heart specificity: We have developed cardiac-specific promoters that enable more selective and robust expression in the heart as compared to other organs. During optimization of TN-201, we developed a cardiomyocyte-specific promoter, TNP-CM1, with improved performance attributes as compared to the standard cTnT promoter. In vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed that TNP-CM1 significantly increased expression of the MYBPC3 gene compared to what can be achieved with the standard cTnT promoter. In addition, in a mouse model we observed 1000-fold selectivity of expression in cardiac tissue relative to other tissues, including skeletal muscle, brain and liver. 
 


•Cell specificity: We have also developed a proprietary combination of regulatory elements that enable more optimal and selective expression in one cell type in the heart compared to others. For our Reprogramming program for cellular regeneration, we discovered ways to optimize the robust co-expression of two protein-coding genes and one micro-RNA gene delivered within a single AAV in cardiac fibroblasts, which we believe supports higher efficacy in preclinical models. We also discovered how to use specific micro-RNA binding sites to silence the translation of those same genes in both existing cardiomyocytes as well as newly created cardiomyocytes, which may provide a safety benefit and reduce the chance for off-target effects. 
 In the figure below, we illustrate how the use of a novel regulatory element, TNR-CF1, helped prevent the expression of a fluorescent protein in the cardiomyocytes of a mouse model and only allowed expression in the cardiac fibroblasts. We have used this regulatory element in our Reprogramming program to focus the expression of our proprietary factors in resident cardiac fibroblasts for the creation of new cardiomyocytes, but to prevent the expression of those factors both in resident cardiomyocytes and in newly created cardiomyocytes, which we believe will improve the safety profile of our future product candidates:






•Tunable gene expression: We have also demonstrated the ability to develop an entire spectrum of novel promoters to titer the expression of genes within cardiomyocytes, by combining various combinations of enhancer elements from different cardiomyocyte selective genes. Through data (not shown in the figure below) generated in our DWORF program, more than ten promoters were designed and tested in vitro in human iPSC-CMs, and in vivo in murine models to optimize the expression of the DWORF gene to be higher than what can be achieved with a standard cTnT promoter. 
 In the figure below, we show data for six of our promoters and cassette engineering efforts that illustrate how we have been able to create a suite of cardiac-specific constructs that are able to mediate significantly higher expression of the DWORF gene than can be achieved with a standard cTnT promoter:



4. Drug Delivery
Delivery of drugs to the heart is widely considered to be an important challenge to successful translation of cardiac gene therapy and regenerative medicines into approved products. The diversity of programs in our current pipeline necessitates the use of different delivery methods. We are actively exploring different ROAs as well as different infusion- or injection-based catheters to support more targeted delivery and more efficient uptake of therapies based on viral vectors. We believe our discoveries in drug delivery can widen the therapeutic index of our product candidates by reducing the dose required for a therapeutic benefit.
Several distinct methods of drug delivery for the heart have been explored by different groups for gene- or cell-based therapies, including infusion-based approaches, such as peripheral IV infusion, intracoronary infusion, and retrograde coronary sinus infusion, and injection-based, such as transendocardial injection and epicardial injection. These delivery methods vary significantly in terms of degree of invasiveness, distribution of therapy around the heart, degree of therapy uptake into the heart, technical difficulty of administration, and clinical

relevance and experience. For some approaches, additional methods to improve therapeutic delivery have also been tested to improve perfusion of AAV into the heart. Through these efforts, several groups have demonstrated how different delivery methods can meaningfully affect the relative uptake and biodistribution of therapies in the heart compared to peripheral organs.

Illustrative examples of various delivery methods for the heart are shown below:(1)

 For the initial product candidates emerging from our Gene Therapy platform, including TN-201, we generally need broad distribution across the heart tissue that is more suited to infusion-based approaches. By contrast, for the initial product candidates emerging from our Cellular Regeneration platform, including those from our Reprogramming program, we need more precise delivery into the heart tissue directly around a scar area of the LV in a way that is more suited to injection-based approaches.
Illustrative examples of our innovations and capabilities in drug delivery include:
•Catheters: To support our Reprogramming program for cardiac regeneration, we are developing a novel transendocardial injection catheter for more precise delivery of therapeutic payloads around the scar area that is formed after heart attack, but in a way that is minimally invasive and would not require heart surgery. The prototype of our catheter was designed with the help of interventional cardiologists and is based on similar catheters that have been successfully used in clinical trials. The catheter is designed to be steered into the heart via the femoral artery in the groin area. It has a deflectable tip that can be curved to better access the different parts of the heart. This initial prototype was tested in a large animal model and was able to direct injections to all areas of the LV. We are adding mapping capabilities to the design to allow for more precise delivery during the treatment procedure. 
 •ROAs: We prioritize head-to-head comparison of different ROAs in large animal models to confirm the optimal method for delivery for each product candidate. For example, for TN-201, we conducted experiments in NHPs to compare the degree of drug uptake and biodistribution for peripheral IV infusion and infusions delivered directly in the heart. Based on the results, we chose systemic IV infusions as the ROA for TN-201. In addition, for our Reprogramming program, we conducted experiments in pig models to demonstrate that a less invasive catheter-based transendocardial injection to the LV inside wall can achieve a similar degree of drug uptake and biodistribution as a more invasive direct epicardial injection to the LV outside wall requiring open-heart surgery. 
 5. Manufacturing
We have fully integrated and internalized AAV manufacturing capabilities to support our Gene Therapy and Cellular Regeneration platforms. Our overall strategy is to have complete ownership of our PD, analytical development, MFG and QC so that we have deep insight into the attributes of our drug substance and drug product. Internalized manufacturing enables continuous process improvement, consistency (quality and productivity) and innovation that can support manufacturing requirements for clinical development and commercialization not only for rare populations, but also for more prevalent indications, and allows us to be a partner of choice in strategic drug development partnerships and with early-stage academic programs.

Overall, the internalization of these efforts provides us with know-how that yields several advantages that allow us to be in a better position to support our future capacity expansion needs or swiftly transfer technology know-how to CDMOs to achieve dual sourcing for product candidates for risk mitigation purposes.
•Vector core: We have established vector production to support early research involving both parental and novel AAV capsids at the 50L scale. We have hired key process development, analytical development and QC personnel to internalize those capabilities. We have also established the necessary process development expertise to support comparable product efficacy in both HEK293-based and Sf9/rBV-based manufacturing systems for both existing AAV serotypes as well as for novel capsids discovered from our capsid engineering efforts. 
 •Manufacturing Technology Development Center (MTDC): We have established in-house operations at the 200L scale to support all non-clinical studies including those involving large animal models, such as pigs and NHPs, under GLP regulations. We also rely on the MTDC for assay development and technology transfer to our dedicated cGMP facility. Our initial production at this scale has been at yields and with full/empty capsid ratios that compare favorably to industry standards. 
 •Genetic Medicines Manufacturing Center: Our GMMC is a dedicated cGMP facility for AAV drug product manufacturing and is located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The facility operates at the 1000L scale to support all clinical development activities from FIH clinical trials through to late stage development, as well as initial commercialization, if regulatory approval is obtained. It uses a modular design that will support scale-out and/or scale-up of manufacturing capacity in response to evolving needs. 
 •Intellectual property: We have in-licensed and internally developed certain manufacturing-related intellectual property to support our programs. We have filed multiple patent applications covering improvements that will support scale-up of AAV manufacturing for supply of our gene therapy product candidates intended for more prevalent heart disease populations. 
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe our three product platforms, scientific know-how, five core internal capabilities, and experience provides us with competitive advantages. However, we face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidate we develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies as well as therapies currently in development and that may be developed in the future.
Due to the depth and diversity of our pipeline, we may face competition from a variety of companies, including:

TN-201: We believe the principal competition for TN-201 will be programs that address the underlying genetic cause of MYBPC3-associated HCM. Based on publicly available data, we don’t believe any such treatments have received approval from a regulatory agency or reached clinical development. Based on publicly available data, BioMarin and DiNAQOR’s BMV-293 is only program in preclinical development for treating the underlying cause of MYBPC3-associated HCM. We may also face competition from treatments for both nHCM and oHCM, including Bristol Myers Squibb’s myosin inhibitor Camzyos approved for oHCM. There are also several other programs in clinical development for HCM.
 
TN-301: We believe that the principal competition for TN-301 in HFpEF includes agents approved in the U.S. and/or Europe for the treatment of HFpEF, including Novartis’ Entresto and Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingleheim’s SGLT2 inhibitor, Jardiance. While there are no approved HDAC6 inhibitors for cardiovascular indications, HFpEF clinical development is an area of robust investment and multiple additional agents for the treatment of HFpEF are in clinical development.
 
TN-401: We believe the principal competition for TN-401 will be programs that address the underlying genetic cause of PKP2-associated ARVC. Based on publicly available data, we don’t believe any such treatments

have received approval from a regulatory agency or reached clinical development. However, there are several programs in preclinical development for treating the underlying cause of PKP2-associated ARVC, including Rocket Pharmaceutical’s RP-A601, Lexeo Therapeutics’ LX2020 and Stridebio’s STRX-330. We may also face competition from therapies and medical devices directed to treat the symptoms of ARVC.
 We cannot predict whether other therapies may be developed that demonstrate greater efficacy, and we may have direct and substantial competition from such therapies in the future. We expect to face increasing competition as new, more effective treatments enter the market and further advancements in technologies are made. We expect market adoption of any treatments that we develop and commercialize to be dependent on, among other things, efficacy, safety, delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our product candidates.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technology, manufacturing processes and know-how, to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property or other proprietary rights. To protect our intellectual property rights, we primarily rely on patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and agreements, including employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing patent applications in the U.S. and in certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, medical devices and systems for their administration, our proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business.

Trade Secrets
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, product platforms and product candidates. Through development of internal manufacturing capabilities for AAV-based gene vectors, we have secured proprietary know-how and trade secrets related to our most-advanced programs as well as vector technologies widely applicable to potential AAV therapies. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and other third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
For information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Manufacturing
We rely on a combination of our internal manufacturing capabilities as well as on external CDMOs for the manufacture of the drug substance and/or drug product of our portfolio programs, and intend to continue to utilize this strategy as our programs progress through various stages of clinical development and eventually to commercialization, if approved.
 AAV Manufacturing
 We have fully integrated and internalized AAV manufacturing capabilities to support product candidates from our Gene Therapy and Cellular Regeneration platforms. Our MTDC is co-located with our research labs in the San Francisco Bay Area. The MTDC includes a Vector Core, upstream and downstream process development labs, as well as assay development and QC capabilities. The MTDC does non-GMP work and operates at the shake flask, 50L, and 200L scales to support all non-clinical studies including, IND-enabling efficacy, pharmacology, toxicology, and biodistribution studies involving both small and large animal models. We also rely on the MTDC for

technology transfer of our proprietary processes to our GMMC, a dedicated cGMP facility for AAV drug substance and drug product manufacturing also located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The GMMC facility operates at the 200L and 1000L scales to support all clinical development activities from FIH clinical trials through to late-stage development, as well as initial commercialization, if regulatory approval is obtained. We utilized the GMMC to produce drug product for our FIH clinical study for our TN-201 program in 2022 and expect to produce clinical supply for our TN-401 program at the facility as well. We customized approximately half of the 94,000 square foot GMMC facility using a modular design that will support our ability to scale-out and/or scale-up of manufacturing capacity in response to evolving needs, including future potential clinical and commercial production needs.
In addition to our internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities, we have also negotiated and entered into master service agreements with multiple CDMOs for additional AAV manufacturing and filling capacity and related risk mitigation.  Additionally, we will rely on third parties for certain manufacturing of ancillary materials and release assays, for which we have already secured or intend to secure dual-sourced capacity for risk mitigation.
 Small Molecule Manufacturing
 To optimize our use of resources and to utilize extensive experience in small molecule manufacturing, we work with CDMOs for our small molecule programs. We initiated and completed cGMP manufacturing to support our FIH study for our HDAC6 inhibitor small molecule program, TN-301, in 2021.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, QC, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biologic and small molecule therapeutic products. Generally, before a new therapeutic product can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating a biologic candidate’s quality, safety, purity and potency, or a small molecule candidate’s quality, safety and efficacy, must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. For biologic candidates, potency is similar to efficacy and is interpreted to mean the specific ability or capacity of the product, as indicated by appropriate laboratory tests or by adequately controlled clinical data obtained through the administration of the product in the manner intended, to effect a given result.
U.S. Biologic and Small Molecule Drug Product Development
In the U.S., the FDA regulates small molecule and biologic therapeutic products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Biopharmaceuticals, including both small molecule and biologic products, also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biologics must be licensed by the FDA through a biologics license application (BLA), and small molecule products must be approved by the FDA through a new drug application (NDA), before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements; 
 •Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 


•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and potency or efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •Submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA; 
 •A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to accept the filing for review; 
 •Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where biologic or small molecule product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, purity, potency, and QCs, or the small molecule product’s identity, chemistry, and QCs; 
 •Potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; 
 •Satisfactory completion of other studies required by the FDA, including immunogenicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and stability studies; 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic or small molecular therapeutic in the United States; and 
 •Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
 The data required to support a BLA or NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product biochemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for toxicity and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use for supporting subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical

trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA or NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA or NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the investigational product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or non-compliance with GCP requirements. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigational product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the biochemical and physical characteristics of the investigational product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be

selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent and length of which are uncertain, we continue to monitor changes in FDA policies and work with our clinical sites and investigators to mitigate potential risks to our ongoing clinical trials. The FDA, along with other global health authorities, has issued various guidance on COVID-19 related matters, including, among others, conducting clinical trials during the pandemic; manufacturing, supply chain, and drug and biological product inspections during the COVID-19 public health emergency; and GMP considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. If new guidance and policies are promulgated by the FDA that require changes in our clinical protocol or clinical development plans, our anticipated timelines and regulatory approval may be delayed or materially impacted. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations is unclear.
 NDA and BLA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA for a biologic product or an NDA for a small molecule drug product, along with proposed labeling, biochemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality, identity, purity and other relevant data. In short, the BLA or NDA is a request for approval to market the biologic or drug product for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity and potency for a biologic, or safety and efficacy for a small molecule drug product. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before the product may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s FY 2023 fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2023, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA or NDA, is approximately $3.2 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human prescription drug product ($393,933 in 2023) and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics or small molecular drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDA for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs and NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA or NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA or NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA or NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA or NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA or NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs or NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes physicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations

when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/ or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
For biologic or small molecule drug products, an orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the indication for which it is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast-track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast-track status any time before receiving a BLA or NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA or pre-NDA meeting.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast-track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug product receiving accelerated approval to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a biologic or small molecule drug product shown to be potent or effective for the proposed indication can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. In some cases, FDA may limit the scope of the indication. Such restrictions could have a materially adverse effect on our business and our ability to obtain profitability.
Additionally, a drug product may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drug products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast-track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Depending on other factors that impact clinical trial timelines and development, such as our ability to identify and onboard clinical sites and rates of study participant enrollment and drop-out, we may not realize all the benefits of these expedited or accelerated review programs. Further, in December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilars or Interchangeable Biosimilars
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA), signed into law in 2010, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:
•Analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; 
 •Animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and 
 •A clinical trial or trials (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used. 


In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:
•The proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product; 
 •The condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product; 
 •The route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and 
 •The facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent.
 Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
•The proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product; 
 •The proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and 
 •For a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. 
 FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product.
The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product.

Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an orphan drug) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued.
Abbreviated NDA Pathway for Generic Drug Products
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as “the Hatch-Waxman Act,” established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be bioequivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process, which are commonly referred to as the “innovator” or “reference” drugs. Approval to market and to distribute these bioequivalent drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated NDA (ANDA) with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the API, drug product formulation, specifications, stability, analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data, QC procedures and bioequivalence. Rather than demonstrating safety and effectiveness, an ANDA applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to an approved reference drug. In certain situations, an applicant may submit an ANDA for a product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a reference drug based upon FDA approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve an ANDA Suitability Petition if it finds that the product does not raise questions of safety and efficacy requiring new clinical data. ANDAs generally cannot be submitted for products that are not bioequivalent to the referenced drug or that are labeled for a use that is not approved for the reference drug. Applicants seeking to market such products can submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA with supportive data from clinical trials.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new application or supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
 •Warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •Refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 
 •Applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
FDA Regulation of Combination Biologic-Medical Device Products
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as biologic components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities and frequently by different Centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a Center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead Center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead Center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead Center with other components of the FDA. The determination of which Center will be the lead Center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a biologic-device combination product candidate is attributable to the biologic product candidate, the FDA Center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That Office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA Center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
A combination product with a biologic product candidate as the primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the biologic approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the BLA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product meet applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both biologics and devices, including the Quality System, regulations applicable to medical devices.
We may develop one or more of our biologic product candidates in combination with a novel delivery medical device, such as an injection catheter device for more precise delivery of a biologic product candidate. Regulatory review of such combination product candidate will increase the timing, cost, and the complexity of the FDA review and approval process, and subject us to additional regulations and exposure to liability. Pending discussion with the FDA, if the medical device is considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations, then we may be required to comply with the IDE regulations for clinical studies in addition to the IND regulations and may be required to submit both an IDE and an IND before commencing clinical

testing of the combination product. We cannot provide any assurance regarding how FDA will regulate our combination product, or if we will be successful in obtaining approval for any combination product.
510(k) clearance process
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a Premarket Approval Application (PMA). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process may take three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or require a PMA. In addition, the FDA may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, which may significantly affect the process.
De novo classification process
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a different route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data.
PMA approval process
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for medical devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which imposes extensive testing, control, documentation, and other Quality Assurance (QA) and GMP requirements.
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.

For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action, including fines, penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, and exclusion from participating in government programs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business and increase our exposure to additional liabilities. For more information, see “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters.”
 U.S. Data Privacy and Security Laws
In the United States, a broad variety of laws, rules, regulations and standards relating to privacy, data protection and information security may apply to our activities, such as state data breach notification laws, state personal data privacy laws (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act effective January 1, 2023 (CCPA)), state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. The CCPA requires covered businesses that process personal information of California residents to disclose their data collection, use, sharing and retention practices, provides California residents with data privacy rights (including the ability to opt out of certain disclosures of personal information including for certain advertising purposes), imposes operational requirements for covered businesses, provides for significant civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches and statutory damages (that is expected to increase data breach class action litigation and result in significant exposure to costly legal judgements and settlements). Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. Although there are limited exemptions for clinical trial data under the CCPA, the CCPA and other similar laws could impact our business activities, depending on their interpretation. Other state legislatures have enacted or are currently considering, and may pass, their own comprehensive data privacy and security laws, with potentially greater penalties and more rigorous compliance requirements, and laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personal data has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigation and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business. For more information, see “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters.” We are subject to stringent laws, rules, regulations, policies, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and security and may be subject to additional laws and regulations in jurisdictions into which we expand. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or other harm to our business.


U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA or NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement with respect to one or more patents listed for the drug in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.
European Union Drug Development
Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 (the Regulation), which went into application on January 31, 2022, replaces the Clinical Trials Directive No. 2001/20/EC and aims to harmonize the processes for assessment and supervision of clinical trials throughout the European Union. Under the Regulation, clinical trial

sponsors can use the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) from January 31, 2022, but are not required to use it immediately, in line with a three-year transition period. CTIS publishes certain clinical trial information on a searchable public website and supports the flow of information and interactions between clinical trial sponsors and regulatory authorities in European Union Member States, European Economic Area countries, and the European Commission.
EU Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of Marketing Authorizations:
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for products that are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Foreign Data Privacy and Security Laws
Outside of the United States, legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in the EU, the GDPR requires data controllers to implement stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including transparent and expanded disclosure to data subjects about how their personal data is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements, and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines up to €20,000,000 or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. We are also subject to the UK GDPR, which implements the GDPR in the UK post-Brexit. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we may process, and we may be required to implement additional measures in an effort to comply with the GDPR and with other laws, rules and regulations in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland relating to privacy and data protection. If our efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable foreign laws, rules and regulations are not successful, or are perceived to be unsuccessful, it could adversely affect our business. For

more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters.” We are subject to stringent laws, rules, regulations, policies, industry standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and security and may be subject to additional laws and regulations in jurisdictions into which we expand. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or other harm to our business.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. Further, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries as well as proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, impose limitations on drug price increases and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products, could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any

negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs, or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect it will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of such legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures, including the prescription drug provisions under the IRA, as well as other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, in order to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product in the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally, prices tend to be significantly lower.
We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in U.S. or foreign legislation directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare and prescription drug prices. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters.”
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 141 full-time employees, representing an over 33% increase in our employee workforce as compared to December 31, 2021. Of these employees, 101 are engaged in research, development and technical operations. 28 of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. (or foreign equivalent) degrees and 10 hold other professional degrees such as a J.D. or M.B.A. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We focus on employee engagement and consider our relationship with our employees to be good, in part as measured by relatively high scores from employee surveys.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and

cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. In addition, we provide a variety of programs and services to help employees meet and balance their needs at work, at home and in life, including a healthcare, insurance and other benefit plans. We regularly assess our benefit programs, employee engagement and turnover, recruitment initiatives, workforce diversity and other matters relevant to human capital management, and review those results with our board of directors on a periodic basis.
 We are an equal opportunity employer and maintain policies that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin/ancestry, age, disability, marital and veteran status. We employ a diverse workforce that, as December 31, 2022, was approximately 65% non-white and 57% women based on our employees’ voluntary self-identification. We strive to create a collaborative culture that fosters internal engagement around our company and our mission to discover, develop and deliver curative therapies that address the underlying drivers of heart disease.
 We are committed to advancing diversity and inclusion (D&I) in our workforce and established a D&I Committee in 2020. We acknowledge that diversity in thought, experience, background, and culture makes our science and our community stronger. Our mission is to foster and create a unique culture where belonging and empowerment are at the forefront of our community. We advocate for diverse perspectives and encourage employees to be authentic, inclusive, and respectful to each other. We discourage behaviors that do not have a positive impact on our community or support our mission to discover, develop, and deliver curative therapies that target the underlying causes of heart disease.
