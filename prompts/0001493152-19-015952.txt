Business Overview
 
MU Global is a beauty and wellness company, providing SPA and wellness service and also Spa related products to the customers. The services provided are designed to improve the overall health system and body function.
 
Since our establishment, the Company has been focusing to expand in the Chinese market, with other country also under consideration as target destinations. As an emerging industry in China, the beauty and wellness industry is still in the early stage there is a huge potential for the industry to growth significantly. According to the report published by the Chinese State Department, the beauty and wellness industry of the country is expected reach the market value of China 8 trillion Chinese Yuan by 2020, accounting for 6.5% of the country Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
 
China has large territory, population, diverse ethnicity and cultural background. As such, it has resulted in different consumer orientations in different cities and townships across the country, therefore, it is particularly challenging to tackle the consumer market with a single business model.
 
The advance in technological development and rise in use of technology in marketing has also intensified the competition, probing the Company to develop the business models that allow quick penetration and huge coverage of different markets, and also being able to cope with the swift changes in the consumer market. Thus, the Company is focusing on three key areas as part of the Company’s early development in the Chinese market.
 
The first and most key focus is to enter the regional market through the adoption of franchisee and agent model, which the other parties are familiar and have deep understanding in the local market, hence its operating strategy is effective and best suited the targeted region.

Second, the key strategy is to ensure rapid development of the Omni channel marketing plan which targets to lease out at least ten thousand Stone Spa Bed (Hot Stone Bath equipment), reducing the time cost for the development of project, and most importantly, working on to spur sales and revenue growth.
 
Lastly, the essential requirement for business success in the Chinese market is to ensure and maintain a clear and transparent business model, which would result in effective collaboration between the company and its agent/franchisee, and consequently leads to efficient market operation and a win-win situation between the two parties
 
Currently, the Company operates in the Chinese market with three business models:

1. | Bedrock Bathing/ Hot Stone Bath 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Bedrock Bathing is a method of keeping the body in shape that involves bathers lying down on a heated slab of rocks embedded on a spa treatment bed without using hot water wearing indoor clothing. The original name for this hot stone bathing is ‘Ganban’yoku’, and it is originated from Japan as the term for a popular form of hot stone or bedrock spa. It is also referred to as “stone-bathing”, but there is no actual bathing or water involved.
 
It is our belief that the effects of bedrock bathing are numerous and both aesthetic and metabolic. Furthermore, the rocks selected for this treatment are believed to provide many health benefits when they are heated. The five stones we intend to use are: Black Silica Stone, Radium Stone, Far Infrared Stone, Negative Ion Stone and Beitou Stone. The average time taken for each therapy is approximately 30 minutes.
 
The Company believes that bedrock bathing treatments will assist in the elimination of suboptimal health conditions caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake, and unhealthy lifestyles. The detoxification process will improve general bodily function and immune system, promote blood circulation, and yield visible skin improvement. The treatment is also believed to improve basal metabolism, resulting in more efficient energy utilization within the body, hence sustainable weight loss to a desirable level. Prolonged proper treatments have also been linked to miscellaneous anti-aging benefits.
 
Our pricing strategy offers great flexibility to our customers to opt for the service they desire which is also within their budget. In order to ensure flexibility, the Company has divided the service into three different tiers, each with different pricing strategy: Flagship, Luxury and Refined. Under the three tiers model, Flagship branch and will be the top tier and will target high-end segment with premium pricing packages. Luxury branch is designed to attract middle class individuals. Refined branch on the other side, will aim to attract customer with lower budget, but would still like to enjoy the service.
 
The Company started offering bedrock bathing services in the Shanghai outlet in January 2019. Different service packages are designed for each tier of service, which include option for subscription-based treatments, and pay per services. The packages offer customers either the option of purchasing our treatments at a discounted price if they purchase in bundle, or they can pay for the service every time they use at normal price.
