ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

(a) | General Description of Business

General
We are a diversified global producer of highly-engineered fabricated metal products. In our Engineered Support Structures (ESS) segment, we are a leading producer of steel, aluminum and composite poles, towers, and components for the global lighting, traffic, and wireless communications markets. The ESS segment also produces engineered access systems, highway safety products, and integrated structure solutions for smart cities. Our Utilities Support Structures (Utility) segment manufactures steel and concrete pole structures for global utility transmission, distribution and generation platforms primarily in the United States. The Utility segment also produces complex steel energy generation structures and engineered solar tracking solutions sold outside the United States. Our Irrigation segment is a global producer of mechanized irrigation systems, provider of water management solutions for large-scale production agriculture, and technology for precision agriculture. Our Coatings segment provides global galvanizing, painting and anodizing services to preserve and protect metal products. 
Our ESS segment sells the following products: outdoor lighting, traffic control, and roadway safety structures, wireless communication structures and components, and engineered access systems. Our Utility segment sells pole structures to support electrical transmission and distribution lines and related power distribution equipment. Our Irrigation segment produces mechanized irrigation equipment and related services that deliver water, chemical fertilizers and pesticides to agricultural crops. Our Coatings segment provides coatings services for Valmont and other industrial customers. Customers and end-users of our products include municipalities and government entities globally, manufacturers of commercial lighting fixtures (OEM), contractors, telecommunications and utility companies, and large farms as well as the general manufacturing sector. In 2018, approximately 34% of our net sales were either sold in markets or produced by our manufacturing plants outside of North America. We were founded in 1946, went public in 1968 and our shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: VMI).
Business Strategy
Our strategy is to pursue growth opportunities that leverage our existing product portfolio, knowledge of our principal end-markets and customers and engineering capability to increase our sales, earnings and cash flow, including:
Increasing the Market Penetration of our Existing Products. Our strategy is to increase our market penetration by differentiating our products from our competitors’ products through superior customer service, technological innovation and consistent high quality. For example, our Utility segment increased its 2018 sales by offering substations that are prepackaged to simplify our customer's installation and PyraMAX transmission structures. 
Bringing our Existing Products to New Markets. Our strategy is to expand the sales of our existing products into geographic areas where we do not currently serve and where end-users do not currently purchase our type of product. For example, we have expanded our geographic presence in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa for lighting structures. This strategy led to us building manufacturing presences in China and India to expand our offering of pole structures for lighting, utility and wireless communication to these markets. Our Irrigation segment has a long history of developing new emerging markets for mechanized irrigation around the world. In recent years, these markets include Eastern Europe and African countries. 
 Developing New Products for Markets that We Currently Serve. Our strategy is to grow by developing new products for markets using our comprehensive understanding of end-user requirements and leveraging longstanding relationships with key distributors and end-users. In recent years we developed and sold structures for tramway applications in Europe. The customers for this product line include many of the state and local governments that purchase our lighting structures. Another example is the development and expansion of decorative lighting poles that have been introduced to our existing customer base. Our 2018 acquisition of Walpar, an industry leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of overhead sign structures for the North America transportation market is an example of this strategy.

Developing New Products for New Markets or Leveraging Core Competencies to Further Diversify our Business is a path to increase sales. For example, the establishment and growth of our Coatings segment was based on using our expertise in galvanizing to develop what is now a global business segment. The decorative lighting market has different requirements and preferences than our traditional transportation and commercial markets. For example, our joint venture with Tehomet provided expertise in the decorative wood pole market. The 2018 acquisition of Convert Italia SpA , gave us a presence in engineered solar tracking products that we believe are complementary to our existing products and provide us with future growth opportunities. 
Acquisitions
We have grown internally and by acquisition. Our significant business expansions during the past five years include the following (including the segment where the business reports):
2014

• | Acquisition of 90% of a manufacturer of heavy complex steel structures (Valmont SM) with two manufacturing locations in Denmark (Utility)

(c) | Narrative Description of Business

Information concerning the principal products produced and services rendered, markets, competition and distribution methods for each of our four reportable segments is set forth below.
Engineered Support Structures Segment (ESS)
Products Produced—We engineer and manufacture steel, aluminum, and composite poles and structures to which lighting and traffic control fixtures are attached for a wide range of outdoor lighting applications, such as streets, highways, parking lots, sports stadiums and commercial and residential developments. The demand for these products is driven by infrastructure, commercial and residential construction and by consumers’ desire for well-lit streets, highways, parking lots and common areas to help make these areas safer at night and to support trends toward more active lifestyles and 24-hour convenience. In addition to safety, customers want products that are visually appealing. In Europe, we are a leader in decorative lighting poles, which are attractive as well as functional. We are leveraging this expertise to expand our decorative product sales in North America, China, and the Middle East. Traffic poles are structures to which traffic signals and overhead signs are attached and aid the orderly flow of automobile traffic. These poles are typically standard designs but can also be engineered to be slightly modified to meet customer specifications to ensure the proper function and safety of the structure. Product engineering takes into account factors such as weather (e.g. wind, ice) and the products loaded on the structure (e.g. lighting fixtures, traffic signals, overhead signs) to determine the design of the pole. This product line also includes roadway safety systems, including guard rail barriers, wire rope safety barriers, crash attenuation barriers and other products. Highway safety systems are also designed and engineered to enhance roadway safety.
We also engineer, manufacture, and distribute a broad range of structures (poles and towers), camouflage concealment solutions, and components serving the wireless communication market. A wireless communication cell site mainly consists of a steel pole or tower, shelter (enclosure where the radio equipment is located), antennas (devices that receive and transmit data and voice information to and from wireless communication devices) and components (items that are used to mount antennas to the structure and to connect cabling and other parts from the antennas to the shelter). Larger mono-pole structures are engineered and designed to customer specifications, which include factors such as the number of antennas on the structure and wind and soil conditions. Due to the size of these mono-pole structures, design is important to ensure each structure meets performance and safety specifications. We do not provide any significant installation services on the structures we sell or manufacture. We also produce and distribute access systems that allow people to move safely and effectively in an industrial, infrastructure or commercial facility. Products offered in this product line include floor gratings, handrails, barriers and sunscreens. We also produce a line of engineered products which are used in architectural applications. Examples of these products are perforated metal sun screens and facades that can be used on building structures to improve shading and aesthetics.  
Markets—The key markets for our lighting, traffic and roadway safety products are the transportation and commercial lighting markets and public roadway construction and upgrades. The transportation market includes street and highway lighting and traffic control, much of which is driven by government spending programs. For example, the U.S. government funds highway and road improvement through the federal highway program. This program provides funding to improve the nation’s roadway system, which includes roadway lighting and traffic control enhancements. Matching funding from the various states may be required as a condition of federal funding. Some states are supplementing infrastructure funding with revenue sources. Public and private partnerships have recently emerged as an additional funding source. The current federal highway program was renewed and extended in late 2015. The current administration has recommended 
4

increases to spending on roadway infrastructure. In the United States, there are approximately 4 million miles of public roadways, with approximately 24% carrying over 80% of the traffic. Accordingly, the need to improve traffic flow through traffic controls and lighting is a priority for many communities. Transportation markets in other areas of the world are also heavily funded by local and national governments. 
The commercial lighting market is mostly funded privately and includes lighting for applications such as parking lots, shopping centers, sports stadiums and business parks. The commercial lighting market is driven by macro-economic factors such as general economic growth rates, interest rates and the commercial construction economy. Valmont has many long-standing relationships with OEM’s who serve this market. Markets for access systems are typically driven by infrastructure, industrial and commercial construction spending. Customers include construction firms or installers who participate in these markets, natural gas and mineral exploration companies, resellers such as steel service centers, and end users. These markets can be cyclical depending on economic conditions. 
The market for our communication products is driven by increased demand for wireless communication and data. Customers are wireless network providers and organizations that own cell sites and attach antennas from multiple carriers to the pole or tower structure (build to suit companies). We also sell products to state and federal governments for two-way radio communication, radar, broadcasting and security applications. We believe long-term growth should mainly be driven by increased usage and technologies such as 5G, which demand higher network density. Improved emergency response systems, as part of the U.S. Homeland Security initiatives, creates additional demand. 
All of the products that we manufacture in this segment are parts of government or customer investments in basic infrastructure. The total cost of these investments can be substantial, so access to capital is often important to fund infrastructure needs. Demand can be cyclical in these markets due to overall economic conditions. Additionally, projects can sometimes be delayed due to funding or other issues.
Competition—Our competitive strategy in all of the markets we serve is to provide high value to the customer at a reasonable price. We compete on the basis of product quality, high levels of customer service, timely, complete, and accurate delivery of the product and design capability to provide the best solutions to our customers. There are numerous competitors in our markets, most of which are relatively small companies. Companies compete on the basis of price, product quality, reliable delivery, engineering design, and unique product features. Pricing can be very competitive, especially when demand is weak or when strong local currencies result in increased competition from imported products.
Distribution Methods—Sales and distribution activities are handled through a combination of a direct sales force and commissioned agents. Lighting agents represent Valmont as well as lighting fixture companies and sell other related products. Sales are typically to electrical distributors, who provide the pole, fixtures and other equipment to the end user as a complete package. Commercial lighting, wireless communication products and components, access systems and highway safety sales are normally made through Valmont sales employees, who work on a salary plus incentive, although some sales are made through independent, commissioned sales agents.
Utility Support Structures Segment (Utility)
Products Produced—We engineer and manufacture tapered steel, pre-stressed concrete and hybrid structures (concrete base section and steel upper sections), and steel lattice structures. These products are used to support the lines that carry power for electrical transmission, substation and distribution applications. Transmission refers to moving power from where it is produced to where it is used. Substations transfer high voltage electricity to low voltage transmission. Electrical distribution carries electricity from the substation to the end-user. We also design and engineer single axis solar tracker solutions for utility-scale solar applications. 
Utility structures can be very large, so product design engineering is important to the function and safety of the structure. Our engineering process takes into account weather and loading conditions, such as wind speeds, ice loads and the power lines attached to the structure, in order to arrive at the final design. In Northern Europe, we produce utility structures for offshore and onshore wind energy. We also manufacture complex steel structures such as rotor houses for wind turbines, crown-mounted compensators, winches and cranes for oil and gas exploration, and material handling equipment for manufacturing. 
Markets—Our sales in this segment are mainly in North America, where the key drivers in the utility business are significant upgrades in the electrical grid to support enhanced reliability standards, policy changes encouraging more 
5

generation from renewable energy sources, interconnection of regional grids to share more efficient generation to the benefit of the consumer and increased electrical consumption which has outpaced the transmission investment in the past decades. According to the Edison Electric Institute, the electrical transmission grid in the U.S. requires significant investment in the coming years to respond to the compelling industry drivers and lack of investment prior to 2008. In international markets, electrical consumption is expected to increase. This will require substantial investment in new electricity generation capacity and growth in transmission grid development. We expect these factors to result in increased demand for electrical utility structures to transport electricity from source to user, as is used in the U.S. markets today. As utilities increase development of large-scale solar power and micro-grid applications, single axis tracker solutions will be an essential tool for achieving higher energy production. Sales of complex steel structures, wind turbine towers and rotor houses, material handling systems, utility transmission structures, and structures for oil & gas exploration mainly occur within Europe.
Competition—Our competitive strategy in this segment is to provide high value solutions to the customer at a reasonable price. We compete on the basis of product quality, engineering expertise, high levels of customer service and reliable, timely delivery of the product. There are many competitors. Companies compete on the basis of price, quality and service. Utility sales are often made through a competitive bid process, whereby the lowest bidder is awarded the contract, provided the competitor meets all other qualifying criteria. In weak markets, price is a more important criteria in the bid process. We also sell on a preferred-provider basis to certain large utility customers. These contractual arrangements often last between 3 and 5 years and are frequently renewed. For offshore and complex steel structures, we compete based on our ability to co-engineer and design solutions with customers. We are one of a limited number of competitors that can execute advanced order production of complex steel constructions that entail electronics, hydraulics, and highly automated series production for very customized products. 
Distribution Methods—Products are normally sold directly to electrical utilities or energy providers with some sales sold through commissioned sales agents.
Coatings Segment (Coatings)
Services Rendered—We add finishes to metals that inhibit corrosion, extend service lives and enhance physical attractiveness of a wide range of materials and products. Among the services provided include:

• | Hot-dip Galvanizing


• | Anodizing


• | Powder Coating


• | E-Coating

In our Coatings segment, we take unfinished products from our customers and return them with a galvanized, anodized or painted finish. Galvanizing is a process that protects steel with a zinc coating that is bonded to the product surface to inhibit rust and corrosion. Anodizing is a process applied to aluminum that oxidizes the surface of the aluminum in a controlled manner, which protects the aluminum from corrosion and allows the material to be dyed a variety of colors. We also paint products using powder coating and e-coating technology (where paint is applied through an electrical charge) for a number of industries and markets.
Markets—Markets for our products are varied and our profitability is not substantially dependent on any one industry or external customer. However, a meaningful percentage of demand is internal, driven by Valmont's other segments. Demand for coatings services generally follows the local industrial economies. Galvanizing is used in a wide variety of industrial applications where corrosion protection of steel is desired. While markets are varied, our markets for anodized or painted products are more directly dependent on consumer markets than industrial markets.
Competition—The Coatings markets traditionally have been very fragmented, with a large number of competitors. Most of these competitors are relatively small, privately held companies who compete on the basis of price and personal relationships with their customers. As a result of ongoing industry consolidation, there are also several (public and private) multi-facility competitors. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of quality of the coating finish and timely delivery of the coated product to the customer. We also use the production capacity at our network of plants to ensure that the customer receives quality, timely service.
6

Distribution Methods—Due to freight costs, a galvanizing location has an effective service area of an approximate 300 to 500 mile radius. While we believe that we are globally one of the largest custom galvanizers, our sales are a small percentage of the total market. Sales and customer service are provided directly to the user by a direct sales force, generally assigned to each specific location.
Irrigation Segment (Irrigation)
Products Produced—We manufacture and distribute mechanical irrigation equipment and related service parts under the “Valley” brand name. A Valley irrigation machine usually is powered by electricity and propels itself over a farm field and applies water and chemicals to crops. Water and, in some instances, chemicals are applied through sprinklers attached to a pipeline that is supported by a series of towers, each of which is propelled via a drive train and tires. A standard mechanized irrigation machine (also known as a “center pivot”) rotates in a circle, although we also manufacture and distribute center pivot extensions that can irrigate corners of square and rectangular farm fields as well as conform to irregular field boundaries (referred to as a “corner” machine). Our irrigation machines can also irrigate fields by moving up and down the field as opposed to rotating in a circle (referred to as a “linear” machine). Irrigation machines can be configured to irrigate fields in size from 4 acres to over 500 acres, with a standard size in the U.S. configured for a 160-acre tract of ground. One of the key components of our irrigation machine is the control system. This is the part of the machine that allows the machine to be operated in the manner preferred by the grower, offering control of such factors as on/off timing, individual field sector control, rate and depth of water and chemical application. Our advanced technology solutions include a suite of smart panels and remote management of irrigation machines through smartphone, tablet, or centralized computer control. Irrigation net sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016 included technology sales of $45.3 million, $43.4 million, and $26.5 million, respectively. We also offer customized water application and scheduling services, which provide forecast information to assist growers in determining precision of water application on the field. Our water management group also provides product and service sales related to the delivery of water through mechanized irrigation equipment. The irrigation machine used in international markets is substantially the same as the one produced for the North American market.
Other Types of Irrigation — There are other forms of irrigation available to farmers, two of the most prevalent being flood irrigation and drip irrigation. In flood irrigation, water is applied through a pipe or canal at the top of the field and allowed to run down the field by gravity. Drip irrigation involves plastic pipe or tape resting on the surface of the field or buried a few inches below ground level, with water being applied gradually. We estimate that center pivot and linear irrigation comprises 50% of the irrigated acreage in North America. International markets use predominantly flood irrigation.
The Company through its majority ownership in AgSense LLC, develops and markets remote monitoring technology for pivot irrigation systems that is sold on a subscription basis. AgSense technology allows growers to remotely monitor and operate irrigation equipment and other farm implements. Data management and control is achieved using applications running on either a desktop Internet browser or various mobile devices connected to the Internet. We also manufacture tubular products for industrial customers primarily in the agriculture industry as well as in the transportation and other industries. 
Markets—Market drivers in North America and international markets are essentially the same. Since the purchase of an irrigation machine is a capital expenditure, the purchase decision is based on the expected return on investment. The benefits a grower may realize through investment in mechanical irrigation include improved yields through better irrigation, cost savings through reduced labor and lower water and energy usage. The purchase decision is also affected by current and expected net farm income, commodity prices, interest rates, the status of government support programs and water regulations in local areas. In many international markets, the relative strength or weakness of local currencies as compared with the U.S. dollar may affect net farm income, since export markets are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, governments are sponsoring irrigation projects for self-sufficiency in food production. 
The demand for mechanized irrigation comes from the following sources:

• | conversion from flood irrigation


• | replacement of existing mechanized irrigation machines


• | converting land that is not irrigated to mechanized irrigation

One of the key drivers in our Irrigation segment worldwide is that the usable water supply is limited. We estimate that:
7


• | only 2.5% of total worldwide water supply is freshwater


• | of that 2.5%, only 30% of freshwater is available to humans


• | the largest user of that freshwater is agriculture

We believe these factors, along with the trend of a growing worldwide population and improving diets, reflect the need to use water more efficiently while increasing food production to feed this growing population. We believe that mechanized irrigation can improve water application efficiency by 40-90% compared with traditional irrigation methods by applying water uniformly near the root zone and reducing water runoff. Furthermore, reduced water runoff improves water quality in nearby rivers, aquifers and streams, thereby providing environmental benefits in addition to conservation of water.
Competition—In North America, there are a number of entities that provide irrigation products and services to agricultural customers. We believe we are the leader of the four main participants in the mechanized irrigation business. Participants compete for sales on the basis of price, product innovation and features, product durability and reliability, quality and service capabilities of the local dealer. Pricing can become very competitive, especially in periods when market demand is low. In international markets, our competitors are a combination of our major U.S. competitors and privately‑owned local companies. Competitive factors are similar to those in North America, although pricing tends to be a more prevalent competitive strategy in international markets. Since competition in international markets is local, we believe local manufacturing capability is important to competing effectively in international markets and we have that capability in key regions.
Distribution Methods—We market our irrigation machines, technology offerings, and service parts through independent dealers. There are approximately 270 dealer locations in North America, with another approximately 270 dealers serving international markets in over 60 countries. The dealer determines the grower’s requirements, designs the configuration of the machine, installs the machine (including providing ancillary products that deliver water and electrical power to the machine) and provides after‑sales service. Our dealer network is supported and trained by our technical and sales teams. Our international dealers are supported through our regional headquarters in South America, South Africa, Western Europe, Australia, China and the United Arab Emirates as well as the home office in Valley, Nebraska.
General
Certain information generally applicable to each of our four reportable segments is set forth below.
Suppliers and Availability of Raw Materials.
Hot rolled steel coil and plate, zinc and other carbon steel products are the primary raw materials utilized in the manufacture of finished products for all segments. We purchase these essential items from steel mills, steel service centers, and zinc producers and these materials are usually readily available. While we may experience increased lead times to acquire materials and volatility in our purchase costs, we do not believe that key raw materials would be unavailable for extended periods. We have not experienced extended or wide-spread shortages of steel in the past several years, due to what we believe are strong relationships with some of the major steel producers. In the past several years, we experienced volatility in zinc and natural gas prices, but we did not experience any disruptions to our operations due to availability.
Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions.
We have a number of patents for our manufacturing machinery, poles and irrigation designs. We also have a number of registered trademarks. We do not believe the loss of any individual patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Seasonal Factors in Business.
Sales can be somewhat seasonal based upon the agricultural growing season and the infrastructure construction season. Sales of mechanized irrigation equipment to farmers are traditionally higher during the spring and fall and lower in the summer. Sales of infrastructure products are traditionally higher in the summer and fall and lower in the winter.
8

Customers.
We are not dependent for a material part of any segment’s business upon a single customer or upon very few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Backlog.
The backlog of orders for the principal products manufactured and marketed was $644.7 million at the end of the 2018 fiscal year and $670.0 million at the end of the 2017 fiscal year. An order is reported in our backlog upon receipt of a purchase order from the customer or execution of a sales order contract. We anticipate that most of the 2018 backlog of orders will be filled during fiscal year 2019. At year-end, the segments with backlog were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

 | 12/29/2018 | | 12/30/2017
Engineered Support Structures | $ | 257.4 | | | $ | 204.1
Utility Support Structures | 325.9 | | | 359.1 |
