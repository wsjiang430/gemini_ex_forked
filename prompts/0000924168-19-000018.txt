ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

The Company was founded in 1985 as Fiberstars, Inc., a California corporation, and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2006. In May 2007, Fiberstars, Inc. merged with and became Energy Focus, Inc., also a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 32000 Aurora Road, Suite B, Solon, Ohio 44139. Our telephone number is 440.715.1300. Our website address is www.energyfocus.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report.
Energy Focus, Inc. and its subsidiary engage in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of energy-efficient lighting systems. We operate in a single industry segment, developing and selling our energy-efficient light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting products into the general commercial, industrial and military maritime markets. Our goal is to become a trusted leader in the LED lighting retrofit market by replacing fluorescent lamps in institutional buildings and high-intensity discharge (“HID”) lighting in low-bay and high-bay applications with our innovative, high-quality commercial and military tubular LED (“TLED”) products.

In 2018, we made significant strides in expanding and diversifying our new product portfolio. We introduced six new product families, including our commercial fixture family, our double-ended ballast bypass T8 and T5 high-output TLEDs, our Navy highbay retrofit kit, the Invisitube ultra-low EMI TLED and our dimmable industrial downlight. Our new products, including the RedCap emergency battery backup tube introduced in Q4 2017, have gained traction, with sales of new products introduced in the past two years increasing from less than one percent of total revenue in Q4 2017 to 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, the highest new product revenue in the last two years. Our legacy military luminaire product line, including our flood, waterline security lights, globes and berth lights grew by over 90 percent from 2017 to 2018 and we saw some return of our military Intellitube® sales, as we achieved more competitive pricing through our cost reductions. During the year, we reduced the costs of eight legacy product families in order to price our products more competitively. Despite these efforts, the pricing of our legacy products remains at the high end of the competitive range and we expect aggressive price erosion to continue to be a headwind until our more innovative and differentiated new products ramp in volume.
During 2018, we continued to streamline our operations to build on the restructuring initiative implemented during the first quarter of 2017, which included an organizational consolidation of management functions, the addition of a hybrid sales model, combining our existing direct sales force with sales agencies to expand our market presence throughout the U.S. and the closing of several offices, and resulted in significantly decreased operating expenses from 2016 levels. 
Despite progress in these areas, our 2018 results reflect continued challenges due to long and unpredictable sales cycles, delays in customer retrofit budgets and project starts, continuing aggressive price competition and a lower priced legacy product portfolio that was not available until the end of 2018 and impacted the development timeline for our next generation smart lighting products. 
Over the past several months, we have evaluated and pursued, and expect to continue to assess the Company’s strategic options, as we seek additional external funding sources and to achieve a profitable business model and maximize value for our stockholders. Our ongoing plans to achieve profitability include continuing to develop new technologies into differentiated and sustainable product lines that allow us to effectively compete to expand our customer base, execute our marketing and sales plans, and continue to improve our supply chain and organizational structure.
Our industry
We develop advanced LED retrofit solutions that enable our customers to run their facilities with greater energy efficiency, productivity and employee wellness. We achieve this by being a technology leader, providing high-quality, energy-efficient, “flicker-free”, long-lived, and mercury-free TLED products to replace existing linear fluorescent lamp products in general purpose lighting applications and HID lamps in low-bay and high bay lighting applications. We believe these applications represent a dominant portion of the LED lighting market and energy savings potential for our targeted commercial, industrial and military maritime markets. 
LED lighting, and particularly LED retrofit of fluorescent and incandescent lights in existing buildings, represents a large and growing market.We estimate the 2017 North American commercial and industrial linear fixtures market, including retrofit applications, to be approximately $16.0 billion. A 2018 report by Navigant Research entitled, “Tubular LEDs,” forecasts that TLEDs, the segment most important to Energy Focus, will grow at a 7.6% compound annual growth rate from 2018 to 2027. LEDs are still in the very early phases of adoption in our target markets. IBIS Industry Reports projects that, by 2020, healthcare, education, commercial and industrial markets will still only be 17% to 18% penetrated, leaving a large opportunity

for future growth. The increasing demand for LED lighting is being driven by energy and cost savings, environmental considerations and human health.
Energy consumption can be reduced by approximately 50% by replacing fluorescent tubes with LED tubes and by another 50% (75% total) by utilizing smart lighting technologies, including dimmable TLEDs with ambient light and occupancy sensors. For this reason, building codes are increasingly requiring not only LEDs, but dimmable LEDs. Governments around the world are implementing regulations and standards that incentivize the use of LED lighting, both smart and conventional, to reduce energy consumption and, therefore, carbon dioxide emissions. In 2018, our new product research and development investments were focused on smart lighting technologies to capitalize on these trends. 
There is a growing awareness in the industry of the profound influence lighting can have on human health and well being. The interference of blue light with human circadian rhythms is well known. This can be alleviated by smart lighting techniques that change the correlated color temperature (“CCT”) of the LEDs depending on the time of day in order to emulate natural light. Flicker, which is the modulation of the intensity of LED light at the frequency of the power supply, is well known to cause headaches, eye strain, fatigue, mood triggers and other health issues as well as interfering with electronic equipment such as barcode scanners. The Department of Energy (“DOE”), which has been a leading advocate of the solid-state lighting (“SSL”) revolution, presented a report at LightFair in May 2018, supporting these and other findings. For these reasons, there is growing demand for flicker-free LED lighting, particularly in healthcare and education where concentration, learning and wellness are imperative. Energy Focus tubes are UL-certified at less than 1% optical flicker, positioning us well to capitalize on this growing opportunity.
Smart, or connected, lighting is disrupting the LED industry and providing new opportunities for growth. The DOE defines connected lighting as an LED lighting system with integrated sensors and controllers that are networked, enabling lighting products within the system to communicate with each other and transmit data. In addition to enabling the intensity and CCT of lights to respond to ambient light, time of day and the activities of building occupants, connectivity enables building automation functions that extend well beyond lighting. Examples include asset tracking, indoor wayfinding, location-based services, air quality, humidity, smoke, fire and carbon monoxide detection, security and surveillance, and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Since lighting sockets are ubiquitous and have access to power, tubes and fixtures are ideal vehicles to retrofit these capabilities into existing buildings. Our next generation smart lighting product portfolio, in development, capitalizes on these opportunities. 
While the market is large, growing and underpenetrated, it has also been characterized in recent years by an increasing number of competitors, aggressive price erosion and commoditization. Our strategy to combat these trends is to move up the value chain by developing solutions that address unmet customer needs with differentiated products, such as our emergency battery backup and smart lighting platform, that deliver greater value to our customers.
Our products and strengths

Our LED products are more energy-efficient than traditional lighting products, such as incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, and we believe they can provide significant long-term energy and maintenance cost savings, reduce carbon emissions and improve the sustainability profile of our customers.
The key features of our products are as follows:


• | Many of our products make use of proprietary optical and electronics delivery systems that enable high efficiencies with superior lighting qualities and proven records of extremely high product reliability.


• | Our products have exceptionally long life and are backed by a 10-year warranty.


• | Our products have extremely low flicker. Optical flicker, or fluctuations in brightness over time, is largely invisible to the human eye, but has been proven to exert stress on the human brain, causing headaches and eye strain, which reduce occupant comfort and productivity. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”) one of the world's largest technical professional society promoting the development and application of electrotechnology and allied sciences for the benefit of humanity, recommends optical flicker of five percent or less. Our 500D series TLED products are certified by Underwriters Laboratories (“UL®”) as “low optical flicker, less than 1%”. 


• | Many of our products meet the lighting efficiency standards mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.


• | Many of our products qualify for federal and state tax and rebate incentives for commercial consumers available in certain states.

Our product development strengths, which we believe provide a strategic competitive advantage, include the following:


• | A long research, engineering, and market developmental history, with broad and intimate understanding of lighting technologies and LED lighting applications;


• | Concentration on developing and providing high-quality, price competitive TLED lamps to replace fluorescent and HID lamps for commercial markets;


• | Providing high quality and high performing LED and TLED products with a proven history of reliability; and


• | A deep understanding of the adoption dynamics and decision-making process for LED lighting products in existing commercial building markets.


As we seek to develop new connected lighting LED solutions, we have invested in connected lighting research and development activities and partnerships. The DOE Report estimated that as of 2015, the penetration rates for any type of lighting controls to be 32 percent for commercial applications and six percent for industrial applications. Lighting controls, including dimming, sensor and daylighting technologies, can yield significant energy savings. The controllability of LED technology and the ability to integrate sensing, data processing and network interface hardware into our existing products will allow us to further differentiate our LED solutions and provide greater value to our customers.
Sales and marketing

We have a hybrid sales model, combining our existing direct sales force with sales agencies to expand our market presence throughout the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, we expanded our sales coverage to the entire U.S. through six geographic regions and 50 sales agencies, each of which has, on average, 10 agents representing Energy Focus products. As a result of this transition, we have substantially expanded from a primarily Midwest focus to build market presence and awareness in other regions of the U.S. with significant demand potential, including the Northeast, Southeast and California.
We focus on markets where the economic benefits and technical specifications of our lighting product offerings are most compelling. Our LED lighting products fall into two separate applications, commercial markets, focused on quality, efficacy, total cost of ownership and return on investment, and military maritime markets, requiring higher military specifications for durability and dependability.
With the introduction of our military Intellitube® product in 2011, our results historically had been driven by our military maritime market, until the competitive landscape changed in late 2016 due to the entrance of new competitors, drastic decline in pricing and limited remaining opportunities.
In light of the changing military maritime market, over the past several years we have continued to diversify our military maritime business through the development of LED fixtures, globe and berth lights and our continued efforts to expand sales beyond the U.S. Navy, and have been focused on expanding our commercial and industrial market presence where the

economic benefits and technical specifications of our lighting product offerings are compelling, such as the healthcare, education and industrial verticals. For example:

• | Given the 24/7 lighting requirements of hospital systems we believe that our LED solutions offer the quality, performance, long lifetime, return on investment and low flicker lightning that is particularly attractive to this target market. Since 2015 we have been the trusted LED lighting partner for a major northeast Ohio hospital system and as a result of our continued success, we have been able to leverage this relationship to introduce our lighting solutions and value proposition to an increasing number of hospital systems.


• | As we advocate for the benefits of low flicker LED lighting in schools, both in terms of energy-efficiency and in creating a healthy and effective learning environment, we continue to receive orders to retrofit local school districts, colleges and universities.


• | Low and high bay applications are generally used in commercial and industrial markets to provide light to large open areas like big-box retail stores, warehouses and manufacturing facilities. In the past few years, technological and cost improvements have allowed LED low and high bay applications to be more competitive against traditional low and high bay applications. In the industrial market in particular, due to the usage of HID lighting, the energy savings that can be achieved by switching to our LED products could be substantial and we believe we have attractive product offerings in this space.

Concentration of sales

In 2018, one customer, a distributor to the U.S. Navy, accounted for 41.9 percent of net sales and total sales to distributors to the U.S. Navy represented 46.2 percent of net sales. In 2017, three customers accounted for 48.4 percent of net sales. In 2017, two commercial customers, a major northeastern Ohio hospital system and a large regional retrofit company located in Texas accounted for 18.3 percent, and 12.8 percent of net sales, respectively, while sales to a distributor to the U.S. Navy accounted for 17.3 percent of net sales. Total sales to distributors to the U.S. Navy represented 22.0 percent of net sales in 2017.
Competition

Our LED lighting products compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and HID lamps, as well as other TLEDs and full fixture lighting products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance and lower total cost of ownership of our products. Principal competitors in our markets include large lamp manufacturers and lighting fixture companies based in the U.S., as well as TLED manufacturers mostly based in Asia, whose financial resources may substantially exceed and cost structure may be well below ours. These competitors may introduce new or improved products that may reduce or eliminate some of the competitive advantage of our products, and may have substantially lower pricing. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and/or advanced features. We compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies such as Philips Lighting, Ideal Industries, Osram Sylvania and GE Lighting, as well as, smaller manufacturers or distributors such as LED Smart, Revolution Lighting Technologies and Orion Energy Systems. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products.

Manufacturing and suppliers
We produce our lighting products and systems through a combination of internal manufacturing and assembly at our Solon, Ohio facility, and sourced finished goods, manufactured to our specifications. Our internal lighting system manufacturing consists primarily of final assembly, testing, and quality control. We have worked with several vendors to design custom components to meet our specific needs. Our quality assurance program provides for testing of all sub-assemblies at key stages in the assembly process, as well as testing of finished products produced both internally and sourced through third parties.
Manufacturing costs are managed through the balance of internal production and an outsourced production model for certain parts and components, as well as finished goods in specific product lines, to a small number of vendors in various locations throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Taiwan, and China. In some cases, we rely upon a single supplier to source certain components, sub-assemblies, or finished goods. We continually attempt to improve our global supply chain practices to satisfy client demands in terms of quality and volumes, while controlling our costs and achieving targeted gross margins, and this includes the evaluation of additional outsourcing of internal production where cost, quality and performance can be maintained or improved.

Product development

Product development has been a key area of operating focus and competitive differentiation for us in designing and developing industry leading LED lighting products. Gross product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $2.6 million, $2.9 million, and $3.6 million respectively. 

Intellectual property

We have a policy of seeking to protect our intellectual property through patents, license agreements, trademark registrations, confidential disclosure agreements, and trade secrets as management deems appropriate. Certain of our patents are key to our current product lines. Additionally, we have various pending United States patent applications, and various pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization that serve as the basis for national patent filings in countries of interest. Our issued patents expire at various times through July 2032. Generally, the term of patent protection is twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. There can be no assurance; however, that our issued patents are valid or that any patents applied for will be issued, and that our competitors or clients will not copy aspects of our lighting systems or obtain information that we regard as proprietary. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop products similar to ours. The laws of some foreign countries in which we manufacture, sell or may sell our products do not protect proprietary rights to products to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

Insurance

All of our properties and equipment are covered by insurance and we believe that such insurance is adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance in amounts we believe to be consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.
Employees

At December 31, 2018, we had 58 full-time employees, five of whom were located in Taiwan and 53 in the United States. We also had eight temporary contract employees at December 31, 2018. None of our employees or contract employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Business segments

We currently operate in a single business segment that includes the marketing and sale of commercial and military maritime lighting products.
