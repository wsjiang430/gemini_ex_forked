Item 1.    Business
Our Company
We are one of the leading providers of parking management, ground transportation services, baggage services and other ancillary services to commercial, hospitality, institutional, municipal and governmental, and aviation clients across the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. These services include on-site parking management, valet parking, ground transportation services, facility maintenance, event logistics, baggage handling services, remote airline check-in services, security services, municipal meter revenue collection and enforcement services, and consulting services. We schedule and supervise service personnel as well as provide customer service, marketing, accounting and revenue control functions necessary to provide such services. 
Acquisitions, Investment in Joint Venture and Sale of Business
On November 30, 2018, we acquired the outstanding shares of Baggage Airline Guest Services, Inc. and Home Serv Delivery, LLC, and their subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "Bags"), for an all-cash purchase price of $277.9 million, net of $5.9 million of cash acquired. Bags is a leading provider of baggage services, remote airline check-in, and other related services, primarily to airline, airport and hospitality clients. Bags provides these services by combining exceptional customer service with innovative technologies. Based in Orlando, Florida, Bags operates in over 250 cities in North America with approximately 3,000 employees. Its clients include major airlines, airports, sea ports, cruise lines, and leading hotels and resorts. Bags handles more than 5 million checked bags annually. 
In October 2014, we entered into an agreement to establish a joint venture with Parkmobile USA, Inc. ("Parkmobile USA"), pursuant to which we contributed all of the assets and liabilities of our proprietary Click and Park® parking prepayment business in exchange for a 30% interest in the newly formed legal entity called Parkmobile, LLC ("Parkmobile"). Parkmobile is a leading provider of on-demand and prepaid transaction processing for on- and off-street parking and ground transportation services. The Parkmobile joint venture combined two parking transaction engines: SP Plus contributed its Click and Park® parking prepayment systems, which enables consumers to reserve and pay for parking online in advance and Parkmobile USA contributed its on demand transaction engine that allows consumers to transact real-time payment for parking privileges in both on- and off-street environments. We historically accounted for our investment in the Parkmobile joint venture under the equity method of accounting. On January 3, 2018, we closed a transaction to sell our entire 30% Parkmobile interest to Parkmobile USA, Inc. for a gross sale price of $19.0 million. As a result of this sale, in the first quarter of 2018 we recognized a pre-tax gain of $10.1 million, net of closing costs, which is included in Equity in (earnings) losses from investment in unconsolidated entity within the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In August 2015, we signed an agreement to sell and subsequently sold portions of our security business primarily operating in the Southern California market to a third-party for a gross sales price of $1.8 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of business of $0.5 million, net of legal and other expenses. The pre-tax profit for the operations of the security business was not significant to the periods presented herein. The Company received $0.6 million for the final earn-out consideration from the buyer during the second quarter of 2017, for which we recognized an additional gain of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Our Operations
Our history and resulting experience has allowed us to develop and standardize a rigorous system of processes and controls that enable us to deliver consistent, transparent, value-added and high-quality parking management, ground transportation services, baggage services and other ancillary services. We serve a variety of industries and have industry vertical specific specialization in commercial real estate, residential communities, hotels and resorts, airports, airlines, cruise lines, healthcare facilities, municipalities and government facilities, retail operations, large event venues, and colleges and universities. 
2
We operate under two primary types of arrangements: management type contracts and lease type contracts.

• | Under a management type contract, we typically receive a fixed and/or variable monthly fee for providing our services, and we may also receive an incentive fee based on the achievement of certain performance objectives. We also receive fees for ancillary services. Typically, all of the underlying revenue and expenses under a standard management type contract flow through to our client rather than to us.


• | Under a lease type contract, we generally pay to the client either a fixed annual rent, a percentage of gross customer collections, or a combination of both. Under a lease type contract, we collect all revenue and are responsible for most operating expenses, but typically are not responsible for major maintenance, capital expenditures or real estate taxes.

Our revenue is derived from a broad and diverse group of clients, industry vertical markets and geographies. Our clients include some of North America's largest private and public owners, municipalities and governments, managers and developers of major office buildings, residential properties, commercial properties, shopping centers and other retail properties, healthcare facilities and medical centers, sports and special event complexes, hotels and resorts, airlines and cruise lines. No single client accounted for more than 4% of our revenue, net of reimbursed management type contract revenue, or more than 4% of our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, we have built a diverse geographic footprint that as of December 31, 2018 included operations in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and three Canadian provinces. Our strategy is focused on building scale and leadership positions in large, strategic markets in order to leverage the advantages of scale across a larger number of clients in a single market.
While large shares of our operating arrangements are fixed-fee management type contracts, we continue to grow our lease type contracts and management type contract businesses. Generally, management type contracts provide us with insulation from economic cycles and enhance our earnings visibility because our management type contract revenue generally does not fluctuate materially in relation to variations in customer volume; our lease type contracts may experience greater variability, as revenues typically increase in periods of improving macroeconomic conditions through increased customer volumes and typically decrease during periods of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions through reduced customer volumes.
Services
As a professional service provider, we provide comprehensive, turn-key service offering packages to our clients. Under a typical management type contract structure, we are responsible for providing and supervising all personnel necessary to facilitate daily operations, which may include cashiers, porters, baggage handlers, valet attendants, managers, bookkeepers, and a variety of ground transportation services, maintenance, marketing, customer service, and accounting and revenue control functions.
Beyond the conventional management services described above, we also offer an expanded range of ground transportation services, baggage delivery and other ancillary services. For example, we provide:

• | shuttle bus vehicles and the drivers to operate them serving locations such as on-airport car rental operations and private off-airport parking locations;


• | ground transportation services, such as taxi and livery dispatch services, as well as concierge-type ground transportation information and support services for arriving passengers with transportation network companies;


• | baggage services, including delivery of delayed luggage and baggage handling services;


• | remote airline check-in services;


• | wheelchair assist services to airports and airline passengers;


• | baggage repair and replacement services;


• | on-street parking meter collection and other forms of parking enforcement services;


• | valet services, including vehicle staging, doorman/bellman services and valet tracking systems with text-for-car capabilities;


• | remote parking management services using technology that enables us to monitor parking operations from a remote, off-site location and provide 24-hour-a-day customer assistance (including remedying equipment malfunctions);


• | innovative and environmentally compliant facility maintenance services, including power sweeping and washing, painting and general repairs, as well as cleaning and seasonal services;


• | comprehensive security services including the training and hiring of security officers and patrol, as well as customized services and technology that are efficient and appropriate for the property involved; and


• | multi-platform marketing services including SP+ branded websites which offer clients a unique platform for marketing their facilities, mobile apps, search marketing, email marketing and social media campaigns.

Industry Overview
Overview
The parking management, ground transportation services and baggage service industries are large and fragmented. A substantial number of companies in these industries offer parking management services, ground transportation services and baggage services as non-core operations, and companies in these industries are large national competitors or small, private and operate in limited markets and geographies. Additionally, technological advancements are having an impact on both consumer behavior and information technology in these industries. From time to time, smaller operators find they lack the financial resources, economies of scale and/or management techniques required to compete for the business of increasingly sophisticated clients and the increasing demands of clients. We expect this trend to continue and will provide larger professional service companies with greater opportunities to expand their businesses and acquire smaller operators. We also expect that small new operators will continue to enter the market as they have in the past.
Industry Operating Arrangements
Professional service businesses operate primarily under two general types of arrangements:

• | management type contracts; and


• | lease type contracts.

The general terms and benefits of these two types of arrangements are as follows:
Management Type Contract
Under a management type contract, the professional service operator generally receives a fixed and/or variable monthly fee for providing services and may receive an incentive fee based on the achievement of certain performance objectives. Professional service operators also generally charge fees for various ancillary services such as accounting support services, equipment leasing and consulting. Primary responsibilities under a management type contract include hiring, training and staffing personnel, and providing revenue collection, accounting, record-keeping, insurance and marketing services. The client is usually responsible for operating expenses associated with the client's operations, such as taxes, license and permit fees, insurance costs, payroll and accounts receivable processing and wages of personnel assigned to the operation, although some management type contracts, typically referred to as "reverse" management type contracts, require the professional service operator to pay certain of these cost categories but provide for payment to the operator of a larger management fee. Under a management type contract, the client usually is responsible for non-routine maintenance and repairs and capital improvements of the operation facility or location, such as structural and significant mechanical repairs. Management type contracts are typically for a term of one to three years (although the contracts may often be terminated, without cause, on 30-days' notice or less) and may contain renewal clauses.
Lease Type Contract
Under a lease type contract, the services operator generally pays to the client or property owner a fixed base rent or fee, percentage rent that is tied to the financial performance of the operation, or a combination of both. The professional services operator collects all revenue and is responsible for most operating expenses, but typically is not responsible for major maintenance, capital expenditures or real estate taxes. In contrast to management type contracts, lease type contracts typically have longer terms of three to ten years, and often contain a renewal term and provide for a fixed payment to the client regardless of the facility's operating earnings. Many of these lease type contracts may be canceled by the client for various reasons, including development of the real estate for other uses, and other leases may be canceled by the client on as little as 30 days' notice without cause. Lease type contracts generally require larger capital investment by the services operator than do management type contracts and therefore tend to have longer contract periods.
General Business Trends
We believe that our clients recognize the potential for parking services, parking management, ground transportation services, baggage services and other ancillary services to be a profit generator and/or a service differentiator to their respective customers. By outsourcing these services, they are able to capture additional profit and enhance the customer experience by leveraging the unique operational skills and controls that an experienced services company can offer. Our ability to consistently deliver a uniformly high level of services to our clients, including the use of various technological enhancements, allows us to maximize the profit and enhance the customer experience for our clients, thereby improving our ability to win contracts and retain existing clients.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following key competitive strengths:

• | A Leading Market Position with a Unique Value Proposition. We are one of the leading providers of parking management, ground transportation services, baggage services and other ancillary services to commercial, hospitality, institutional, municipal and government, airports, airlines and cruise line clients across North America. These services include on-site parking management, valet parking, ground transportation services, facility maintenance, event logistics, baggage related services, remote airline check-in services, security services, municipal meter revenue collection and enforcement services, and consulting services. We market and offer many of our services under our SP+ and Bags® brands, which reflect our ability to provide customized solutions and meet the varied demands of our diverse client base. We can augment our parking services by providing our clients with related services through our SP+ Parking, SP+ Facility Maintenance, SP+ GAMEDAY, SP+ Transportation, SP+ Event Logistics, Bags® and, in certain sections of the United States and Canada, SP+ Security service lines, thus enabling our clients to efficiently address various needs through a single vendor relationship. We believe our ability to offer a comprehensive range of services on a national basis is a significant competitive advantage and allows our clients to attract, service and retain customers, gain access to the breadth and depth of our service and process expertise, leverage our significant technology capabilities and enhance their financial operations and customer experience. 


• | Our Scale and Diversification. Expanding our client base, industry vertical markets and geographic locations has enabled us to significantly enhance our operating efficiency over the past several years by standardizing processes and managing overhead. The ability to use our scale and purchasing power with vendors drives cost savings and benefits to our client base. 


◦ | Client Base. Our clients include some of North America's largest private and public owners, municipalities, managers and developers of major office buildings, residential properties, commercial properties, shopping centers and other retail properties, sports and special event complexes, hotels and resorts, healthcare facilities and medical centers, airports, airlines and cruise lines. 


◦ | Industry Vertical Markets. We believe that our industry vertical market diversification, such as commercial real estate, residential communities, hotels and resorts, airports, airlines, cruise lines, healthcare facilities and medical centers, seaports, municipalities and government facilities, commercial real estate, residential communities, retail operations, large event venues, and colleges and universities, allows us to minimize our exposure to industry-specific seasonality and volatility. We believe that the breadth of end-markets we serve and the depths and diversity of services we offer to those end-markets provide us with a broader base of clients that we can target. 


◦ | Geographic Locations. We have a diverse geographic footprint that includes operations in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and three Canadian provinces as of December 31, 2018. 


• | Stable Client Relationships. We have a track record of providing our clients with consistent, value-added and high quality services and customer experience. We continue to see a trend in outsourcing to professional service providers; we believe this trend has meaningful benefits to companies like ours, which has a national footprint and scale, extensive industry experience, broad process capabilities, and a demonstrated ability to create value for our clients. 


• | Established Platform for Future Growth. We have invested resources and developed a national infrastructure and technology platform that is complemented by significant management expertise, which enables us to scale our business for future growth effectively and efficiently. We have the ability to transition into local service operations very quickly, from the simplest to the most complex operation, and have experience working with incumbent professional service operators to implement smooth and efficient takeovers and integrate new local professional service operations seamlessly into our existing operations. 


• | Predictable Business Model. We believe that our business model provides us with a measure of insulation from broader economic cycles, because a significant portion of our locations operate on management type contracts, that for the most part, are not dependent upon the financial performance of the client's operation. 


• | Highly Capital Efficient Business with Attractive Cash Flow Characteristics. Our business generates attractive cash flow due to negative working capital dynamics and our low capital expenditure requirements. 


• | Focus on Operational Excellence and Human Capital Management. Our culture and training programs place a continuing focus on excellence in the execution of all aspects of day-to-day operations. This focus is reflected in our ability to deliver to our clients professional, high-quality services through well-trained, service-oriented personnel, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors. To support our focus on operational excellence, we manage our human capital through a comprehensive, structured program that evaluates the competencies and performance of all of our key operations and administrative support personnel on an annual basis. We have also dedicated significant resources to human capital management, providing comprehensive training for our employees, delivered primarily through the use of our web-based SP+ University™ learning management system, which promotes customer service and client retention in addition to providing our employees with continued training and career development opportunities. 

5

• | Focus on Operational Safety Initiatives. Our culture and training programs continue to focus on various safety initiatives and disciplines throughout the organization, as we implement an integrated approach for continuous improvement in our risk and safety programs. We have also dedicated significant resources to our risk and safety programs by providing comprehensive training for our employees, delivered primarily through the use of our web-based SP+ University™ learning management system, on-site training and our SP+irit in Safety newsletters. 

Our Growth Strategy
Building on these competitive strengths, we believe we are well positioned to execute on the following growth strategies:

• | Grow Our Business in Existing Geographic Markets. Our strategy is to capitalize on economies of scale and operating efficiencies by expanding our business in our existing geographic markets, especially in our core markets. As a given geographic market achieves a threshold operational size, we typically will establish a local office in order to promote increased operating efficiency by enabling local managers to use a common staff for recruiting, training and human resources support. This concentration of operating locations allows for increased operating efficiency and superior levels of customer service and retention through the accessibility of local managers and support resources. 


• | Increase Penetration in Our Current Industry Vertical Markets. We believe that a significant opportunity exists for us to further expand our presence into certain industry vertical markets, such as airports and aviation, colleges and universities, healthcare, municipalities, hospitality and event services. In order to effectively target these markets, we have implemented a go-to-market strategy of aligning our business by industry vertical markets and branding our domain expertise through our SP+ and Bags® designations to highlight the specialized expertise, competencies and services that we provide to meet the needs of each particular industry and customer. Our recognized SP+ brand, which emphasizes our specialized market expertise and distinguishes our ancillary service lines from traditional parking, includes a broad array of our operating divisions such as, SP+ Commercial Services, SP+ Airport Services, SP+ GAMEDAY, SP+ Healthcare Services, SP+ Hospitality Services, SP+ Municipal Services, SP+ Office Services, SP+ Residential Services, SP+ Retail Services, and SP+ University Services, which further highlight the market-specific subject matter expertise that enables our professionals to meet the varied demands of our clients. 


• | Expand and Cross-Sell Additional Services to Drive Incremental Revenue. We believe we have significant opportunities to further strengthen our relationships with existing clients, and to attract new clients, by continuing to cross-sell value-added services that complement our core service operations. 


• | Grow and Expand Cross-Selling Bags Services. Bags® is a leading provider of baggage services, remote airline check-in services, and other related services, primarily to airline, airport, sea ports, cruise lines and hotels and resorts. Bags combines exceptional customer service with innovative technologies to provide these value-add client and customer services. We believe the acquisition of Bags allows us further cross-sell the aforementioned services that Bags provides to our existing clients within the aviation, hospitality, commercial markets and for us to cross-sell parking services and ground transportation services and other ancillary services to our existing Bags® clients. Our emphasis on these innovative services will continue to drive value with our clients and allow us to expand our footprint into multiple markets. 


• | Expand Our Geographic Platform. We believe that opportunities exist to further develop new geographic markets through new contracts, acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures or partnerships. Clients who outsource the management of their operations and professional services often have a presence in a variety of urban markets and seek to outsource the management of their operations to a national provider. We continue to focus on leveraging relationships with existing clients that have locations in multiple markets as one potential entry point into developing new core markets. 


• | Focus on Operational Efficiencies to Further Improve Profitability. We have invested substantial resources in information technology and continually seek to consolidate various corporate functions where possible in order to improve our processes and service offerings. In addition, we will continue to evaluate and improve our human capital management to ensure a consistent and high-level of service for our clients. The initiatives undertaken to date in these areas have improved our cost structure and enhanced our financial strength, which we believe will continue to yield future benefits. SP+ Remote Management Services allows us to provide remote management services, whereby personnel are able to monitor revenue and other aspects of an operation and provide 24-hour-a-day customer assistance (including remedying equipment malfunctions at a facility) by using off-site personnel and equipment. We have begun expanding the facilities where our remote management technology is installed. We expect this business to grow as clients focus on improving the profitability of their operations by decreasing labor costs at their locations through remote management services. 


• | Pursue Opportunistic, Strategic Acquisitions. The outsourced professional services industry remains fragmented and presents a significant opportunity for us. Given the scale in our existing operating platform, we have a demonstrated ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions such as Bags. We will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and joint venture investment opportunities that help us acquire scale or further enhance our service capabilities. 

6

• | Grow and Expand the Hospitality Business. SP+ Hospitality Services is a leader in the valet industry, and management continues to believe there is significant opportunity to use SP+'s capabilities to further develop a national valet business. Our objective is to focus on the most important aspects of the valet business promptly upon obtaining a new location, from the first contact with a potential customer to the execution of our services. Given the importance of neat, clean and polite service, the success of our valet business is dependent upon ensuring that its valet associates deliver excellent service every day. To accomplish this objective, our SP+ University Services™ provides training to its valet associates. SP+ University Services™ continuously provides training to our valet professionals to become an integrated extension of our clients' staff and blend seamlessly into the overall hospitality experience. 

Business Development
Our efforts to attract new clients are primarily concentrated in and coordinated by a dedicated business development group, whose background and expertise is in the field of sales and marketing, and whose financial compensation is determined to a significant extent by their business development success. This business development group is responsible for forecasting sales, maintaining a pipeline of prospective and existing clients, initiating contacts with such clients, and then following through to coordinate meetings involving those clients and the appropriate members of our operations hierarchy. By concentrating our sales efforts through this dedicated group, we enable our operations personnel to focus on achieving excellence in our operations, and maximizing our clients' profits, enhancing customer experience, and increasing our own profitability.
We also place a specific focus on marketing and client relationship efforts that pertain to those clients having a large regional or national presence. Accordingly, we assign a dedicated executives to those clients to manage the overall client relationship, address any existing portfolio issues as well as to reinforce existing and develop new account relationships, and to take any other action that may further our business development interests.
Competition
We face competition from large national competitors and numerous smaller, locally owned independent professional service providers and operators, operating an array of service offerings and professional service solutions, which may include developers, hotels and resorts, airports, airlines, cruise lines, national services companies and other institutions that may elect to internally manage their own professional services. Additionally, technological factors that improve ride-sharing capabilities and increase the use of parking aggregators can impact our parking and parking management business. Some of our present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we have, which may negatively impact our ability to retain existing contracts and gain new contracts. We also face significant competition in our efforts to provide ancillary services such as shuttle bus services and on-street parking enforcement because of the number of large companies that specialize in these services. 
We believe that we compete for management contract type clients based on a variety of factors, including fees charged for services, ability to generate revenues and control expenses for clients, accurate and timely reporting of operational results, providing high quality customer service and customer experience, and the ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. Factors that affect our ability to compete for lease contract type locations include the ability to make financial commitments, long-term financial stability, and the ability to generate revenues and control expenses. Factors affecting our ability to compete for employees include wages, benefits and working conditions.
Support Operations
We maintain regional and city offices throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico in order to support approximately 23,500 employees. These offices serve as the centralized locations through which we provide the employees to staff our professional services as well as the on-site and support management staff to oversee those operations. Our administrative staff accountants are primarily based in those same offices and facilitate the efficient, accurate and timely production and delivery of client deliverables, such as monthly reporting, etc. Having these all-inclusive operations and accounting teams located in regional and city offices throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico allows us to add new professional services for new and existing clients in a seamless and cost-efficient manner.
Our overall basic corporate functions in the areas of finance, human resources, risk management, legal, purchasing and procurement, general administration, strategy and information and technology are based in our Chicago corporate office and the Nashville and Orlando support offices.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 23,500 individuals, including 14,200 full-time and 9,300 part-time employees, and as of December 31, 2017, we employed 20,800 individuals, including 13,100 full-time and 7,700 part-time employees. Approximately 27% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and represented by labor unions, which include various local operational employees. Various union locals represent local operational employees in the following cities: Akron (OH), Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Buffalo, Burbank, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Flint, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Manchester (NH), Meadowlands, Miami, New York City, Newark, Oakland, Ontario (Canada), Oxon Hill, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, Providence, Richmond, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Santa Ana, Santa Monica, Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Windsor Locks. 
7
We are frequently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with various union locals. No single collective bargaining agreement covers a material number of our employees. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
Insurance
We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur in the operations that we lease or manage including coverage for general/garage liability, garage keepers legal liability, and auto liability. In addition, we purchase workers' compensation insurance for all eligible employees and umbrella/excess liability coverage. Under our various liability and workers' compensation insurance policies, we are obligated to pay directly or reimburse the insurance carrier for the deductible / retention amount for each loss covered by our general/garage liability, our automobile liability, our workers' compensation, and our garage keepers legal liability policy. As a result, we are effectively self-insured for all claims up to the deductible / retention amount for each loss. We also purchase property insurance that provides coverage for loss or damage to our property and in some cases our clients' property, as well as business interruption coverage for lost operating income and certain associated expenses. Because of the size of the operations covered and our claims experience, we purchase insurance policies at prices that we believe represent a discount to the prices that would typically be charged to clients on a stand-alone basis. The clients for whom we provide professional services pursuant to management type contracts have the option of purchasing their own liability insurance policies (provided that we are named as an additional insured party), but historically most of our clients have chosen to obtain insurance coverage by being named as additional insureds under our master liability insurance policies. Pursuant to our management type contracts, we charge those clients an allocated portion of our insurance-related costs.
We provide group health insurance with respect to eligible full-time employees (whether they work at leased facilities, managed facilities or in our support offices). We self-insure the cost of the medical claims for these participants up to a stop-loss limit. Pursuant to our management type contracts, we charge those clients an allocated portion of our insurance-related costs.
Regulation
Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, and in some cases, municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities. Our facilities in New York City are, for example, subject to extensive governmental restrictions concerning automobile capacity, pricing, structural integrity and certain prohibited practices. Many cities impose a tax or surcharge on parking services, which generally range from 10% to 50% of revenues collected. We collect and remit sales/parking taxes and file tax returns for and on behalf of our clients and ourselves. We are affected by laws and regulations that may impose a direct assessment on us for failure to remit sales/parking taxes or to file tax returns for ourselves and on behalf of our clients.
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In connection with the operation of parking facilities, we may be potentially liable for any such costs.
Several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car-pooling and the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage. These types of laws have adversely affected our revenues and could continue to do so in the future. For example, the City of New York and Boston imposed restrictions in the wake of terrorist attacks, which included street closures, traffic flow restrictions and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour. It is possible that cities could enact new or additional measures such as higher tolls, increased taxes and vehicle occupancy requirements in certain circumstances, which could adversely impact us. We are also affected by zoning and use restrictions and other laws and regulations that are common to any business that deals with real estate.
In addition, we are subject to laws generally applicable to businesses, including but not limited to federal, state and local regulations relating to wage and hour matters, employee classification, mandatory healthcare benefits, unlawful workplace discrimination, human rights laws and whistle blowing. Several cities in which we have operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so-called "living wage" ordinances, which could adversely impact our profitability by requiring companies that contract with local governmental authorities and other employers to increase wages to levels substantially above the federal minimum wage. In addition, we are subject to provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended ("OSHA"), and related regulations. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with any regulation applicable to our business or any whistle-blowing claim, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation, regulatory action or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In connection with ground transportation services and certain airline and cruise line transportation, baggage services and remote airline check-in services provided to our clients, the U.S. Department of Transportation, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Department of Homeland Security, and various federal and state agencies, exercise broad powers over these certain transportation services, including shuttle bus operations, baggage delivery services, and remote airline check-in, licensing and authorizations, safety, training and insurance requirements. Our employees must also comply with the various safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other federal agencies, including those related to minimum training hours and requirements, drug and alcohol testing and service hours. We may become subject to new and more restrictive federal and state regulations. Compliance with such regulations may increase our operating costs. 
8
We are also subject to consumer credit laws and credit card industry rules and regulations relating to the processing of credit card transactions, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Payment Card Data Security Standard. These laws and these industry standards impose substantial financial penalties for non-compliance.
Various other governmental regulations affect our operation of parking facilities, both directly and indirectly, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"). Under the ADA, all public accommodations, including parking facilities, are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. For example, the ADA requires parking facilities to include handicapped spaces, headroom for wheelchair vans, attendants' booths that accommodate wheelchairs and elevators that are operable by disabled persons. When negotiating management type contracts and lease type contracts with clients, we generally require that the property owner contractually assume responsibility for any ADA liability in connection with the property. There can be no assurance, however, that the property owner has assumed such liability for any given property and there can be no assurance that we would not be held liable despite assumption of responsibility for such liability by the property owner. Management believes that the parking facilities we operate are in substantial compliance with ADA requirements.
Regulations by the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") may affect our business. The FAA generally prohibits parking within 300 feet of airport terminals during times of heightened alert. The 300 foot rule and new regulations may prevent us from using a number of existing spaces during heightened security alerts at airports. Reductions in the number of parking spaces may reduce our gross profit and cash flow for both our leased facilities and those facilities we operate under management type contracts.
