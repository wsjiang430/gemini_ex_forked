ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
The New York Times Company and, unless the context otherwise requires, its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us.”
We are a global media organization focused on creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information that helps our audience understand and engage with the world, and this mission has contributed to our success. We believe that The Times’s original, independent and high-quality reporting, storytelling and journalistic excellence set us apart from other news organizations and are at the heart of what makes our journalism worth paying for. The quality of our coverage has been widely recognized with many industry and peer accolades, including more Pulitzer Prizes and citations than any other news organization.
The Company includes our digital and print products and related businesses, including:
•our core news product, The New York Times (“The Times”), which is available on our mobile applications, on our website (NYTimes.com) and as a printed newspaper, and associated content such as our podcasts;
•our other interest-specific products, including The Athletic (our sports media product acquired on February 1, 2022), Cooking (our recipes product), Games (our puzzle games product) and Audm (our read-aloud audio service), which are available on mobile applications and websites and Wirecutter (our review and recommendation product); and
•our related businesses, such as our licensing operations; our commercial printing operations; our live events business; and other products and services under The Times brand.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.55 million subscribers had purchased approximately 10.98 million paid subscriptions across our products, more than at any point in our history. 
We generate revenues principally from the sale of subscriptions and advertising. Subscription revenues consist of revenues from standalone and multi-product bundle subscriptions to our digital products and subscriptions to and single-copy and bulk sales of our print products. Advertising revenue is derived from the sale of our advertising products and services. Revenue information for the Company appears under “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
The Company was incorporated on August 26, 1896, under the laws of the State of New York.

OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to be the essential digital subscription for every curious, English-speaking person seeking to understand and engage with the world, which includes:
•being the world’s best general interest news destination;
•becoming more valuable to more people by helping them make the most of their lives and engage with their passions; and
•creating a more expansive and connected product experience that makes our products indispensable. 
Our latest audience research suggests that there are at least 135 million adults worldwide who are willing to pay for one or more subscriptions to English-language news, sports coverage, puzzles, recipes, expert shopping advice or audio journalism. Our current aim is to reach 15 million total subscribers by year-end 2027, up from approximately 9.55 million at the end of 2022. We believe that focusing on the following priorities will enable us to become an essential subscription for our addressable market and drive long-term, profitable growth for the Company and our stockholders.
Producing the best journalism
We believe that our original, independent and high-quality reporting, storytelling and journalistic excellence across topics and formats set us apart from others and are at the heart of what makes our journalism worth paying for. The impact of our journalism and its breadth were evident as we continued to break stories, produce investigative reports and help our audience understand a wide range of topics in 2022, including the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its many reverberations, Russia’s war against Ukraine and the U.S. midterm elections. Producing the best journalism also makes us a more attractive destination for the talented individuals who are vital to the continued success of our business.
We will seek to extend our leadership in news by continuing to focus on four major areas — providing expert beat reporting on a broad array of important subjects, covering breaking news, producing signature journalism projects and excelling at ideas-based commentary and criticism.
While general-interest news is and will remain our primary value proposition, we are building leadership positions in a handful of areas that occupy a prominent place in global culture alongside general-interest news — including sports, cooking guidance, puzzle gaming and expert shopping recommendations. Our 2022 acquisitions of The Athletic and Wordle (a daily digital word game) were two investments toward expanding our offerings to build that leadership.
In 2023, we plan to continue investing in our journalism and remain committed to providing a multimedia report of deep breadth, authority, creativity and excellence, produced with a focus on independence and integrity.
Growing audience and engagement with our products
Our ability to attract, retain and grow our digital subscriber base depends on the size of our audience and its sustained engagement directly with our products. We will continue to focus on reaching a large non-paying audience while also creating a subscription experience aimed at building valuable daily habits that draw people into lifelong relationships worth paying for. Central to our strategy is a high-value subscription package — or bundle — of interconnected digital products that helps subscribers engage with everything we offer and provides multiple reasons to engage with our products each day.
Across all of our products, we have invested in bringing readers back to our content, exposing them to more of our offerings and providing an integrated product experience. Within news, for example, our live briefings keep users up to date on the latest developments across important storylines. Our suite of email newsletters reaches the inboxes of millions of global users and plays a central role in engaging potential subscribers. Our news mobile applications help surface and provide users with a seamless way to experience a variety of our games, including our word puzzles (Wordle, Spelling Bee and the Crossword) and other games.
We plan to continue to invest in engaging content and product features across our news, Cooking, Games and Wirecutter products; to help The Athletic reach more sports fans; and to develop new audio programming and experiment in audio product. We see all of these products and investments as increasing the value of our bundle and contributing to our essential subscription strategy. 
P. 2 – THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY


Growing subscribers, revenue and profit
We believe we are still in the early days of penetrating a large and growing global subscription journalism market and our ambition is to be the leader in that market. In this context, we view a large and growing subscriber base as our best lever for long-term value creation because it generates recurring consumer revenue; has the potential to generate more advertising, commerce and other future revenue opportunities; and contributes to higher marketing efficiency.
We plan to continue our emphasis on growing total subscribers through our focus on promoting our digital bundle of interconnected products, which we believe provides the most value to our users and represents the best opportunity to monetize our digital products. While we aim to expose more of our subscribers to everything that we offer through the bundle, we continue to offer subscriptions to each of our products on a standalone basis as well to attract the widest number of subscribers. 
High-value digital advertising revenue remains an important part of our business. We believe our journalism attracts valuable audiences and that we provide a trusted platform for advertisers’ brands. We continue to innovate advertising offerings that integrate well with the user experience, including solutions that use proprietary first-party data to help inform our clients’ advertising strategies. 
We believe we can apply disciplined cost-management while continuing to invest in journalism and product development in support of long-term profitable growth. Given that our investments in our journalism and digital product experience have yielded strong organic subscriber growth, we expect that we’ll be able to maintain the improved efficiency of our marketing spend for our core products that we demonstrated in the second half of 2022. We also aim to continue to maximize the efficiency and profitability of our print products and services, which remain a significant part of our business.
Using technology and data to propel our growth 
Achieving our ambition will require products and technology that match the quality of our journalism. Over the past several years, we have invested substantially in the back-end technology and underlying capabilities that enrich the digital experience for users and empower our journalists and business operators. In 2023, we plan to continue prioritizing these areas, with a focus on strengthening our data management infrastructure, enhancing the platforms that power our multi-product digital bundle, and advancing machine-learning applications across our business. We have already seen and expect to see further benefits from these investments as they help us better engage, habituate, convert and retain more subscribers.

PRODUCTS
The Company’s principal business consists of distributing content through our digital and print platforms. In addition, we distribute selected content on third-party platforms. 
We offer a digital bundle subscription package that includes access to our digital news product (which includes our news website, NYTimes.com, and mobile applications), The Athletic, and our Cooking, Games and Wirecutter products, as well as standalone digital subscriptions to each of those products and to Audm. Digital subscriptions can be purchased by individual consumers or as part of group education or group corporate subscriptions.
Our access model for our news, Cooking, Games and Wirecutter products and The Athletic generally offers users who have registered free access to a limited number of articles or pieces of content before requiring users to subscribe for access to additional content. We make the choice at times to suspend limits on registered users’ free access to particularly important news coverage. We also make some of our content free as a way to generate large audiences that we monetize through advertising or by eventually converting them into subscribers; this includes Wordle (a daily digital word game) and our podcasts (which are distributed both on our digital platforms and on third-party platforms).
The Times’s print newspaper, which commenced publication in 1851, is published seven days a week in the United States. The Times also has an international edition of our print newspaper that is tailored for global audiences and is the successor to the International Herald Tribune, which commenced publication in Paris in 1887. Our print newspapers are sold in the United States and around the world through individual home-delivery subscriptions, bulk subscriptions (primarily by schools and hotels) and single-copy sales. Print home-delivery subscribers are entitled to receive free access to our digital news product, The Athletic, and our Cooking, Games and Wirecutter products.
SUBSCRIBERS, SUBSCRIPTIONS AND AUDIENCE
Our content reaches a broad audience through both digital and print platforms. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 9.55 million subscribers across 235 countries and territories had purchased approximately 10.98 million paid subscriptions to our digital and print products. 
Paid digital-only subscribers totaled approximately 8.83 million as of December 31, 2022. This includes subscribers with paid digital-only subscriptions to one or more of our news product, The Athletic, or our Cooking, Games and Wirecutter products. The international portion of subscribers with a paid digital-only subscription that includes the ability to access the Company’s digital news product represented approximately 19% as of December 31, 2022.
The number of paid digital-only subscribers also includes estimated group corporate and group education subscriptions (which collectively represented approximately 5% of total paid digital subscribers as of December 31, 2022). The numbers of paid group subscribers and subscriptions are derived using the value of the relevant contract and a discounted subscription rate. The actual number of users who have access to our products through group sales is substantially higher.
According to comScore Media Metrix, an online audience-measurement service, in 2022, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 99 million unique visitors in the United States on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices. Globally, including the United States, NYTimes.com had a monthly average of approximately 145 million unique visitors on either desktop/laptop computers or mobile devices, according to internal data estimates.
In the United States, The Times had the largest daily and Sunday print circulation of all seven-day newspapers for the six-month period ended September 25, 2022, according to data collected by the Alliance for Audited Media (“AAM”), an independent agency that audits circulation of most U.S. newspapers and magazines.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, The Times’s average circulation (which includes paid and qualified circulation of the newspaper in print) was approximately 310,000 for weekday (Monday to Friday) and 745,000 for Sunday. (Under AAM’s reporting guidance, qualified circulation represents copies available for individual consumers that are either non-paid or paid by someone other than the individual, such as copies delivered to schools and colleges and copies purchased by businesses for free distribution.)

ADVERTISING 
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of advertising products and services principally to advertisers (such as technology, luxury goods and financial companies) promoting products, services or brands on digital platforms in the form of display ads, audio and video, and in print, in the form of column-inch ads.
The majority of our advertising revenue is derived from offerings sold directly to marketers by our advertising sales teams. A smaller proportion of our total advertising revenues is generated through programmatic auctions run by third-party advertising exchanges. 
Digital advertising includes our core digital advertising business and other digital advertising. Our core digital advertising includes direct-sold website, mobile application, podcast, email and video advertisements. Our digital advertising offerings include solutions that use proprietary first-party data to generate predictive insights and help inform our clients’ advertising strategies while leveraging our audiences in privacy-forward ways. Other digital advertising includes advertising revenues generated by open-market programmatic advertising, creative services associated with branded content, advertisements appearing on our Wirecutter product and classified advertising. In 2022, digital advertising represented approximately 61% of our advertising revenues.
At the time of its acquisition, The Athletic had a limited advertising business, consisting primarily of podcast advertising. We are developing a broader set of advertising products and services for the site over time.
Print advertising for The Times includes revenue from column-inch ads and classified advertising, including line-ads as well as preprinted advertising, also known as freestanding inserts. Column-inch ads are priced according to established rates, with premiums for color and positioning, and classified advertising is paid for on a per-line basis. The Times newspaper had the largest market share in 2022 in print advertising among a national newspaper set that consists of USA Today, The Wall Street Journal and The Times, according to MediaRadar, an independent agency that measures advertising sales volume. In 2022, print advertising represented approximately 39% of our advertising revenues.
Our business is affected in part by seasonal patterns in advertising, with generally higher advertising volume in the fourth quarter due to holiday advertising.
COMPETITION
We operate in a highly competitive environment that is subject to rapid change and face significant competition in all aspects of our business. We compete for audience, subscribers and advertising against a wide variety of digital and print media companies, including digital and traditional print content providers, news aggregators, search engines, social media platforms and streaming services, any of which might attract audiences and/or advertisers to their platforms and away from ours. Our news product most directly competes for audience, subscriptions and advertising with other U.S. and global news and information digital and print products, including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, BBC News, Vox, The Guardian and Financial Times. Our digital news product also competes with customized news feeds, news aggregators and social media products of companies such as Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Twitter. Our other digital products compete with comparable content providers, as well as other digital media of general interest. In addition, we compete for advertising on digital advertising networks and exchanges with real-time bidding and other programmatic buying channels.
Competition for subscription revenue and audience is generally based upon content breadth, depth, originality, quality and timeliness; product experience; format; our products’ pricing and subscription plans and access models; visibility on search engines and social media platforms and in mobile application stores; and service. Competition for advertising revenue is generally based upon the content and format of our products, audience levels and demographics, advertising rates, service, targeting capabilities, results observed by advertisers and perceived effectiveness of advertising offerings. We believe that our original, independent and high-quality reporting, storytelling and journalistic excellence across topics and formats set us apart from others and is at the heart of what makes our journalism worth paying for, and we believe our journalism attracts valuable audiences and provides a safe and trusted platform for advertisers’ brands.

OTHER BUSINESSES
We also derive revenue from other businesses, which primarily include:
•The Company’s licensing of our intellectual property. We license content to digital aggregators in the business, professional, academic and library markets in addition to licensing select content to third-party digital platforms for access by their users. As part of our news and syndication services, we license articles, graphics and photographs to over 1,500 clients, including newspapers, magazines and websites in over 85 countries and territories worldwide. We also license content for use in television, films and books; provide rights to reprint articles; and create and sell news digests based on our content;
•Our Wirecutter product, which generates affiliate referral revenue (revenue generated by offering direct links to merchants in exchange for a portion of the sale price upon completion of a transaction) in addition to advertising and subscription revenue; 
•The Company’s commercial printing operations, which utilize excess capacity at our facility in College Point, N.Y., to print and distribute products for third parties; and
•The Company’s live events business, which hosts events to connect audiences with our journalists and outside thought leaders, and is monetized through sponsorship and advertising. 
PRINT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
The Times is currently printed at our production and distribution facility in College Point, N.Y., as well as under contract at 24 remote print sites across the United States. We also utilize excess capacity at our College Point facility for commercial printing and distribution for third parties. The Times is delivered in the New York metropolitan area through a combination of our own drivers and agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents. In other markets in the United States and Canada, The Times is delivered through agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents.
The international edition of The Times is printed under contract at 28 sites throughout the world and is sold in approximately 80 countries and territories. It is distributed through agreements with other newspapers and third-party delivery agents.
RAW MATERIALS
The primary raw materials we use are newsprint and coated paper, which we purchase from a number of North American and European producers. A significant portion of our newsprint is purchased from Resolute FP US Inc., a subsidiary of Resolute Forest Products Inc., a large global manufacturer of paper, market pulp and wood products.
In 2022 and 2021, we used the following types and quantities of paper:

(In metric tons) | 2022 | 2021
Newsprint(1) | 65,000 | | 63,600

HUMAN CAPITAL
By acting in accordance with our mission and our values – independence, integrity, curiosity, respect, collaboration and excellence – we serve our readers and society, ensure the continued strength of our journalism and business, and foster a healthy and vibrant Times culture.
The employees who make up our workplace are vital to the continued success of our mission and business and central to our long-term strategy. In order to attract, develop, retain and maximize the contributions of world-class talent, we work to create an engaging and rewarding employee experience in a variety of ways, including building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace; developing and promoting talent; providing equitable and competitive compensation and benefits (total rewards); and supporting employees’ health, safety and well-being.
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5,800 full-time equivalent employees, which includes more than 2,600 involved in our journalism operation. While we have employees located throughout the world, our employees are primarily located in the United States.
Building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace
Each year, we prepare an in-depth report on diversity and inclusion to promote accountability over time. 
Steps to advance our diversity, equity and inclusion goals include:
•Investing in dedicated resources. We have a dedicated team to lead and support our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
•Promoting an equitable and respectful workplace culture. This includes a rigorous and transparent process for investigating workplace complaints and concerns, as well as expectations for our employees on how to approach their work and engage with, manage and lead each other. 
•Focusing on pay equity. Every two years, including in 2021, we conduct a pay-equity study, an in-depth review of our compensation practices conducted with an outside expert to identify, assess and rectify any inconsistencies in pay. We analyze average differences across race and gender of people performing similar work, taking into account factors that explain legitimate differences in pay, such as tenure and performance, and also perform a thorough analysis of individual pay. 
•Investing in diversifying the employee pipeline. We seek to continuously improve our talent attraction programs and practices, including by building diverse candidate pools and pipelines, using inclusive and accessible job descriptions and promoting equitable recruitment and hiring practices. We invest in programs like The New York Times Fellowship Program (a one-year work program for up-and-coming journalists), The New York Times Corps (a talent-pipeline and career-mentorship program for college students) and the Editing Residency Program (a two-year training program for editors) and support many outside organizations dedicated to increasing diversity in journalism, technology and media. 
•Evolving opportunities for identity-based connection. We currently have 13 active employee resource groups, which help create a more inclusive environment for all employees; allow space to connect on shared experiences; serve as another channel for communication with leadership; and provide mentoring, career development and volunteering opportunities.
Our annual diversity reports, and more information on our approach to diversity, can be found at www.nytco.com/company/diversity-and-inclusion. The contents of our diversity reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.
Developing talent
We recognize the importance of creating opportunities for employees to develop and succeed at every level.
Identifying and putting in place effective executive leadership is critically important to our success. Our Board of Directors works with senior management to ensure that plans are in place for both short- and long-term executive succession. The Board conducts an annual detailed review of the Company’s leadership pipeline and succession plans for key senior leadership roles. 
We value ongoing development and continuous learning throughout the organization. We strive to support and provide enriching opportunities to our employees, including through a range of training, talks, professional

development resources, and programs such as our employee mentorship program. We also continue to work to further elevate how we lead, manage and promote people, including bolstering feedback, support and performance enablement systems. 
Providing equitable and competitive total rewards
We offer comprehensive total rewards, which are designed to meet the needs of our current and future employees; support the Company’s strategic goals, mission and values; drive a high-performance culture; and offer competitive and equitable pay. In line with our business goals, our total rewards philosophy links compensation to performance. Along with the compensation and benefits we provide, our reputation, workplace culture, and focus on equity and inclusion are all factors that help us attract and retain highly skilled people of diverse backgrounds.
Supporting employees’ health, safety and well-being
Our employees’ well-being is vital to our success, and their physical, mental and financial health are a top priority. We have invested in a variety of programs based on region that help support their day-to-day wellness needs and goals, including, but not limited to, health benefits, access to licensed professional counselors, health coaching and advocacy services, fitness resources, child and elder care help, financial wellness programs and more.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, we transitioned to having the vast majority of our employees work remotely. We more recently transitioned to a hybrid work environment, with many of our employees expected to work both from the office and remotely. To prepare for hybrid work, we invested in our offices as well as in technological tools, and we continue to focus on building workplace experience capabilities to support a variety of work styles where individuals, teams and our business can be successful. We have also continued to evolve our remote and distributed work policies and practices and to adapt to evolving workplace and workforce dynamics. 
Labor Relations
