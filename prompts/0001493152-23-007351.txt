ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company driven by immunology in the pursuit of prevention and treatment of disease. Through our innovative approach to virus-like particles (“VLPs”), including a proprietary enveloped VLP (“eVLP”) platform technology, we develop vaccine candidates that mimic the natural presentation of viruses, designed to elicit the innate power of the human immune system. We are committed to targeting and overcoming significant infectious diseases, including hepatitis B (“HBV”), COVID-19 and coronaviruses, and cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), as well as aggressive cancers including glioblastoma (“GBM”). We are headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with research operations in Ottawa, Canada, and a research and manufacturing site in Rehovot, Israel.
Product Pipeline
 
Our pipeline is comprised of vaccine and immunotherapeutic programs developed by virus-like particle technologies to target two distinct, but often related, disease areas - infectious disease and oncology. We prioritize the development of programs for disease targets that are challenging, underserved, and where the human immune system, when powered and stimulated appropriately, can be a formidable opponent.
 
VLP vaccines are a type of sub-unit vaccine, in which only the portions of viruses critical for eliciting an immune response are presented to the body. Because of their structural similarity to viruses presented in nature, including their particulate nature and repetitive structure, VLPs can stimulate potent immune responses. VLPs can be customized to present any protein antigen, including multiple antibody and T cell targets, making them, we believe, ideal technologies for the development of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. However, only a few antigenic proteins self-assemble into VLPs, which limit the number of potential targets. Notably, HBV antigens are among those that are able to spontaneously form orderly VLP structures. Our eVLP platform technology expands the list of potentially viable target indications for VLPs by providing a stable core (Gag Protein) and lipid bilayer (the “envelope”). It is a flexible platform that enables the synthetic manufacture of an “enveloped” VLP, or “eVLP”, which looks structurally and morphologically similar to the virus, with no infectious material.
 
Our product pipeline includes an approved vaccine and multiple late- and early-stage investigational programs. The investigational programs are in various stages of clinical development and the scientific information included about these therapeutics is preliminary and investigative. The investigational programs have not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), Health Canada, or any other health authority and no conclusion can or should be drawn regarding the safety or efficacy of these investigational programs.
 
In addition to our existing pipeline programs, we may also seek to in-license clinical-stage vaccines or vaccine-related technologies that we believe complement our pipeline, as well as technologies that may supplement our efforts in both immuno-oncology and infectious disease.
 
Key Targeted Disease Areas
 
Hepatitis B Virus (“HBV”)
 
HBV infection can cause liver inflammation, fibrosis, and liver injury, resulting in potentially life-threatening conditions through acute illness and chronic disease, including liver failure, cirrhosis, and cancer. HBV remains a significant public health burden with as many as 2.2 million chronically infected people in the U.S. alone. Worldwide, this number is estimated to be as high as 350 million, with approximately 800,000 deaths resulting from the consequences of HBV infection each year.
 
Despite the highly infectious nature of HBV, due to its often-asymptomatic nature, it is estimated that as many as 67% of chronically infected adults in the U.S. are unaware of their infection status. There is no cure available for HBV infection and while public health initiatives highlight immunization as the most effective strategy for the prevention of HBV infections, the U.S. adult HBV vaccination rates remain persistently low at only about 30% of all adults aged 19 years and older.

In April 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) implemented a change to the adult HBV vaccine recommendations. As incorporated in the CDC’s 2022 Adult Immunization Schedule and as published in the April 1, 2022, CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, adults aged 19 to 59 years are now universally recommended to be vaccinated against HBV infection. Additionally, while adults aged 60 years and older with risk factors for HBV infection are still recommended to receive HBV vaccinations, adults aged 60 years and older without known risk factors for HBV may now also receive HBV vaccinations.
 
In addition to our approved vaccine, PreHevbrio [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)], there are four other vaccines approved in the U.S. for the prevention of HBV infection in adults: Engerix-B® and Twinrix®, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. (“GSK”), Recombivax HB®, manufactured by Merck &. Co. (“Merck”), and Heplisav-B®, manufactured by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (“Dynavax”).
 
COVID-19 and Other Coronaviruses
 
Coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped viruses that cause respiratory illness of varying severities. Only seven coronaviruses are known to cause disease in humans, four of which most frequently cause symptoms typically associated with the common cold. Three of the seven coronaviruses, however, have more serious outcomes in people. These more pathogenic coronaviruses are (1) SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus identified as the cause of COVID-19; (2) MERS-CoV, identified in 2012 as the cause of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (“MERS”); and (3) SARS-CoV, identified in 2002 as the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”).
 
The virus that causes COVID-19 continues to evolve and several SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged and certain of these variants have been identified as having a significant public health impact. To date, notable Variants of Concern (“VOC”) have included:
 

● | Alpha (B.1.1.7) – First identified as in the United Kingdom (“UK”), VOC in December 2020 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Beta (B.1.351) – First identified in South Africa, VOC in December 2020 
● | Gamma (P.1) – First identified in Brazil, VOC in January 2021 
● | Delta (B.1.617.2) – First identified in India, VOC in May 2021 
● | Omicron and subvariants – First identified in South Africa, VOC in November 2021 

 
Glioblastoma (“GBM”)
 
GBM is among the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumors in humans. In the U.S. alone, about 12,000 new GBM cases are diagnosed each year. The current standard of care for GBM is surgical resection, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Even with intensive treatment, GBM progresses rapidly and has a high mortality rate, with median overall survival for primary GBM of about 14 months. Median overall survival for recurrent GBM is even lower, at about 8 months.
 
Cytomegalovirus (“CMV”)
 
CMV is a common virus that is a member of the herpes family. It infects one in every two people in many developed countries. Most CMV infections are “silent”, meaning the majority of people who are infected exhibit no signs or symptoms. Despite its typically asymptomatic nature in older children and adults, CMV may cause severe infections in newborn children (congenital CMV) and may also cause serious infections in people with weakened immune systems, such as solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Congenital CMV infection can be treated – but not cured – and there are currently no approved vaccines available for the prevention of infection in either the congenital or the transplant setting.

Zika
 
Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that is spread primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito, but can also be transmitted sexually, during pregnancy, or during childbirth. Acute infections are typically mild, but Zika has been associated with a number of neurological complications in newborns. The first formal description of Zika virus was published in 1952, but it was not until 2007 that the first Zika outbreak in humans was recorded. Over the past decade, Zika has begun to spread globally, and between January 2014 and February 2016, 33 countries reported circulation of the Zika virus, including in North America. There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika infection.

Marketed Product
 
PreHevbrio [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)]
 
PreHevbrio [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] was approved by the FDA on November 30, 2021, for the prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of HBV in adults aged 18 years and older. PreHevbrio contains the S, pre-S2, and pre-S1 HBV surface antigens, and is the only approved 3-antigen HBV vaccine for adults in the U.S. On February 23, 2022, following discussion at the CDC’s ACIP meeting, PreHevbrio joined the list of recommended products for prophylactic adult vaccination against HBV infection. The inclusion of PreHevbrio in the ACIP recommendation was reflected in a CDC publication on April 1, 2022 and was a notable milestone as many insurance plans and institutions require an ACIP recommendation before a vaccine can be reimbursed or is made available to patients. Additionally, PreHevbrio was included in the 2023 annual update of the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule, as detailed in the CDC publication on February 10, 2023. VBI launched PreHevbrio in the U.S. at the end of the first quarter of 2022, and revenue generation began in the second quarter of 2022.
 
Commercial and regulatory activity for VBI’s 3-antigen HBV vaccine outside of the U.S. include:
 

● | EU: On May 2, 2022, we announced that the European Commission (the “EC”) granted Marketing Authorization for PreHevbri [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant, Adsorbed)]. The European Commission’s centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU Member States as well as in the EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). On September 8, 2022, we announced a partnership with Valneva SE (“Valneva”) for the marketing and distribution of PreHevbri in select European markets, initially including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. As part of this partnership, VBI expects PreHevbri will be available in certain European countries beginning in the first half of 2023.

● | UK: On June 1, 2022, we announced that the MHRA granted marketing authorization for PreHevbri [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant, Adsorbed)]. This follows the EC centralized marketing authorization received in May 2022 and was conducted as part of the EC Decision Reliance Procedures (“ECDRP”). VBI expects to make PreHevbri available in the UK in the first half of 2023 as part of the partnership with Valneva. 
● | Canada: On December 8, 2022, we announced that Health Canada approved PreHevbrio [3-antigen Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] for the prevention of infection caused by all known subtypes of HBV in adults aged 18 years and older. VBI expects to make PreHevbrio available in Canada in 2023. 
● | Israel: Approved and commercially available under the brand name Sci-B-Vac®. 

Prophylactic Investigational Candidates
 
VBI-2900: Coronavirus Vaccine Program (VBI-2901, VBI-2902, VBI-2905)
 
In response to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, VBI initiated development of a prophylactic coronavirus vaccine program. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses by nature which make them a prime target for VBI’s flexible eVLP platform technology.
 
On August 26, 2020, we announced data from three pre-clinical studies conducted to enable selection of optimized clinical candidates for our coronavirus vaccine program. As a result of these studies, VBI selected two vaccine candidates with the goal of bringing forward candidates that add meaningful clinical and medical benefit to those already approved: (1) VBI-2901, a multivalent coronavirus vaccine candidate expressing the SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS spike proteins; and (2) VBI-2902, a monovalent vaccine candidate expressing an optimized “prefusion” form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
 
In March 2021, a Phase I study of VBI-2902 was initiated and on June 29, 2021, we announced initial positive data from the Phase Ia portion of this study that evaluated one- and two-dose regimens of 5µg of VBI-2902 in 61 healthy adults aged 18-54 years. After two doses, VBI-2902 induced neutralization titers in 100% of participants, with 4.3x higher geometric mean titer (“GMT”) than that of the convalescent serum panel (n=25), and peak antibody binding GMT of 1:4,047. VBI-2902 was also well tolerated with no safety signals observed.

In response to the increased circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the Phase Ib portion of the Phase I study was initiated in September 2021 to assess VBI-2905, our eVLP vaccine candidate directed against the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. On April 5, 2022, we announced new data from the Phase Ib study (n=53). A single-dose booster of VBI-2905 increased the geometric mean titer (“GMT”) of neutralizing antibodies directed against the Beta variant 3.8-fold, at day 28, in participants who had previously received two-doses of an mRNA vaccine (ancestral strain) – approximately 2-fold increases were also seen at day 28 in antibody GMTs against both the ancestral and delta variant. New preclinical data announced at the same time showed that against a panel of coronavirus variants in mice, reactivity was seen with VBI-2902 against all variants including the ancestral strain, Delta, Beta, Omicron, Lambda, and RaTG13 (a bat coronavirus that is distant to circulating human strains). In this same panel, VBI-2901 was able to elicit an even stronger response against all variants tested – as the strains became more divergent from the ancestral strain, VBI-2901 elicited a greater difference in GMT from VBI-2902, ranging from 2.5-fold higher against the ancestral strain to 9.0-fold higher against the bat coronavirus. Additionally, a validated pseudoparticle neutralization assay (“PNA”) benchmarked against the WHO reference standard demonstrated that VBI-2902 elicited neutralizing antibody responses of 176 IU50/mL in its Phase Ia study – this international standard measure would predict a greater than 90% efficacy, with two internationally approved vaccines estimated to have 90% efficacy at 83 and 140 IU50/mL (Gilbert, PB, 2021).
 
The clinical and preclinical data for all three candidates continue to support the potential of the eVLP platform against coronaviruses. On September 29, 2022, we announced that we initiated the first clinical study of VBI’s multivalent coronavirus candidate, VBI-2901, designed to increase breadth of protection against COVID-19 and related coronaviruses. Interim data from this study are expected mid-year 2023.
 
The VBI-2900 program is supported by a partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (“CEPI” and the partnership, the “CEPI Funding Agreement”), with contributions of up to $33 million; a partnership with the Strategic Innovation Fund (“SIF”), established by the Government of Canada, with an award of up to CAD $56 million; contribution of up to CAD $1 million from the Industrial Research Assistance Program (“IRAP”) of the National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”); and a collaboration with the NRC. On December 6, 2022, we and CEPI announced that we expanded the scope of the CEPI Funding Agreement to advance the development of multivalent coronavirus vaccines that could be deployed against COVID-19 as well as a future “Coronavirus X”.
 
VBI-1501: Prophylactic CMV Vaccine Candidate
 
Our prophylactic CMV vaccine candidate uses the eVLP platform to express a modified form of the CMV glycoprotein B (“gB”) antigen and is adjuvanted with alum, an adjuvant used in FDA-approved products.
 
Following the successful completion of the Phase I study in May 2018, and positive discussions with Health Canada, we announced plans for a Phase II clinical study evaluating VBI-1501 on December 20, 2018. We received similarly positive guidance from the FDA in July 2019. The Phase II study is expected to assess the safety and immunogenicity of dosages of VBI-1501 up to 20µg with alum. We are currently evaluating the timing of the Phase II study.
 
Therapeutic Investigational Candidates
 
VBI-2601: HBV Immunotherapeutic Candidate
 
VBI-2601 (BRII-179) is our novel, recombinant, protein-based immunotherapeutic candidate in development for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. VBI-2601 is formulated to induce broad immunity against HBV, including T-cell immunity which plays an important role in controlling HBV infection.
 
On April 12, 2021, and June 23, 2021, we announced data from the completed Phase Ib/IIa clinical study in patients with chronic HBV infection, which was conducted by our partner Brii Biosciences Limited (“Brii Bio”). The study was a randomized, controlled study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, antiviral and immunologic activity of VBI-2601. The study was a two-part, dose-escalation study assessing different dose levels of VBI-2601 with and without an immunomodulatory adjuvant, conducted at multiple study sites in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and China.

The data from the Phase Ib/IIa for 33 evaluable patients across all study arms suggested: (1) VBI-2601 was well tolerated at all dose levels with and without the adjuvant with no significant adverse events identified; (2) VBI-2601 induced both B cell (antibody) and T cell responses in chronically-infected HBV patients, (3) VBI-2601 induced restimulation of T cell responses to HBV surface antigens, including S, Pre-S1, and Pre-S2, in greater than 50% of the evaluable patients compared to no detectable response in the control arm; (4) the T cell responses and antibody responses were comparable across the 20µg and 40µg unadjuvanted study arms; and (5) T cell response rates between the adjuvanted and unadjuvanted cohorts were also comparable. Based on the acceptable safety profile and vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses seen in this study, VBI-2601 (BRII-179) advanced to Phase II studies.
 
On April 21, 2021, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase II clinical study evaluating VBI-2601 in combination with BRII-835 (VIR-2218), an investigational small interfering ribonucleic acid (“siRNA”) targeting HBV, for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The multi-center, randomized, open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination with and without interferon-alpha as a co-adjuvant. The study is being conducted at clinical sites in Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and Thailand. VBI’s partner, Brii Bio, is the study sponsor. A total of 50 adult, non-cirrhotic patients who received NRTI therapy for at least 12 months were randomized and dosed across three cohorts:
 

● | Cohort A: BRII-835 Alone Regimen – Nine subcutaneous 100mg doses of BRII-835, dosed every four (4) weeks through Week 32 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cohort B: BRII-835 Alone Regimen + nine 40µg intramuscular doses of VBI-2601 admixed with interferon-alpha (IFN-α) as co-adjuvant every four weeks from Week 8 through Week 40 
● | Cohort C: BRII-835 Alone Regimen + nine 40µg intramuscular doses of VBI-2601 without IFN-α every four weeks from Week 8 through Week 40 



On February 15, 2023, we announced interim data from the Phase II combination study. The data, which was featured in an oral presentation at the 32nd Conference of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (“APASL”) on February 18, 2023, demonstrated that the combination therapy was generally well-tolerated, restored strong anti-HBsAg antibody responses, and led to improved HBsAg-specific T-cell responses, when compared to BRII-835 alone. Notably:
 

● | Mean changes in HBsAg reduction relative to baseline at week 40 were -1.68 log10 IU/mL in Cohort A, -1.75 log10 IU/mL in Cohort B, and -1.77 log10 IU/mL in Cohort C 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Potent HBV surface antibody levels (> 100 IU/L) were observed in more than 40% of participants in Cohorts B and C at week 40 – by comparison, no antibody responses were detected in Cohort A 
● | Out of 25 evaluable patients, a higher proportion of Cohort B and C patients demonstrated potent HBsAg-specific T-cell responses (70%; 14/20) relative to those in Cohort A (20%; 1/5) through week 44 
● | To date, two participants receiving combination regimens achieved either HBsAg below LLOQ (0.05 mIU/mL), to an undetectable level, or at LLOQ with maximum reductions of ≥ 4 log10 HBsAg – both participants mounted potent anti-HBs antibody and HBV-specific T-cell responses

Additional data from the study are expected to be announced later this year.
 
On January 5, 2022, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a second Phase IIa/IIb clinical study evaluating VBI-2601. This Phase II study assesses VBI-2601 as an add-on therapy to the standard-of-care in China nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) and pegylated interferon therapy (PEG-IFN-α,). Interim topline clinical data from part one of this Phase IIa/IIb clinical study is expected in the third quarter of 2023.


VBI-1901: Glioblastoma (GBM)
 
Our cancer vaccine immunotherapeutic program, VBI-1901, targets CMV proteins present in tumor cells. CMV is associated with a number of solid tumors including GBM, breast cancer, and pediatric medulloblastoma.
 
In January 2018, we initiated dosing in a two-part, multi-center, open-label Phase I/IIa clinical study of VBI-1901 in 38 patients with recurrent GBM. Phase I (Part A) of the study was a dose-escalation phase that defined the safety, tolerability, and optimal dose level of VBI-1901 adjuvanted with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in recurrent GBM patients with any number of prior recurrences. In December 2018, this phase completed enrollment of 18 patients across three dose cohorts, the highest of which (10 µg) was selected as the optimal dose level to test in the Phase IIa portion (Part B) of the study. Phase IIa of the study, which initiated enrollment in July 2019, is a two-arm study that enrolled 20 first-recurrent GBM patients to receive 10 µg of VBI-1901 in combination with either GM-CSF or GSK proprietary adjuvant system, AS01, as immunomodulatory adjuvants. AS01 is provided pursuant to a Clinical Collaboration and Support Study Agreement with GSK, which we entered into on September 10, 2019. Enrollment of the 10 patients in the VBI-1901 with GM-CSF arm was completed in March 2020 and enrollment of the 10 patients in the VBI-1901 with AS01 arm was completed in October 2020.
 
Data from the Phase IIa portion of the study was announced throughout 2020, 2021, and 2022, with the latest data presented in November 2022 at the 2022 Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting. The data from the Phase IIa portion of this study demonstrate: (1) improvement in 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month overall survival (“OS”) data compared to historical controls; (2) 12-month OS of 60% (n=6/10) in the VBI-1901 + GM-CSF study arm and 70% (n=7/10) in the VBI-1901 + AS01 study arm, compared to historical controls of ~30%; (3) 18-month OS of 30% (3/10) in the VBI-1901 + GM-CSF study arm and 40% (n=4/10) in the VBI-1901 + AS01 study arm; (3) 2 patients with partial tumor responses, one of whom remained on protocol for over two years and had achieved a 93% tumor reduction relative to baseline at initiation of treatment at the start of the study, and 10 stable disease observations across all study arms; and (4) VBI-1901 continues to be safe and well tolerated at all doses tested, with no safety signals observed.
 
On June 8, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted Fast-Track Designation for VBI-1901 formulated with GM-CSF for the treatment of recurrent GBM patients with first tumor recurrence. The designation was granted based on data from the Phase I/IIa study.
 
On June 22, 2022, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for VBI-1901 for the treatment of GBM.
 
Based on the data seen to-date, as part of the next phase of development we anticipate assessing VBI-1901 in randomized, controlled studies in both primary and recurrent GBM patients. In the recurrent setting, we aim to expand the number of patients in the current trial and add a control arm, with the potential to support an accelerated approval application based on tumor response rates and improvement in overall survival. Subject to discussion with the FDA, the amended protocol is expected to initiate enrollment of additional patients in the second quarter of 2023.
 
On October 12, 2022, we announced a collaboration with Agenus Inc. to evaluate VBI-1901 in combination with anti-PD-1 balstilimab in a Phase II study as part of the INSIGhT adaptive platform trial in patients with primary GBM. Subject to approval from regulatory bodies, we expect enrollment to initiate in the VBI-1901 study arm in INSIGhT mid-year 2023.


Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
 
In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and on March 12, 2020, the WHO declared the global outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, to be a pandemic. Multiple vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 continue to be under development, and certain large, multinational pharmaceutical companies have been granted and continue to seek authorizations for emergency approval by the FDA. The treatments for COVID-19, including symptomatic and supportive therapies, among other things, continue to be updated on a rolling basis by healthcare authorities and agencies.

VBI is closely following changing SARS-CoV-2 characteristics and plans to study the impact of specific mutations that may impact vaccine efficacy and vaccine design. Further investigations are required to understand the impact of specific mutations on viral properties and the effectiveness of vaccines.
 
We have three ongoing clinical studies being conducted, by us or our partners, at clinical sites worldwide: 1) the Phase II study of VBI-2601 and BRII-835 (VIR-2218) at multiple study sites in Asia Pacific countries; 2) the Phase IIa/IIb study of VBI-2601 at multiple study sites in Asian Pacific countries; and 3) the Phase I clinical study of VBI-2901 in Canada. In addition to the active studies, we have planned clinical studies expected to begin in 2023, including two additional studies with VBI-1901. The enrollment of patients at some of the clinical sites in our studies has in the past been suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future COVID-19 outbreaks could suspend such studies again, and may suspend or delay the enrollment of patients at other clinical sites where we are conducting or planning to conduct clinical trials, or lead to the reallocation of resources or limit of access to clinical facilities. Additionally, if our trial participants are unable to travel to or visit our clinical study sites as a result of the reimposition of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from new outbreaks and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, we could experience higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical studies. Such quarantines and other similar restrictions may also require us to temporarily close our clinical sites, research laboratories, or manufacturing facility. Furthermore, if we determine that our trial participants may suffer from exposure to COVID-19 as a result of their participation in our clinical trials, we may voluntarily close certain clinical sites as a safety measure until we reasonably believe that the likelihood of exposure has subsided. As a result, our expected development timelines for VBI-2601, VBI-1901, and our coronavirus vaccine candidates may be negatively impacted.
 
During the years 2020 through 2022, in order to reduce exposure risk to COVID-19, we had fewer employees on site at both our manufacturing facility in Israel, where we manufacture our 3-antigen HBV vaccine and VBI-2601, and at our research and development laboratories in Ottawa, Canada. Further, restrictions on our ability to travel, stay-at-home orders and other similar restrictions on our business limited our ability to support our operations.


The COVID-19 pandemic has materially negatively affected the global economy, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, supply chain issues, global shortages of supplies, materials and products, volatile market conditions and rising global inflation, continue to do so. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and results of operations were adversely affected and, as the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact the global economy, these effects may continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations. The extent to which these effects will continue to impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical studies, our research programs, the recoverability of our assets, and our manufacturing; however, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt or delay our business operations, including with respect to efforts relating to potential business development transactions, and it could continue to disrupt the marketplace which could have an adverse effect on our operations.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia by Memorandum of Association on April 9, 1965 under the name “Alice Arm Molybendum Co.

eVLP Technology Purchase Agreement
 
We are engaged in the inbound licensing of key intellectual property. We identified the need for a vaccine antigen discovery and design platform and, through that certain sale and purchase agreement entered into on July 18, 2011 (the “Sale and Purchase Agreement”) among VBI Cda and ePixis SA (“ePixis”) and the shareholders of ePixis (collectively, the “Sellers”), acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ePixis in order to obtain access to its exclusive rights to key intellectual property covering its eVLP vaccine platform (the “Technology”), including patents (the “Acquired Patents”) covering the Technology. We paid a purchase price of €400 (approximately $450) for the ePixis shares and approximately $75 in related transaction costs. VBI Cda also agreed to make certain contingent payments to the Sellers as follows:

● | Upon the earlier to occur of (i) first approval by the FDA of a new drug application (an “NDA”) permitting us or any sublicensee to market and sell any pharmaceutical product or candidate pharmaceutical product that contains or can express an eVLP (a “eVLP Product”) in the U.S. or (ii) first approval by the European Medicines Agency of a Marketing Authorization Application or equivalent submission permitting us or our sublicensees to market and sell a eVLP Product candidate in one or more countries in the EU, we must pay to the Sellers €1,000, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €500. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | If an eVLP Product is commercialized, we will be required to pay the Sellers the following: 
● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales (as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement), of all eVLP Products equals or exceeds €25,000, we must pay to the Sellers €1,500, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €750; and 
● | On the Date that Cumulative Net Sales of all eVLP Products equals or exceeds €50,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €2,000 or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €1,000. 

 
If any eVLP Product is commercialized by one or more sublicensees, we have agreed to make the following payments to the Sellers:
 

● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales by us or any sublicensees of the eVLP Products equal or exceed €25,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €750, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €375;

Included in the eVLP Acquired Patents were patents (the “UPMC Patents”) co-owned by L’Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, now Sorbonne Université (“UPMC”), and the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (“INSERM”), both in Paris, France. In July 2006, ePixis entered into a license agreement (the “ePixis License Agreement”) with UPMC, INSERM, and L’école Normale Supérieure de Lyon (collectively the “Licensor”) pursuant to which the Licensor granted to ePixis an exclusive license (with the right to sublicense with written consent from UPMC) to exploit the UPMC Patents for the purpose of developing, promoting and marketing products within the U.S., Japan, Canada, and Europe until the expiry of the last of the UPMC Patents, including any supplementary protection certificates. Pursuant to the ePixis License Agreement, ePixis was to pay certain fees to the Licensor based on net sales (as defined in the ePixis License Agreement) of products developed from the UPMC Patents, sublicensing income based on net sales (“Sublicensing Payments”) and one-time payments (“Lump Sum Payments”) for each product developed from the UPMC Patents. ePixis also agreed to reimburse UPMC for fees and costs related to filing and maintaining the patent applications.
 
On July 12, 2011, the parties to the ePixis License Agreement entered into the first amendment to the ePixis License Agreement (the “ePixis Amendment”). The ePixis Amendment authorized the transfer of the ePixis License Agreement to VBI Cda and laid out new financial terms and conditions for the rights granted under the ePixis License Agreement.
 
The ePixis Amendment provides that the fees to be paid to the Licensor by ePixis on net sales of eVLP Products based on the UPMC Patents will be 1.75% of net sales for annual sales between €0 and €50,000, 1% of net sales for annual sales between €50,000 and €100,000, and 0.75% of net sales for annual sales in excess of €100,000. Pursuant to the ePixis Amendment, Lump Sum Payments shall be made as follows:
 

● | €50 when the results from pre-clinical studies are sufficient to allow a product to enter a regulatory filing similar to an IND or a similar entity in a country other than the U.S.; this milestone was met and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the CMV candidate and during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the GBM candidate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the milestone was met for our prophylactic coronavirus vaccine program; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | €150 when the results from pre-clinical studies are sufficient to allow a product into a clinical phase, including Phase I-II clinical studies; this milestone was met and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the CMV candidate; during the year ended December 31, 2018 for the GBM candidate; and during the year ended December 31, 2021 for our prophylactic coronavirus vaccine program; 
● | €250 when a product enters Phase II clinical studies, an event that is defined by the enrollment of the first patient; 
● | €500 when a product enters Phase III clinical studies; and 
● | €1,000 when a product is first marketed. 

 
UPMC is also a co-owner of the patent family covering our VBI-1501 CMV vaccine and we are negotiating extension of our existing license to cover this patent family.
 
Fees on income earned from sublicenses under the ePixis Amendment were revised as follows: 25% of any amounts received by ePixis for the sublicense if the sublicense is entered into prior to the start of Phase I clinical studies; 10% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into during Phase I clinical studies and prior to the start of Phase II clinical studies; 7% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into during Phase II clinical studies and prior to the start of Phase III clinical studies, and 5% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into after the start of Phase III clinical studies. There was no change to the requirement that ePixis reimburse UPMC for fees and costs related to filing and maintaining the patent applications and patents.
 
The parties may terminate the ePixis License Agreement, as amended, by mutual agreement. There is also a cancellation right that may be exercised in the event of breach. UPMC may terminate the ePixis License Agreement if we, among other things, declare bankruptcy; do not put forth reasonable effort or are unable to develop and market the products, and, in particular, if we suspend the development of the products for more than six months; our inability to make the payments required by the ePixis License Agreement; lack of sales of a product, or lack of a signed sub-license agreement within one year from the date of acquiring AMM (Autorisation de mise sur le marché – Regulation of Therapeutic Goods) authorization, or the necessary equivalent authorization for the use of the products; and lack of sales of a product for more than two years after the initial marketing has taken place. During the year-ended December 31, 2016, VBI Cda paid UPMC €200 in milestone payments related to CMV Phase I clinical trial approval and start. During the year ended December 31, 2018, VBI Cda paid UPMC €200, in milestone payments related to the GBM Phase I/IIa clinical trial approval and start.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, VBI Cda paid UPMC €200 in milestone payments related to our prophylactic coronavirus vaccine program clinical trial approval and start. No payments were made during the year ended December 31, 2022.

In Rehovot, Israel, we operate a proprietary, GMP-certified, mammalian cell-derived vaccine manufacturing facility, which we use to manufacture our 3-antigen HBV vaccine, as well as clinical study supply of VBI-2601. The facility was built in December 2006 and most recently received GMP certification renewal by the Ministry of Health of the State of Israel (“IMoH”) on February 6, 2022. It has also received IMoH authorization to release vaccine batches to export markets. In 2013, the EU entered into an agreement with Israel regarding conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products. This agreement recognizes Israel’s industrial standards as being equivalent to EU standards. It covers products for human and veterinary use (medicinal products, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients) and procedures related to GMP. The agreement means that Israel and the EU recognize each other’s GMP inspection conclusions, manufacturing and import authorizations and certification of conformity of batches. In 2021 our facility passed a FDA Remote Interactive Evaluation as part of the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) application process whereby PreHevbrio was approved for use in the U.S.
 
The Canadian research site benefits from its location in Canada’s National Capital Region, providing us with access to world-class research facilities. VBI Cda’s active research collaboration with the Canadian federal government’s NRC provides its staff with on-site access to the NRC’s animal facility for greater control over the testing of our pipeline candidates. NRC staff manages the general animal husbandry and maintenance requirements for VBI Cda’s animal research activities.
 
The three sites collaborate efficiently through the use of a unified information technology infrastructure and web-based video-conferencing services.
 
Competitors
 
Our pipeline candidates face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions. We compete in an industry that is characterized by: rapid technological change; evolving industry standards; emerging competition; and new product introductions. Competitors have existing products and technologies that will compete with our pipeline candidates and technologies and may develop and commercialize additional products and technologies that will compete with our pipeline candidates and technologies. Because several competing companies and institutions may have greater financial resources than us, they may be able to: provide broader services and product lines; make greater investments in research and development (“R&D”); and carry-on larger R&D initiatives. Competitors may also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They may also have greater name recognition and better access to customers.
 
We face general market competition from several subsectors of the vaccine development field, including: large, multinational pharmaceutical companies including Sanofi S.A. (“Sanofi”), GSK, Merck, Janssen Pharmaceutical, Inc (“Janssen”), Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”); large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies including Dynavax, Novavax Inc., Moderna, Inc. (“Moderna”), BioNTech SE, and Hookipa Biotech AG; and academic and not-for-profit vaccine researchers and developers including the National Institutes of Health. The industry is typified by extensive collaboration, licensing, and merger and acquisition activity despite the intense competition.

In the prophylactic HBV vaccine space, we have several key competitors currently commercializing single-antigen HBV vaccines, including: GSK, the manufacturer of Engerix-B and Twinrix, Merck, the manufacturer of Recombivax HB, and Dynavax, the manufacturer of Heplisav-B.
 
Within the therapeutic HBV space, we face both competition from and potential collaboration with other developers of innovative HBV therapeutics designed to achieve a functional cure in combination with other therapeutics. Key large pharmaceutical companies in the space include: GSK, Janssen, Gilead Sciences, Inc, and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”). Additionally, there are a number of mid-size companies developing alternative approaches to treat HBV, including: VIR, Arbutus Biopharma Corp, Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Aligos Therapeutics Inc. It is not yet known which modes of action, or combinations thereof, will lead to a HBV functional cure.
 
Given the significant unmet medical need for GBM, there are numerous competitors seeking to develop new immunotherapies to treat GBM. Among these, Immunomic Therapeutics Inc (“Immunomic”), Immatics Biotechnologies GmBH, Stemline Therapeutics Inc., Mimivax LLC, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc are developing vaccines that are also currently completing clinical studies. Immunomic’s approach also targets CMV antigens associated with GBM using a dendritic cell vaccine. Additional cell-based therapies and oncolytic viruses include those under clinical study by DNAtrix Inc and Transgene SA.
 
Within the COVID vaccine space, over the last three years, more than one hundred vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 were under development; four groups have obtained FDA approval or authorization for emergency use: (i) Pfizer, Inc/BioNTech SE; (ii) Moderna; (iii) J&J/Janssen; and (iv) Novavax. Approvals for additional vaccines targeting COVID-19 and its variants are anticipated. Other key companies in the space with vaccines recognized by the WHO and/or approved for use by other regulatory agencies include AstraZeneca AB, Bharat Biotech International Limited, CanSino Biologics Inc., Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd, Sinopharm/Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd., and Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd. Dozens of additional companies and institutions are running clinical studies, and we expect the COVID space to evolve rapidly over the next year.


Within the CMV vaccine space, we have several key competitors, some of whom are further advanced with their CMV vaccine development. Among these, Moderna’s CMV vaccine is in Phase III, and Hookipa Biotech AG CMV vaccine is in Phase II.
 
Suppliers and Contractors
 
Suppliers
 
We rely on a single source for our supply of vials and certain raw materials required for the manufacturing of our 3-antigen HBV vaccine. We have supply agreements with these vendors intended to assure quality and flow of materials. Alternative sources from which we can obtain our supply of these materials is under assessment. We may not be able to find alternative suppliers in a timely manner that would provide supplies of these materials at acceptable quantities and prices, if at all. Additionally, critical supplies and reagents are also required by our contractors for manufacturing and release testing of our eVLP-based pipeline candidates. Any interruption in the supply of these materials would disrupt our ability to manufacture our 3-antigen HBV vaccine and our pipeline candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Contractors
 
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations (“CROs”) for clinical trials and contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs’) for manufacturing of our eVLP vaccine candidates. We also enter into contracts in the normal course of operations with vendors for research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice.

We engage CRO’s to conduct our clinical programs including the GBM Phase I/IIa clinical program and our prophylactic coronavirus vaccine program. Our reliance on these CRO’s reduces our control over these activities and involves certain risks. See “Risk Factors” on page 27 for more information regarding the risks associated with our reliance on CROs.
 
We engage CDMOs to manufacture our eVLP vaccine candidates and these CDMOs are dependent on sourcing raw materials from third party suppliers. Our reliance on these CDMOs reduces our control over these activities and involves certain risks. See “Risk Factors” on page 27 for more information regarding the risks associated with our reliance on CDMOs.


We rely on a number of contractors to provide services to characterize and release our 3-antigen HBV vaccine. While alternative contractors exist for these services, we may not be able to transition to alternative contractors in a manner that does not disrupt the normal course of manufacturing operations and the supply of our 3-antigen HBV vaccine.
 
Our novel vaccine development efforts depend on a number of key suppliers to continue our research operations. We have identified the following parties as key suppliers of reagents, technology, or expertise which impact our development plans with our eVLP pipeline candidates:
 

● | UPMC is the owner of the eVLP vaccine platform intellectual property portfolio to which we have an exclusive license. Under the terms of the ePixis License Agreement, as amended, we are required to pay royalties for successful products developed using the intellectual property for as long as patent claims cover the period in a given jurisdiction. This patent portfolio has claims that are expected to remain in force until 2023 in the U.S., after which time we are no longer obligated to compensate UPMC for development of vaccines based on the UPMC intellectual property portfolio. After that time, the remaining patent protection of the CMV vaccine candidate will be based on patents and patent applications co-owned with UPMC which, if granted, would provide patent protection extending until 2032. We are negotiating an agreement with UPMC to cover the CMV patents and patent applications. There can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will be granted or, if granted, will be enforceable, and the claims in pending patent applications may be amended to reduce the scope of patent claims.

● | We have collaborated with NRC on various vaccine projects since 2004 and have a long history of successful partnerships including several NRC-administered industrial research grants. The NRC developed a proprietary cell line (HEK-293-NRC) that we are using for production of our eVLP-based vaccine candidates. VBI Cda and the NRC have signed a research agreement that provides VBI Cda with access to NRC facilities and expertise for the advancement of our vaccine candidate programs. Supplementary to such research agreement, we negotiated terms for a non-exclusive license to the HEK-293-NRC cell line. Under these terms, we were required to pay success-based milestone payments until the patents on the cell line expired in November of 2018. We are collaborating with NRC to develop a coronavirus vaccine candidate. The collaboration combines our viral vaccine expertise, eVLP technology platform, and coronavirus antigens with the NRC’s uniquely designed SARS-CoV-2 antigens and assay development capabilities to select the most immunogenic vaccine candidate for further development. The scope of collaboration includes certain pre-clinical evaluations, bioprocess optimization, technology transfer, and the performance of additional scale up work. 


● | Key Reagent Suppliers: Characterization and release assays for our eVLP-based vaccines require specialized reagents. Several key reagents including reference proteins and growth media are provided by third parties and can impact development timelines. We have secured sufficient quantities of third-party reference proteins and growth media for ongoing and planned clinical studies. Supply of these key reagents remains a risk. See “Risk Factors” on page 27 for more information regarding the risks associated with our reliance on key reagents. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, depend on subcontractor arrangements to facilitate the completion of our research programs. Catalent Biologics, previously Paragon Bioservices, has manufactured clinical batches of our CMV vaccine candidate and our GBM immunotherapeutic vaccine candidate pursuant to the terms of a GMP-Manufacturing Services Agreement dated September 26, 2014. Resilience Biotechnologies, previously Therapure Biopharma Inc., manufactures clinical batches of our prophylactic coronavirus vaccine program and our GBM immunotherapeutic vaccine candidate pursuant to the terms of a Master Service and Supply Agreement dated November 10, 2020.

We are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment that promotes fairness and values each team members’ unique experience and contribution to the workplace. By bringing together individuals with varying backgrounds, expertise, and perspectives into an inclusive and collaborative work environment, we believe we can better achieve our corporate objectives and deliver long-term, sustained value for key stakeholders – patients, healthcare providers, and shareholders. We review our internal diversity statistics on an annual basis, and while we believe we have created a team that is inclusive, we continually strive to better our diversity profile, including by: (i) improving the rate of self-identification with our internal workforce; and (ii) increasing access to groups where we don’t have representation by working with certain academic centers and recruiters, and by leveraging diverse job boards and employment centers.
 
We also strongly believe that all employees should be treated with respect, and we strictly enforce our Non-Discrimination, Anti-Harassment, and Anti-Retaliation Policies to protect and maintain a safe, respected, and supportive workplace environment for all employees.


Facilities and Offices
 
Our registered office is located at Suite 1700, Park Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC V6C 2X8 with our headquarters located at 160 Second Street, Floor 3, Cambridge, MA, 02142. Our manufacturing operations are located in Rehovot, Israel and our primary research facility is located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, refer to “Part I – Item 2. Properties.”
 
We rent office, manufacturing and research facility space under various operating leases, and we made rent payments of $1,865 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
 
We believe that our office, manufacturing, and research facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations but will consider term extensions or expansion of leased space, depending on market conditions and needs.
 
Research and Development
 
We invest heavily in R&D. R&D expenses were $15.5 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All R&D was funded by equity financings, term loan financings, collaboration agreements, funding agreements or government grants and contributions. Our most significant R&D expenses to date have been related to the development of our 3-antigen HBV vaccine, followed by the development of our GBM vaccine immunotherapeutic candidate (VBI-1901), our prophylactic coronavirus vaccine candidates (VBI-2900), our CMV candidate (VBI-1501), and the related eVLP platform. We continue to invest in and advance our lead pipeline candidates. In addition, we may bring other pipeline candidates through the clinical development stage and explore other vaccine opportunities and/or collaborations.
Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
Our intellectual property portfolio includes 19 active patent families consisting of 196 fully owned or co-owned or exclusively licensed patents and patent applications. The highlights of our patent portfolio include:

● | eVLP vaccine related intellectual property: we have an exclusive license to a patent family that protect the eVLP vaccine platform and derivatives thereof. Among these patents are rights that were originally developed at the UPMC (now Sorbonne Universite), for which we hold a world-wide exclusive license to the base technology for the design of an eVLP.

● | HBV Immunotherapeutic candidate related intellectual property: we own or co-own two patent families which directly address our HBV immunotherapeutic candidate. These patent applications include claims to compositions of matter and methods of treating HBV patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Coronavirus vaccine candidate related intellectual property: we own or co-own two patent families which directly addresses our coronavirus vaccine candidates. These patent applications include claims to compositions of matter and methods of treating a subject at risk of COVID-19 infection. 
● | Lipid Particle Vaccines (“LPV”) vaccine related intellectual property: we own six patent families which protect our LPV technology platform. These patents include the method for manufacturing an LPV so as to confer thermostability, the proprietary ratios of excipients and antigens that are required to give rise to a thermostable formulation, and specific parameters required to confer thermostability to several distinct classes of vaccine antigens and biologic proteins. 

 
We continuously monitor the competitive landscape for infectious disease vaccines to better understand the research, business, and patent activities of our academic and industrial competitors. This process helps management to understand the competitive positioning of our pipeline. This knowledge has informed and shaped our patent portfolio, which is designed to protect our proprietary vaccine technologies and establish a defense against third-party infringement claims. Our licensed patent family relating to virus-like particles has a patent whose term extends to 2023 in the U.S. Our most recently filed patent family will have a patent term that extends to 2041.
 
Trade Secrets
 
Some of our know-how and technology is not patentable. To protect our proprietary rights in unpatentable intellectual property and trade secrets, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into agreements regarding intellectual property and confidential information.
Trademarks
 
We use the PreHevbrio, PreHevbri, and Sci-B-Vac trademarks in connection with our 3-antigen HBV vaccine. These trademarks are registered in 12 countries. There are two pending marks in the U.S. and one pending mark in Norway. There is one registered European Community mark. The trademarks are renewable indefinitely, so long as we make the appropriate filings when required. We also have a registration for the LPV mark in Canada.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
 
Vaccine development is a highly regulated field. The manufacturing and marketing of our products and product candidates and our ongoing research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies of local, state, and foreign jurisdictions, such as Health Canada in Canada, the EMA in Europe, and the MHRA in the UK. New products must go through extensive pre-clinical and clinical development prior to product launch. This process can take more than ten years from candidate identification to licensure/marketing approval by health authorities worldwide. Despite efforts to harmonize regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, there exists a divergence of legal and regulatory requirements in different countries and territories. Delays in regulatory approval to move from one stage of development to another can potentially cause us significant delays and can affect our market capitalization.
U.S., Europe, and Canada Regulatory Agencies
 
Before any of our products can be marketed and sold in the U.S., Europe, or Canada, they must receive approval from the relevant regulatory agencies, including the FDA, EMA, UK MHRA, and Health Canada. To receive regulatory approvals to market any drug or vaccine, including those we develop, the products in development must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory path includes process controls in development, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of the pharmaceutical products.

20
--

 

In general, before any new pharmaceutical or biological product can be marketed in the mentioned geographical areas, the process typically required by the regulatory agencies includes:
 

● | Pre-clinical toxicology, laboratory, and animal tests; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an investigational new drug application (an “IND”) in the U.S., which must be reviewed by the FDA before human clinical trials may begin; submission of a Scientific Advice application to EMA and/or MHRA in Europe; or submission of a Clinical Trial Application to Health Canada; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigator sites; 
● | submission of a NDA, or in the case of a biologics, a BLA, to the FDA, a MAA to the EMA and /or MHRA, or a NDS to Health Canada; and 
● | FDA approval of an NDA, BLA, or a supplement (for subsequent indications or other modifications, including a change in location of the manufacturing facility), EMA and/or MHRA approval of a MAA, or Health Canada approval of a NDS. 

Pre-clinical Testing
 
In the U.S., drug candidates are tested in animals until adequate proof of safety and efficacy is established. These pre-clinical studies generally evaluate the mechanism of action and pharmacology of the product and assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Tested compounds must be produced according to applicable cGMP requirements and pre-clinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with FDA and international regulations regarding good laboratory practices. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are generally submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA requests an extension or raises concerns about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the application. If the FDA has any concerns, the sponsor of the application and the FDA must resolve those concerns before clinical trials may begin. Regulatory authorities may require additional pre-clinical data before allowing the clinical studies to commence or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that the studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials for new vaccine drug candidates are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the vaccine drug candidate into human volunteers, the emphasis is on testing for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and clinical pharmacology. Phase II involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the vaccine drug candidate for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a vaccine compound shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, pivotal Phase III trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes and to establish the overall risk/benefit profile of the drug, and to provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. During all clinical trials, physicians will monitor patients to determine the effectiveness of the drug candidate and to observe and report any reactions or safety risks that may result from use of the vaccine drug candidate. The FDA, the trial sites internal review board, and/or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

21
--

 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each BLA submitted for FDA approval is usually given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the BLA. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the BLA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of six months for priority BLAs (for biologics addressing serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need) and ten months for regular BLAs. However, these are agency proposed time frames, and so the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not typically an actual approval, but an “action letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the BLA can be approved. The FDA’s review of a BLA may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA or BLA supplement if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or the FDA may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical study. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the BLA does not satisfy its criteria for approval.
 
Data Review and Approval
 
Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials, and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies. It normally takes many years to satisfy these various legal and regulatory requirements, assuming they are ever satisfied. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. We cannot assure you that we will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture and/or market potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on it that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products.
 
Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA also has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA may also request additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase IV studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. The results of Phase IV studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information via the FDA’s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to any FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug, or revoke or suspend a biologics license. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown negative effects of a product may result in restrictions on the product or even its complete withdrawal from the market.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics. Approval is typically subject to post-marketing surveillance and other record keeping and reporting obligations, and involves ongoing requirements such as post-marketing annual reports and labeling updates. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and/or criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of such off-label use.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we have received, or may, in the future, receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label” use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (or “REMS”) to assure the safe use of the product, which may require substantial commitment of resources post-approval to ensure compliance. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the quality and long-term stability of commercial products. We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our CMOs that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below.
 

23

Once an approval or clearance of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information. 

 
In addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the U.S., including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
The commercial success of any biopharmaceutical products approved by the FDA depends in significant part on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for the products.
 
In the U.S., third-party payors include government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, managed care plans, and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists regarding coverage and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products. Coverage does not ensure adequate reimbursement. It is time-consuming and expensive to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication or utilize other mechanisms to manage utilization (such as requiring prior authorization for coverage for a product for use in a particular patient). Limits on coverage may impact demand for our products. Even if coverage is obtained, third-party reimbursement may not be adequate to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. As result, we may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA)
 
Under the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”), enacted in 2010, and specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) included therein, there is an abbreviated path in the United States for regulatory approval of biosimilar versions of approved biological products. The Affordable Care Act provides a regulatory mechanism that enables FDA approval of biologic drugs that are similar to (but not exact copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. Under this regulation, an application for approval of a biosimilar may not be filed until four years after marketing approval of the innovator product. Pioneer innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA will not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA.
Fast Track Approval
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), as amended, and the related FDA regulations provide certain mechanisms for the accelerated “Fast Track” approval of potential products intended to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses which have demonstrated the potential to address unmet medical needs. These procedures permit early consultation and commitment from the FDA regarding the pre-clinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval. Provisions of this regulatory framework also permit, in certain cases, BLAs to be approved on the basis of valid indirect measurements of benefit of product effectiveness, thus accelerating the normal approval process. In the future, certain potential products employing our technology might qualify for this accelerated regulatory procedure. Even if the FDA agrees that these potential products qualify for accelerated approval procedures, FDA may deny approval of our drugs or may require additional studies before approval. The FDA may also require us to perform post-approval, or Phase IV, studies as a condition of such early approval. In addition, the FDA may impose restrictions on distribution and/or promotion in connection with any accelerated approval, and may withdraw approval if post-approval studies do not confirm the intended clinical benefit or safety of the potential product.
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. These very limited circumstances are (i) an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or (ii) a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy. This exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will continue to be subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval, we must separately obtain approval for clinical trials or a marketing authorization by the comparable regulatory authorities of those foreign countries before we may commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

Legal and compliance landscapes, as well as the policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
Under the applicable EU regulatory regime, we may submit marketing authorization applications (MAAs) either under a centralized or decentralized procedure (which also includes the mutual recognition procedure available for companies who already hold national licenses). The decentralized procedures provide for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. These authorizations provide marketing authorizations. The centralized procedure, which is available for medicines, inter alia, produced by biotechnology, intended to treat specific illnesses, or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states (as well as in Northern Ireland and the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway).
 
The procedure for obtaining marketing authorizations in the United Kingdom has been affected by Brexit, which took place on January 31, 2020. A transitional period was in place until December 31, 2020, during which time regulation of pharmaceuticals was still governed by EU law. As of January 1, 2021, the UK MHRA has implemented new procedures for MAAs. Among these new procedures is a Great Britain marketing authorization that relies on a decision taken by the European Commission (“EC”) in respect of a marketing authorization for the same product in the centralized procedure. This route – the EC decision reliance procedure (“ECDRP”) – is currently available to all authorizations approved in the centralized procedure.
 
Other Government Regulation
 
Our research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that may be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and federal, provincial and state environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act.
 
In addition, in the U.S., we may be subject to various federal and state laws and regulations regarding fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, as well as industry standards and guidance, such as the codes issued by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (or “PhRMA Codes”), which some states reference or incorporate in their statutes and regulations. These laws, regulations, standards, and guidance may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing activities and our relationships with healthcare providers and patients. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:
 

● | The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, as amended, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements; 
● | The anti-inducement law (Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; 
● | The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.), which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and 
● | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A of the Social Security Act), which authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts.

These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from Medicare and other government programs. Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to comply with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect the arrangements we may have with sales personnel, healthcare providers, and patients. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations. If our past or present operations, practices, or activities are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual remedies, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, if any, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
