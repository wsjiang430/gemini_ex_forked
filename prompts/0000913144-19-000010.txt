OVERVIEW
RenaissanceRe is a global provider of reinsurance and insurance. We provide property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance solutions to customers, principally through intermediaries. Established in 1993, we have offices in Bermuda, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), and the U.S. Our operating subsidiaries include Renaissance Reinsurance, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Inc. (“Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.”), RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. Ltd. (“RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S.”), Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe Unlimited Company (“Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe”) and our Lloyd’s syndicate, RenaissanceRe Syndicate 1458 (“Syndicate 1458”). We also underwrite reinsurance on behalf of joint ventures, including Top Layer Reinsurance Ltd. (“Top Layer Re”), Upsilon RFO Re Ltd. (“Upsilon RFO”), DaVinci Reinsurance Ltd. (“DaVinci”), Vermeer Reinsurance Ltd. (“Vermeer”) and Fibonacci Reinsurance Ltd. ("Fibonacci Re"). In addition, through RenaissanceRe Medici Fund Ltd. (“Medici”), we invest in various insurance based investment instruments that have returns primarily tied to property catastrophe risk.
We aspire to be the world’s best underwriter by matching well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital and our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We seek to accomplish these goals by being a trusted, long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk, delivering responsive and innovative solutions, leveraging our core capabilities of risk assessment and information management, investing in these core capabilities in order to serve our customers across the cycles that have historically characterized our markets and keeping our promises. Our strategy focuses on superior risk selection, superior customer relationships and superior capital management. We provide value to our customers and joint venture partners in the form of financial security, innovative products, and responsive service. We are known as a leader in paying valid claims promptly. We principally measure our financial success through long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends, which we believe is the most appropriate measure of our financial performance and in respect of which we believe we have delivered superior performance over time.
Our core products include property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and certain insurance products principally distributed through intermediaries, with whom we seek to cultivate strong long-term relationships. We believe we have been one of the world’s leading providers of catastrophe reinsurance since our founding. In recent years, through the strategic execution of a number of initiatives, including organic growth and acquisitions, we have expanded our casualty and specialty platform and products and believe we are a leader in certain casualty and specialty lines of business. We have determined our business consists of the following reportable segments: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain joint ventures managed by our ventures unit, and (2) Casualty and Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain joint ventures managed by our ventures unit.
To best serve our clients in the places they do business, we have operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and underwriting platforms around the world, including DaVinci, Renaissance Reinsurance, Top Layer Re, Fibonacci Re, Upsilon RFO and Vermeer in Bermuda, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. in the U.S., and Syndicate 1458 in the U.K. We write property and casualty and specialty reinsurance through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries, joint ventures and Syndicate 1458 and certain insurance products primarily 
3

through Syndicate 1458. Although each underwriting platform may write any or all of our classes of business, our Bermuda platform has traditionally written, and continues to write, the preponderance of our property business and our U.S. platform and Syndicate 1458 write a significant portion of our casualty and specialty business. Syndicate 1458 provides us with access to Lloyd’s extensive distribution network and worldwide licenses and also writes business through delegated authority arrangements. The underwriting results of our operating subsidiaries and underwriting platforms are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segment results as appropriate.
Since a meaningful portion of the reinsurance and insurance we write provides protection from damages relating to natural and man-made catastrophes, our results depend to a large extent on the frequency and severity of such catastrophic events, and the coverages we offer to customers affected by these events. We are exposed to significant losses from these catastrophic events and other exposures we cover. Accordingly, we expect a significant degree of volatility in our financial results and our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year, based on the level of insured catastrophic losses occurring around the world. We view our exposure to casualty and specialty lines of business as an efficient use of capital given these risks are generally less correlated with our property lines of business. This has allowed us to bring additional capacity to our clients, across a wider range of product offerings, while continuing to be good stewards of our shareholders’ capital.
We continually explore appropriate and efficient ways to address the risk needs of our clients and the impact of various regulatory and legislative changes on our operations. We have created and managed, and continue to manage, multiple capital vehicles across a number of jurisdictions and may create additional risk bearing vehicles or enter into additional jurisdictions in the future. In addition, our differentiated strategy and capability position us to pursue bespoke or large solutions for clients, which may be non-recurring. This, and other factors including the timing of contract inception, could result in significant volatility of premiums in both our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. As our product and geographical diversity increases, we may be exposed to new risks, uncertainties and sources of volatility.
ACQUISTION OF TOKIO MILLENNIUM RE AND STATE FARM STOCK PURCHASE
Acquisition of Tokio Millennium Re
On October 30, 2018, we entered into the a Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. (“Tokio”) and, with respect to certain sections only, Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc. (the “TMR Stock Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to cause our wholly owned subsidiary RenaissanceRe Specialty Holdings (UK) Limited to purchase all of the share capital of Tokio Millennium Re AG, Tokio Millennium Re (UK) Limited and their subsidiaries (collectively, the “TMR Group Entities”) (the “TMR Stock Purchase”). The TMR Group Entities comprise the treaty reinsurance business of Tokio Marine Holdings, Inc., including its third party capital management fronting business. The TMR Stock Purchase is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to the closing conditions set forth in the TMR Stock Purchase Agreement, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. If consummated, the transaction would add a large portfolio of reinsurance risk to our own portfolio, currently representing approximately $1.3 billion of incremental reinsurance premium. Following the closing, we anticipate re-underwriting this portfolio over time, and currently estimate that, in light of our existing risk appetite, we will target approximately $700.0 million of gross reinsurance premiums. We will continue to evaluate the TMR Group Entities’ operations in the period prior to closing, and it is possible that our analysis or views will evolve. We cannot assure you that the current cedants or other business partners of the TMR Group Entities will renew their business with us, and renewal of the current TMR Group Entities portfolio is not a condition to closing of the TMR Stock Purchase. Moreover, in the near to medium term we expect operational expenses to increase as we undertake the process of integrating the TMR Group Entities and their operations into our own after the closing. See “Note 20. Acquisition of Tokio Millennium Re” for additional information regarding the TMR Stock Purchase.
State Farm Stock Purchase
On December 20, 2018, we issued 1,947,496 of our common shares to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“State Farm”) in exchange for $250.0 million in a private placement pursuant to an Investment Agreement we entered into with State Farm on October 30, 2018.

CORPORATE STRATEGY
We aspire to be the world’s best underwriter by matching well-structured risks with efficient sources of capital and our mission is to produce superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. Our strategy for achieving these objectives, which is supported by our core values, our principles and our culture, is to operate an integrated system of what we believe are our three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships, superior risk selection and superior capital management. We believe all three competitive advantages are required to achieve our objectives, and we aim to seamlessly coordinate the delivery of these competitive advantages for the benefit of our ceding insurers, brokers, investors in our joint ventures and shareholders. 
Superior Customer Relationships. We seek to be a trusted long-term partner to our customers for assessing and managing risk and delivering responsive solutions. We believe our modeling and technical expertise, our risk management products and our track record of keeping our promises have made us a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We seek to offer stable, predictable and consistent risk-based pricing and a prompt turnaround on claims.
Superior Risk Selection. We seek to build a portfolio of risks that produces an attractive risk-adjusted return on utilized capital. We develop a perspective of each risk using both our underwriters’ expertise and sophisticated risk selection techniques, including computer models and databases such as Renaissance Exposure Management System (“REMS©”). We pursue a disciplined approach to underwriting and seek to select only those risks that we believe will produce a portfolio with an attractive return, subject to prudent risk constraints. We manage our portfolio of risks dynamically, both within sub-portfolios and across the Company.
Superior Capital Management. We seek to write as much attractively priced business as is available to us and then manage our capital accordingly. We generally seek to raise capital when we forecast increased demand in the market, at times by accessing capital through joint ventures or other structures, and seek to return capital to our shareholders or joint venture investors when the demand for our coverages appears to decline and when we believe a return of capital would be beneficial to our shareholders or joint venture investors. In using joint ventures, we aim to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on an efficient capital base, develop fee income, generate profit commissions, diversify our portfolio and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital providers. We routinely evaluate and review potential joint venture opportunities and strategic investments.
We believe we are well positioned to fulfill our objectives by virtue of the experience and skill of our management team, our integrated and flexible underwriting and operating platform, our significant financial strength, our strong relationships with brokers and customers, our commitment to superior service and our proprietary modeling technology. In particular, we believe our strategy, high performance culture, and commitment to our customers and joint venture partners help us to differentiate ourselves by offering specialized services and products at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited.
SEGMENTS
Our reportable segments are defined as follows: (1) Property, which is comprised of catastrophe and other property reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain joint ventures managed by our ventures unit, and (2) Casualty and Specialty, which is comprised of casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance written on behalf of our operating subsidiaries and certain joint ventures managed by our ventures unit. In addition to our two reportable segments, we have an Other category, which primarily includes our strategic investments, investments unit, corporate expenses, capital servicing costs, noncontrolling interests, certain expenses related to acquisitions and the remnants of our former Bermuda-based insurance operations. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments accounted for 53.2% and 46.8%, respectively, of our gross premiums written. Operating results relating to our segments are included in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Total gross premiums written | $ | 3,310,427 | | | $ | 2,797,540 | | $ | 2,374,576

We write proportional business as well as excess of loss business. In addition, we maintain delegated authority arrangements through Syndicate 1458, which are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments, as appropriate. Our relative mix of business between proportional business and excess of loss business has fluctuated in the past and will likely vary in the future. Proportional and delegated authority business typically have relatively higher premiums per unit of expected underwriting income, together with a higher acquisition expense ratio and combined ratio, than traditional excess of loss reinsurance, as these coverages tend to be exposed to relatively more attritional, and frequent, losses while being subject to less expected severity. 
The following table shows gross premiums written allocated between excess of loss, proportional and delegated authority for each of our segments:

Year ended December 31, 2018 | Property | | Casualty and Specialty | | Other | | Total

Property Segment
Our Property segment includes our catastrophe class of business, principally comprised of excess of loss reinsurance and excess of loss retrocessional reinsurance to insure insurance and reinsurance companies against natural and man-made catastrophes, and our other property class of business, primarily comprised of proportional reinsurance, property per risk, property (re)insurance, binding facilities and regional U.S. multi-line reinsurance. The following table shows gross premiums written in our Property segment allocated by class of business:
Year ended December 31, | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
(in thousands) | | | | | | 
Catastrophe | $ | 1,349,324 | | | $ | 1,104,450 | | $ | 884,361 
Other property | 411,602 | | | 335,987 | | | 226,902 | 
Total Property segment gross premiums written | $ | 1,760,926 | | | $ | 1,440,437 | | $ | 1,111,263

We write catastrophe reinsurance and insurance coverage protecting against large natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, as well as claims arising from other natural and man-made catastrophes such as winter storms, freezes, floods, fires, windstorms, tornadoes, explosions and acts of terrorism. We offer this coverage to insurance companies and other reinsurers primarily on an excess of loss basis. This means we begin paying when our customers’ claims from a catastrophe exceed a certain retained amount. We also offer proportional coverages and other structures on a catastrophe-exposed basis and may increase these offerings on an absolute or relative basis in the future.
As noted above, our excess of loss property contracts generally cover all natural perils, and our predominant exposure under such coverage is to property damage. However, other risks, including business interruption and other non-property losses, may also be covered under our property reinsurance contracts when arising from a covered peril. 
We offer our coverages on a worldwide basis. Because of the wide range of possible catastrophic events to which we are exposed, including the size of such events and the potential for multiple events to occur in the same time period, our property business is volatile and our financial condition and results of operations reflect this volatility. To moderate the volatility of our risk portfolio, we may increase or decrease our presence in the property business based on market conditions and our assessment of risk-adjusted pricing adequacy. We frequently purchase reinsurance or other protection for our own account for a number of reasons, including to optimize the expected outcome of our underwriting portfolio, to manage capital requirements for regulated entities and to reduce the financial impact that a large catastrophe or a series of catastrophes could have on our results.
7

Casualty and Specialty Segment
We write casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance covering primarily targeted classes of business where we believe we have a sound basis for underwriting and pricing the risk we assume. Principally all of the business is reinsurance, however our book of insurance business has been increasing in recent periods, and may continue to do so. The following table shows gross premiums written in our Casualty and Specialty segment allocated by class of business:
Year ended December 31, | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
(in thousands) | | | | | | 
Professional liability (1) | $ | 485,851 | | | $ | 452,310 | | $ | 377,580 
General casualty (2) | 453,097 | | | 417,880 | | | 327,939 | 
Financial lines (3) | 352,902 | | | 303,800 | | | 413,068 | 
Other (4) | 257,651 | | | 183,120 | | | 144,726 | 
Total Casualty and Specialty segment gross premiums written | $ | 1,549,501 | | | $ | 1,357,110 | | $ | 1,263,313


(1) | Includes directors and officers, medical malpractice, and professional indemnity. 
(2) | Includes automobile liability, casualty clash, employer’s liability, umbrella or excess casualty, workers’ compensation and general liability 
(3) | Includes financial guaranty, mortgage guaranty, political risk, surety and trade credit. 
(4) | Includes accident and health, agriculture, aviation, cyber, energy, marine, satellite and terrorism. Lines of business such as regional multi-line and whole account may have characteristics of various other classes of business, and are allocated accordingly.

In recent years, we have expanded our Casualty and Specialty segment operations through organic growth initiatives and acquisitions, and we plan to continue to expand these operations over time if market conditions are appropriate. 
Our Casualty and Specialty segment gross premiums written may be subject to significant volatility as certain lines of business in this segment can be influenced by a small number of relatively large transactions. We seek to underwrite these lines using a disciplined underwriting approach and sophisticated analytical tools. We generally target lines of business where we believe we can adequately quantify the risks assumed and provide coverage where we believe our underwriting is robust and the market is attractive. We also seek to identify market dislocations and write new lines of business whose risk and return characteristics are estimated to exceed our hurdle rates. Furthermore, we also seek to manage the correlations of this business with our overall portfolio. We believe that our underwriting and analytical capabilities have positioned us well to manage our casualty and specialty business.
We offer our casualty and specialty reinsurance products principally on a proportional basis, and we also provide excess of loss coverage. These products frequently include tailored features such as limits or sub-limits which we believe help us manage our exposures. Any liability exceeding, or otherwise not subject to, such limits reverts to the cedant. Our Casualty and Specialty segment frequently provides coverage for relatively large limits or exposures, and thus we are subject to potential significant claims volatility.
Our Casualty and Specialty segment offers certain casualty insurance products through Syndicate 1458 including, but not limited to, general liability, medical malpractice and professional liability. Syndicate 1458 also writes business through delegated authority arrangements. 
As a result of our financial strength, we have the ability to offer significant capacity and, for select risks, we have made available significant limits. We believe these capabilities, the strength of our casualty and specialty reinsurance underwriting team, and our demonstrated ability and willingness to pay valid claims are competitive advantages of our casualty and specialty reinsurance business. While we believe that these and other initiatives will support growth in our Casualty and Specialty segment, we intend to continue to apply our disciplined underwriting approach which, together with current and forecasted market conditions, is likely to temper such growth in current and near-term periods.

Other
Our Other category primarily includes the results of: (1) our share of strategic investments in certain markets we believe offer attractive risk-adjusted returns or where we believe our investment adds value, and where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with other market participants; (2) our investment unit which manages and invests the funds generated by our consolidated operations; (3) corporate expenses, certain expenses related to acquisitions, capital servicing costs and noncontrolling interests; and (4) the remnants of our former Bermuda-based insurance operations.
Geographic Breakdown
Our exposures are generally diversified across geographic zones, but are also a function of market conditions and opportunities. Our largest exposure has historically been to the U.S. and Caribbean market, which represented 49.7% of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2018. A significant amount of our U.S. and Caribbean premium provides coverage against windstorms (mainly U.S. Atlantic hurricanes), earthquakes and other natural and man-made catastrophes. 
The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of our gross premiums written allocated to the territory of coverage exposure:

VENTURES
We pursue a number of other opportunities through our ventures unit, which has responsibility for creating and managing our joint ventures, executing customized reinsurance transactions to assume or cede risk and managing certain investments directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance.
Managed Joint Ventures
We actively manage a number of joint ventures which provide us with an additional presence in the market, enhance our client relationships and generate fee income and profit commissions. These joint ventures allow us to leverage our access to business and our underwriting capabilities on a larger capital base. Currently, our principal joint ventures include DaVinci, Top Layer Re, Langhorne (comprised of Langhorne Holdings LLC (“Langhorne Holdings”) and Langhorne Partners LLC (“Langhorne Partners”)(collectively, “Langhorne”)), Medici, Upsilon RFO, RenaissanceRe Upsilon Fund Ltd. (“Upsilon Fund”), Vermeer and Fibonacci Re. Renaissance Underwriting Managers, Ltd. (“RUM”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as the exclusive underwriting manager for each of these joint ventures except Langhorne, Medici and Upsilon Fund.
DaVinci
DaVinci was established in 2001 and principally writes property catastrophe reinsurance and certain low frequency, high severity specialty reinsurance lines of business on a global basis. In general, we seek to construct for DaVinci a portfolio with risk characteristics similar to those of Renaissance Reinsurance’s property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio, and from time to time, certain lines of specialty reinsurance written by Renaissance Reinsurance such as terrorism and workers’ compensation. In accordance with DaVinci’s underwriting guidelines, it can only participate in business also underwritten by Renaissance Reinsurance. We maintain majority voting control of DaVinci’s holding company, DaVinciRe, and accordingly, consolidate the results of DaVinciRe into our consolidated results of operations and financial position. The underwriting results of DaVinciRe are principally included in our Property segment. We seek to manage DaVinci’s capital efficiently over time in light of the market opportunities and needs we perceive and believe we are able to serve. DaVinciRe is managed by RUM in return for a management fee and performance based incentive fee. Our noncontrolling economic ownership in DaVinciRe was 22.1% at December 31, 2018 (2017 - 22.1%). 
We expect our noncontrolling economic ownership in DaVinciRe to fluctuate over time. 
Top Layer Re
Top Layer Re was established in 1999 and writes high excess non-U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance. Top Layer Re is owned 50% by State Farm and 50% by Renaissance Reinsurance. State Farm provides $3.9 billion of stop loss reinsurance coverage to Top Layer Re. Top Layer Re is managed by RUM in return for a management fee. We account for our equity ownership in Top Layer Re under the equity method of accounting and our proportionate share of its results is reflected in equity in earnings of other ventures in our consolidated statements of operations.
Medici
Medici is an exempted fund, incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. Medici’s objective is to invest substantially all of its assets in various insurance-based investment instruments that have returns primarily correlated to property catastrophe risk. Third-party investors subscribe for the majority of the participating, non-voting common shares of Medici. We maintain majority voting control of Medici’s parent, RenaissanceRe Fund Holdings Ltd. (“Fund Holdings”), therefore the results of Medici and Fund Holdings are consolidated in our financial statements. Medici is managed by RenaissanceRe Fund Management Ltd. in return for a management fee. Our economic ownership in Medici was 16.6% at December 31, 2018 (2017 - 26.8%).
Upsilon RFO
In 2013, we formed a managed joint venture, Upsilon RFO, a Bermuda domiciled special purpose insurer (“SPI”), to provide additional capacity to the worldwide aggregate and per-occurrence primary and 
10

retrocessional property catastrophe excess of loss market. Upsilon RFO enhances our efforts to match desirable reinsurance risk with efficient capital through a strategic capital structure. Original business is written directly by Upsilon RFO under fully-collateralized reinsurance contracts capitalized through the sale of non-voting shares to us and Upsilon Fund. Upsilon RFO is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”) as it has insufficient equity capital to finance its activities without additional financial support and we are the primary beneficiary. As a result, we consolidate Upsilon RFO and all significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Other than our equity investment, we have not provided any financial or other support to Upsilon RFO that we were not contractually required to provide.
Upsilon Fund
We incorporated Upsilon Fund, an exempted Bermuda limited segregated accounts company, in 2014. Upsilon Fund was formed to provide a fund structure through which third party investors can invest in property reinsurance risk managed by us. As a segregated accounts company, Upsilon Fund is permitted to establish segregated accounts to invest in and hold identified pools of assets and liabilities. Each pool of assets and liabilities in each segregated account is ring-fenced from any claims from the creditors of Upsilon Fund’s general account and from the creditors of other segregated accounts within Upsilon Fund. Third party investors purchase redeemable, non-voting preference shares linked to specific segregated accounts of Upsilon Fund and own 100% of these shares. Upsilon Fund is managed by RenaissanceRe Fund Management Ltd. in return for a management fee and performance based incentive fee. We have not provided any financial or other support to Upsilon Fund that we were not contractually required to provide. Currently, Upsilon Fund is invested in Upsilon RFO and Medici.
Vermeer
Effective December 17, 2018, we formed Vermeer, an exempted Bermuda reinsurer, with PGGM, a Dutch pension fund manager. Vermeer provides capacity focused on risk remote layers in the U.S. property catastrophe market. Vermeer is managed by RUM in return for a management fee. We maintain majority voting control of Vermeer, while PGGM retains economic benefits. Vermeer is considered a VIE, as it has voting rights that are not proportional to its participating rights and we are the primary beneficiary. As a result, we consolidate Vermeer and all significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. The portion of Vermeer’s earnings owned by third parties is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests. We have not provided any financial or other support to Vermeer that we were not contractually required to provide.
Fibonacci Re
In 2016, Fibonacci Re, a Bermuda-domiciled SPI, was formed to provide collateralized capacity to Renaissance Reinsurance and its affiliates. Fibonacci Re raised capital from third party investors and us via private placements of participating notes that are listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange. This arrangement enables Renaissance Reinsurance to support its clients with additional property catastrophe reinsurance capacity and we believe it provides attractive risk-adjusted returns to our capital partners. We concluded that Fibonacci Re meets the definition of a VIE as it does not have sufficient equity capital to finance its activities. Therefore, we evaluated our relationship with Fibonacci Re and concluded we are not the primary beneficiary of Fibonacci Re as we do not have power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Fibonacci. As a result, we do not consolidate the financial position and results of operations of Fibonacci. Other than our investment in the participating notes of Fibonacci Re, we have not provided financial or other support to Fibonacci Re that we were not contractually required to provide.
Langhorne
Effective December 22, 2017, we closed an initiative with Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated to source third party capital to support reinsurers targeting large in-force life and annuity blocks. Langhorne Holdings is a company that owns and manages certain reinsurance entities within Langhorne. Langhorne Partners is the general partner for Langhorne and the entity which manages the third-party investors investing into Langhorne Holdings in return for a management and performance based incentive fee. We concluded that Langhorne Holdings meets the definition of a VIE. We are not the primary beneficiary of Langhorne Holdings and as a result, we do not consolidate the financial position or results of operations of Langhorne Holdings. We concluded that Langhorne Partners was not a VIE. We account for our 
11

investments in Langhorne Holdings and Langhorne Partners under the equity method of accounting, one quarter in arrears. We anticipate that our investment in Langhorne will increase, perhaps materially, as in-force life and annuity blocks of businesses are written. Other than our current and committed future equity investment in Langhorne, we have not provided financial or other support to Langhorne that we were not contractually required to provide.
Strategic Investments
Ventures also pursues strategic investments where, rather than assuming exclusive management responsibilities ourselves, we partner with other market participants. These investments may be directed at classes of risk other than catastrophe reinsurance, and at times may also be directed at non-insurance risks, such as Insurtech opportunities. We find these investments attractive because of their expected returns, and because they provide us with diversification benefits and information and exposure to other aspects of the market. For example, in 2018 we acquired a minority shareholding in Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd, a long-term consolidator in the non-life insurance/reinsurance run-off sector, which is accounted for at fair value and is included in other investments. Other examples of strategic investments include our investments in Bluegrass Insurance Management, LLC, Tower Hill Claims Service, LLC, Tower Hill Holdings, Inc., Tower Hill Insurance Group, LLC, Tower Hill Insurance Managers, LLC, Tower Hill Re Holdings, Inc., Tower Hill Select Insurance Holdings, Inc., Tower Hill Signature Insurance Holdings, Inc. and Tomoka Re Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the “Tower Hill Companies”), which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We also have investments in Essent Group Ltd. and Trupanion Inc., which are accounted for at fair value and are included in other investments. 
The carrying value of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet, individually or in the aggregate, may differ from the realized value we may ultimately attain, perhaps significantly so. For example, we believe that our investment in the Tower Hill Companies, which is recorded under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”), would attract a significantly higher valuation than what is currently recognized in our consolidated financial statements. However, under GAAP, we are prohibited from recording this investment at fair value. In addition, there is no liquid market for this investment.
Other Transactions
Ventures works on a range of other customized reinsurance and financing transactions. For example, we have participated in and continuously analyze other attractive opportunities in the market for insurance-linked securities and derivatives. We believe our products contain a number of customized features designed to fit the needs of our partners, as well as our risk management objectives.
Our ventures business unit activities that appear in our consolidated underwriting results, such as DaVinci and certain reinsurance transactions, are included in our Property and Casualty and Specialty segment results as appropriate; the results of our equity method investments, such as Top Layer Re, and other ventures are included in the Other category of our segment results.
NEW BUSINESS
From time to time we consider diversification into new ventures, either through organic growth, the formation of new joint ventures, or the acquisition of or the investment in other companies or books of business of other companies. This potential diversification includes opportunities to write targeted, additional classes of risk-exposed business, both directly for our own account and through new joint venture opportunities. We also regularly evaluate potential strategic opportunities we believe might utilize our skills, capabilities, proprietary technology and relationships to support possible expansion into further risk-related coverages, services and products. Generally, we focus on underwriting or trading risks where we believe reasonably sufficient data is available and our analytical abilities provide us with a competitive advantage, in order for us to seek to model estimated probabilities of losses and returns in respect of our then current portfolio of risks. 
We regularly review potential strategic transactions that might improve our portfolio of business, enhance or focus our strategies, expand our distribution or capabilities, or provide other benefits. In evaluating potential new ventures or investments, we generally seek an attractive estimated return on equity, the ability to develop or capitalize on a competitive advantage, and opportunities which we believe will not detract from 
12

our core operations. We believe that our ability to attract investment and operational opportunities is supported by our strong reputation and financial resources, and by the capabilities and track record of our ventures unit. 
COMPETITION
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we believe that competition is, in general, increasing and becoming more robust. Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries and/or affiliates of globally recognized insurance companies, reinsurance divisions of certain insurance companies, domestic and international underwriting operations, and a range of entities offering forms of risk transfer protection on a collateralized or other non-traditional basis. As our business evolves and the (re)insurance industry continues to experience consolidation, we expect our competitors to change as well.
We believe that our principal competitors include other companies active in the Bermuda market, currently including Allied World Assurance Company, AG, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXA XL, Axis Capital Holdings Limited, Chubb Limited, Everest Re Group, Ltd., Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited (“Fidelis”), Hamilton Re Ltd. (“Hamilton Re”), PartnerRe Ltd., Sompo International (formerly known as Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd.) and Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. (“Third Point”), as well as a growing number of private, unrated reinsurers offering predominately collateralized reinsurance. We also compete with certain Lloyd’s syndicates active in the London market, as well as with a number of other industry participants, such as American International Group, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Hannover Rückversicherung AG (“Hannover Re”), Ironshore Inc., Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft in München (“Munich Re”) and Swiss Re Ltd.
Hedge funds, pension funds and endowments, investment banks, investment managers (such as Nephila Capital Ltd.), exchanges and other capital market participants are increasingly active in the reinsurance market and the market for related risk, either through the formation of reinsurance companies (such as Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd., Aeolus Re Ltd., Fidelis, Hamilton Re, and Third Point) or through the use of other financial products, such as catastrophe bonds, other insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance investment funds. We expect competition from these sources to continue to increase. In addition, we continue to anticipate growth in financial products offered to the insurance market that are intended to compete with traditional reinsurance, such as exchange traded catastrophe options, insurance-linked securities, unrated privately held reinsurance companies providing collateralized or other non-traditional reinsurance, catastrophe-linked derivative agreements and other financial products. 
The tax policies of the countries where our customers operate, as well as government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds, also affect demand for reinsurance, sometimes significantly. Moreover, government-backed entities increasingly represent competition for the coverages we provide directly or for the business of our customers, reducing the potential amount of third party private protection our clients might need or desire.
UNDERWRITING AND ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
Underwriting
Our primary underwriting goal is to construct a portfolio of reinsurance and insurance contracts and other financial risks that maximizes our return on shareholders’ equity, subject to prudent risk constraints, and to generate long-term growth in tangible book value per common share plus the change in accumulated dividends. We assess each new (re)insurance contract on the basis of the expected incremental return relative to the incremental contribution to portfolio risk.
We have developed a proprietary, computer-based pricing and exposure management system, REMS©, which has analytic and modeling capabilities that help us to assess the risk and return of each incremental (re)insurance contract in relation to our overall portfolio of (re)insurance contracts. We believe that REMS© is a robust underwriting and risk management system that has been successfully integrated into our business processes and culture. In conjunction with pricing models that we run outside of REMS©, the REMS© framework encompasses and facilitates risk capture, analysis, correlation, portfolio aggregation and capital allocation within a single system for all of our natural hazards and non-natural hazards (re)insurance contracts. We continue to invest in and improve REMS©, incorporating our underwriting and 
13

modeling experience and adding proprietary software and a significant amount of new industry data. We continually strive to improve our analytical techniques for both natural hazard and non-natural hazard models in REMS© and while our experience is most developed for analyzing natural hazard catastrophe risks, we continue to invest in and evolve our capabilities for assessing non-natural hazard catastrophe risks. Over the last five years, we have continued to develop our casualty and specialty modeling tools and capabilities in line with our business needs. With the acquisition of Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd. (“Platinum”) and the expertise added since then, we believe our tools are now state of the art and fully embedded in our underwriting processes.
We generally utilize a multiple model approach when evaluating a proposed transaction, combining both probabilistic and deterministic techniques. We combine the analyses generated by REMS© with other information and other model inputs available to us, including our own knowledge of the client submitting the proposed program, to assess the premium offered against the risk of loss and the cost of utilized capital which the program presents. The underlying risk models integrated into our underwriting and REMS© framework are a combination of internally constructed and commercially available models. We use commercially available natural hazard catastrophe models to assist with validating and stress testing our base model and REMS© results. 
Before we bind a (re)insurance risk, exposure data, historical loss information and other risk data is gathered from customers. Using a combination of proprietary software, underwriting experience, actuarial techniques and engineering expertise, as we deem appropriate, the exposure data is reviewed and augmented. We use this data as primary inputs into the REMS© modeling system as a base to create risk distributions to represent the risk being evaluated. We believe that the REMS© modeling system helps us to analyze each policy on a consistent basis, assisting our determination of what we believe to be an appropriate price to charge for each policy based upon the risk to be assumed. In part, through the process described above and the utilization of REMS©, we seek to compare our estimate of the expected returns in respect of a contract with the amount of capital we notionally allocate to the contract based on our estimate of its marginal impact on our portfolio of risks. A key advantage of our REMS© framework is our ability to include additional perils, risks and geographic areas that may not be captured in commercially available natural hazards risk models.
We periodically review the estimates and assumptions that are reflected in REMS© and our other tools, driven either by new hazard science and understanding or by experience of loss events. For example, the movement in cedant loss estimates seen across the market in the months following Hurricane Irma prompted us to perform, in conjunction with several partner companies, a detailed review of the nature of the claims made as a result of that event. In addition, we have reviewed the prevalence of “assignment of benefits”, or “AOB” activity in underlying claims as well as the impact of loss adjusting expenses and the costs associated with any litigation. This process is informing a change in our view of reinsurance risk in certain parts of the state of Florida based on the observed behavioral norms. More generally our team of scientists at Weather Predict Consulting Inc. (“Weather Predict”) have been tracking the impact of climate and expanding urban development in both tornado/hail and wildfire risk over the last several years. The recent history of California wildfire events, and particularly the extreme outbreaks during 2017 and 2018, are being used to validate, and where necessary inform, our representation of this risk.
Our underwriters use the combination of our risk assessment and underwriting process, REMS© and other tools in their pricing decisions, which we believe provides them with several competitive advantages. These include the ability to:

• | simulate a range of potential outcomes that adequately represents the risk to an individual contract;


• | analyze the incremental impact of an individual reinsurance contract on our overall portfolio;


• | better assess the underlying exposures associated with assumed retrocessional business;


• | price contracts within a short time frame;


• | capture various classes of risk, including catastrophe and other insurance risks;


• | assess risk across multiple entities (including our various joint ventures) and across different components of our capital structure; and


• | provide consistent pricing information.

14

As part of our risk management process, we also use REMS© to assist us, as a retrocedant, with the purchase of reinsurance coverage for our own account.
Our underwriting and risk management process, in conjunction with REMS©, quantifies and manages our exposure to claims from single events and the exposure to losses from a series of events. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we also assess a variety of other factors, including:

• | the reputation of the proposed cedant and the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the cedant;


• | the geographic area in which the cedant does business and its market share;


• | historical loss data for the cedant and, where available, for the industry as a whole in the relevant regions and lines of business, in order to compare the cedant’s historical catastrophe loss experience to industry averages;


• | the cedant’s pricing strategies; and


• | the perceived financial strength of the cedant and factors such as the cedant’s historical record of making premium payments in full and on a timely basis.

In order to estimate the risk profile of each line of non-natural hazard reinsurance (i.e., our casualty and specialty lines of business), we establish probability distributions and assess the correlations with the rest of our portfolio. In lines with catastrophe risk, such as excess workers’ compensation and terrorism, we seek to directly leverage our skill in modeling property reinsurance risks, and seek to appropriately estimate and manage the correlations between these casualty and specialty lines and our property reinsurance portfolio. For other classes of business, in which we believe we have little or no natural catastrophe exposure, and therefore less correlation with our property reinsurance coverages, we derive probability distributions from a variety of underlying information sources, including recent historical experience, and the application of judgment as appropriate. The nature of some of these businesses lends itself less to the analysis we use for our property reinsurance coverages, reflecting both the nature of available exposure information, and the impact of human factors such as tort exposure. We produce probability distributions to represent our estimates of the related underlying risks which our products cover, which we believe helps us to make consistent underwriting decisions and to manage our total risk portfolio.
In addition, we also produce, utilize and report on models which measure our utilization of capital in light of regulatory capital considerations and constraints. Our position in respect of these regulatory capital models is reviewed by our risk management professional staff and periodically reported to and reviewed by senior underwriting personnel and executive management with responsibility for our regulated operating entities. 
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”)
We believe that high-quality and effective ERM is best achieved when it is a shared cultural value throughout the organization and consider ERM to be a key process which is the responsibility of every individual within the Company. We have developed and utilize tools and processes we believe support a culture of risk management and create a robust framework of ERM within our organization. We believe that our ERM processes and practices help us to identify potential events that may affect us, quantify, evaluate and manage the risks to which we are exposed, and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of our objectives. We believe that effective ERM can provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that effective ERM assists our efforts to minimize the likelihood of suffering financial outcomes in excess of the ranges which we have estimated in respect of specific investments, underwriting decisions, or other operating or business activities, although we do not believe this risk can be eliminated. We believe that our risk management tools support our strategy of pursuing opportunities and help us to identify opportunities we believe to be the most attractive. In particular, we utilize our risk management tools to support our efforts to monitor our capital position, on a consolidated basis and for each of our major operating subsidiaries, and to allocate an appropriate amount of capital to support the risks we have assumed in the aggregate and for each of our major operating subsidiaries. We believe that our risk management efforts are essential to our corporate strategy and our goal of achieving long-term growth in tangible book value per share plus the change in accumulated dividends for our shareholders.
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing enterprise-wide risk management and is actively involved in the monitoring of risks that could affect us. The members of the Board have regular, direct 
15

access to the senior executives and other officers responsible for identifying and monitoring our risks and coordinating our ERM, including our Group Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Group General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, each of whom reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, as well as other senior personnel such as our Chief Accounting Officer, Global Corporate Controller and Head of Internal Audit. The Board also receives regular reports from the Controls and Compliance Committee described below.
Our ERM framework operates via a three lines of defense model. The first line of defense consists of individual functions that deliberately assume risks on our behalf and own and manage risk within the Company on a day-to-day and business operational basis. The second line of defense is responsible for risk oversight and also supports the first line to understand and manage risk. A dedicated risk team led by the Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible for this second line and reports to the Board of Director’s Investment and Risk Management Committee and the Chief Executive Officer. The third line of defense, our Internal Audit team, reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and provides independent, objective assurance as to the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control systems and also coordinates risk-based audits and compliance reviews and other specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business. 
The principal risk areas that make up our ERM framework are assumed risk (including reserve risk), business environment risk and operational risk:

• | Assumed Risk. We define assumed risk as activities where we deliberately take risk against our capital base, including underwriting risks and other quantifiable risks such as credit risk and market risk as they relate to investments, ceded reinsurance credit risk and strategic investment risk, each of which can be analyzed in substantial part through quantitative tools and techniques. Of these, we believe underwriting risk to be the most material to us. In order to understand, monitor, quantify and proactively assess underwriting risk, we seek to develop and deploy appropriate tools to estimate the comparable expected returns on potential business opportunities and the impact that such incremental business could have on our overall risk profile. We use the tools and methods described above in “Underwriting” to seek to achieve these objectives. Embedded within our consideration of assumed risk is our management of our aggregate, consolidated risk profile. In part through the utilization of REMS© and our other systems and procedures, we analyze our in-force aggregate assumed risk portfolio on a daily basis. We believe this capability helps us to manage our aggregate exposures and to rigorously analyze and evaluate individual proposed transactions in the context of our in-force portfolio. This aggregation process captures line of business, segment and corporate risk profiles, calculates internal and external capital tests and explicitly models ceded reinsurance. Generally, additional data is added quarterly to our aggregate risk framework to reflect updated or new information or estimates relating to matters such as interest rate risk, credit risk, capital adequacy and liquidity. This information is used in day-to-day decision making for underwriting, investments and operations and is also reviewed quarterly from both a unit level and consolidated financial position perspective. We also regularly assess, monitor and review our regulatory risk capital and related constraints.

Reserve Risk. Reserve risk is a subcomponent of assumed risk. We define reserve risk as the risks related to our reserve for net claims and claim expenses, including the amount, both absolute and relative, of our outstanding reserve for net claims and claim expenses, and the impact of economic, social, legal and regulatory matters. Our reserve for net claims and claim expenses is subject to significant uncertainty and has the potential to develop adversely in future periods. While reserve risk may increase in both absolute terms and relative to its overall consideration in our ERM framework, we employ robust resources, procedures and technology to identify, understand, quantify and manage this risk. Our reserving methodologies and sensitivities for each respective line of business described in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates, Claims and Claim Expense Reserves.” 

• | Business Environment Risk. We define business environment risk as the risk of changes in the business, political or regulatory environment that could negatively impact our short term or long-term financial results or the markets in which we operate. This risk area also typically includes emerging risks. These risks are predominately extrinsic to us and our ability to alter or eliminate

16

these risks is limited, so we focus our efforts on monitoring developments, assessing potential impacts of any changes, and investing in cost effective means to attempt to mitigate the consequences of and ensure compliance with any new requirements applicable to us.

• | Operational Risk. We are subject to a number of additional risks arising out of operational, regulatory, and other matters. We define operational risk to include the risk we fail to create, manage, control or mitigate the people, processes, structures or functions required to execute our strategic and tactical plans and assemble an optimized portfolio of assumed risk, and to adjust to and comply with the evolving requirements of business environment risk applicable to us. In light of the rapid evolution of our markets, business environment, and business initiatives, we seek to continually invest in the tools, processes and procedures we use to mitigate our exposure to operational risk on a cost-effective basis. As with assumed risk and business environment risk, operational risk presents intrinsic uncertainties, and we may fail to appropriately identify or mitigate applicable operational risk.

Controls and Compliance Committee.  We believe that a key component of our current operational risk management platform is our Controls and Compliance Committee. The Controls and Compliance Committee is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Global Corporate Controller, Group Chief Risk Officer, Head of Internal Audit, staff compliance professionals and representatives from our business units. The purpose of the Controls and Compliance Committee is to establish, assess the effectiveness of, and enforce policies, procedures and practices relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, regulatory, legal, compliance and related matters, and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Code of Ethics and Conduct (the “Code of Ethics”), and other relevant standards. In addition, the Controls and Compliance Committee is charged with reviewing certain transactions that potentially raise complex and/or significant tax, legal, accounting, regulatory, financial reporting, reputational or compliance issues.
In addition, we address other areas of operational risk through our disaster recovery program, human resource practices such as motivating and retaining top talent, our strict tax protocols and our legal and regulatory policies and procedures. 
Ongoing Development and Enhancement.  We seek to reflect and categorize risks we monitor in part through quantitative risk distributions, even where we believe that such quantitative analysis is not as robust or well developed as our tools and models for measuring and evaluating other risks, such as catastrophe and market risks. We also seek to improve the methods by which we measure risks and believe effective risk management is a continual process that requires ongoing improvement and development. We seek from time to time to identify effective new practices or additional developments both from within our industry and from other sectors. We believe that our ongoing efforts to embed ERM throughout our organization help us produce and maintain a competitive advantage and achieve our corporate goals.
RATINGS
Financial strength ratings are an important factor in evaluating and establishing the competitive position of reinsurance and insurance companies. We have received high claims-paying and financial strength ratings from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), Standard and Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (“Fitch”). These ratings represent independent opinions of an insurer’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet policyholder obligations, and are not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures and ratings may be revised or revoked by the agencies which issue them. 
In addition, S&P and A.M. Best assess companies’ ERM practices, which is an opinion on the many critical dimensions of risk that determine overall creditworthiness. RenaissanceRe has been assigned an ERM rating of “Very Strong” from each of these agencies, which is the highest ERM score assigned. 
See “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Capital Resources, Ratings” for the ratings of our principal operating subsidiaries and joint ventures by segment, and details of recent ratings actions. 
17

RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM EXPENSES
We believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of claims and claim expense reserves. Claims and claim expense reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for unpaid claims and claim expenses arising from the insurance and reinsurance contracts we sell. We establish our claims and claim expense reserves by taking claims reported to us by insureds and ceding companies, but which have not yet been paid (“case reserves”), adding estimates for the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us, or incurred but not enough reported to us (collectively referred to as “IBNR”) and, if deemed necessary, adding costs for additional case reserves which represent our estimates for claims related to specific contracts which we believe may not be adequately estimated by the client as of that date, or adequately covered in the application of IBNR.
Our reserving techniques, assumptions and processes differ among our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. Refer to “Note 7. Reserve for Claims and Claim Expenses in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” for more information on the risks we insure and reinsure, the reserving techniques, assumptions and processes we follow to estimate our claims and claim expense reserves, prior year development of the reserve for claims and claim expenses, analysis of our incurred and paid claims development and claims duration information for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments. In addition, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates, Claims and Claim Expense Reserves” for more information on our current estimates versus our initial estimates of our claims reserves, and sensitivity analysis for each of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments.
INVESTMENTS
Our investment guidelines stress preservation of capital, market liquidity, and diversification of risk. The majority of our investments consist of highly rated fixed income securities. We also hold a significant amount of short term investments which are managed as part of our investment portfolio and have a maturity of one year or less when purchased. In addition, we have an allocation to other investments including private equity investments, catastrophe bonds, senior secured bank loan funds and hedge funds, and to certain equity securities. We may from time to time re-evaluate our investment guidelines and explore investment allocations to other asset classes. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. 
For additional information regarding our investment portfolio, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, Investments” and “Note 4. Investments in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.
MARKETING
We believe that our modeling and technical expertise, the risk management products we provide to our customers, and our reputation for paying claims promptly has enabled us to become a provider of first choice in many lines of business to our customers worldwide. We market our products primarily through reinsurance brokers and we focus our marketing efforts on targeted brokers and partners. We believe that our existing portfolio of business is a valuable asset and, therefore, we attempt to continually strengthen relationships with our existing brokers and customers. We believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers, we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential reinsureds. We target prospects that are capable of supplying detailed and accurate underwriting data and that potentially add further diversification to our book of business.
We believe that primary insurers’ and brokers’ willingness to use a particular reinsurer is based not just on pricing, but also on the financial security of the reinsurer, its claim paying ability ratings and demonstrated willingness to promptly pay valid claims, the quality of a reinsurer’s service, the reinsurer’s willingness and ability to design customized programs, its long-term stability and its commitment to provide stable reinsurance capacity across market cycles. We believe we have established a reputation with our brokers and customers for prompt response on underwriting submissions, for fast payments on valid claims and for providing creative solutions to our customers’ needs. 
18

Our portfolio of business continues to be characterized by relatively large transactions with ceding companies with whom we do business, although no current relationship exceeds 10% of our gross premiums written. Accordingly, our gross premiums written are subject to significant fluctuations depending on our success in maintaining or expanding our relationships with these customers. We believe that our willingness and ability to design customized programs and to provide bespoke risk management products has helped us to develop long-term relationships with brokers and customers.
Our brokers assess client needs and also perform data collection, contract preparation and other administrative tasks, enabling us to market our products cost effectively by maintaining a smaller staff. In recent years, our distribution has become increasingly reliant on a small and relatively decreasing number of broker relationships reflecting consolidation in the broker sector. We expect this concentration to continue and perhaps increase. In 2018, three brokerage firms accounted for 75.2% of our gross premiums written.
The following table shows the percentage of our Property and Casualty and Specialty segments’ gross premiums written generated through subsidiaries and affiliates of our largest brokers:

Year ended December 31, 2018 | Property | | Casualty and Specialty | | Total
AON | 42.7 | % | | 38.4 | % | 40.7 | %
Marsh | 29.1 | % | | 19.5 | % | 24.6 | %
Willis Towers Watson | 7.2 | % | | 12.9 | % | 9.9 | %
Total of largest brokers | 79.0 | % | | 70.8 | % | 75.2 | %
All others | 21.0 | % | | 29.2 | % | 24.8 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

EMPLOYEES
At February 4, 2019, we employed 411 people worldwide (February 2, 2018 - 384, February 17, 2017 - 376). Our overall headcount is expected to increase as a result of the TMR Stock Purchase. 
None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements at any of our subsidiaries.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Our business and support functions utilize information systems that provide critical services to both our employees and our customers. We have an integrated team of professionals who manage and support our communication platforms, transaction-management systems, and analytics and reporting capabilities, including the development of proprietary solutions like REMS©. We use off-site, secure data centers in North America and Europe for most of our core applications, but our use of cloud-based services is increasing as the security and reliability of these services improves.
Information security and privacy are important concerns, with an escalating cyber-threat environment and evolving regulatory requirements driving continued investment in this area. Our information security program is designed around the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) cybersecurity framework, upon which many cybersecurity regulations are modeled. In 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services’ Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (the “NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation”), which sets minimum cybersecurity standards for financial institutions, insurers and certain other companies supervised by the NYDFS and to which we are subject, became effective. In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (the “NAIC”) adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which closely resembles the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation and will be considered by states for adoption. These and other cybersecurity regulations impose significant new regulatory requirements intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems. Our program is designed to comply with all applicable cybersecurity regulatory requirements and we continue to evaluate and assess our compliance in the changing regulatory environment.
We protect our information systems with physical, electronic and software safeguards considered appropriate by our management. In addition, we perform regular security penetration test scenarios and provide regular security risk staff education awareness sessions in order to evaluate our preparedness and 
19

to enhance both our system’s and our users’ ability to identify, protect from, detect, respond to and recover from such an incident. Despite these efforts, computer viruses, hackers, employee misuse or misconduct and other internal or external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions.
We have implemented disaster recovery and business continuity plans for our operations which are regularly tested with respect to our business-critical infrastructure and systems. We employ data backup procedures that seek to ensure that our key business systems and data are regularly backed up, and can be restored promptly if and as needed. In addition, we generally store backup information at off-site locations, in order to seek to minimize our risk of loss of key data in the event of a disaster. Our recovery plans involve arrangements with our off-site, secure data centers. We believe we will be able to access our systems from these facilities and remotely in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to various scenarios, such as natural disasters.
REGULATION
The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries and all states in the U.S., although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another.  Currently, we operate primarily in Bermuda, the U.S. and the U.K. We also have operations in Singapore, Ireland and Switzerland. Although principally regulated by the regulatory authorities of their respective jurisdictions, our operating subsidiaries may also be subject to regulation in the jurisdictions of their ceding companies. In addition, expansion into additional insurance markets could expose us or our subsidiaries to increasing regulatory oversight. However, we intend to continue to conduct our operations so as to minimize the likelihood that Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci, Top Layer Re, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S., Upsilon RFO, or any of our other Bermudian subsidiaries will become subject to direct U.S. regulation. Upon completion of the TMR Stock Purchase, we will become subject to increased regulation in various jurisdictions, including the U.K., Switzerland and the U.S., including the insurance holding company laws of New York, the domestic state of Tokio Millennium Re AG (US Branch), a United States branch of Tokio Millennium Re AG.  
Bermuda Regulation
All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981. In addition, the Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations (collectively, the “Insurance Act”), regulate the business of our Bermuda insurance, reinsurance and management company subsidiaries.
As a holding company, RenaissanceRe is not currently subject to the Insurance Act. However, the Insurance Act regulates the insurance and reinsurance business of our Bermuda-licensed operating insurance companies. RenaissanceRe’s Bermuda-licensed operating insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures include Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci, which are registered as Class 4 general business insurers, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. and Vermeer, which are registered as Class 3B general business insurers, and Top Layer Re, which is registered as a Class 3A general business insurer under the Insurance Act. RenaissanceRe also has operating subsidiaries registered as SPIs under the Insurance Act, including Upsilon RFO. RUM and RenaissanceRe Underwriting Management Ltd. are each registered as insurance managers under the Insurance Act.
The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements and confers on the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.
On March 24, 2016, the BMA was recognized by the European Parliament as fully equivalent under Solvency II for its commercial (re)insurers, retroactive to January 1, 2016. To achieve this status, the BMA made certain changes to the filing requirements and public disclosure requirements applicable to commercial (re)insurers and insurance groups, including amendments to the statutory financial reporting regime, aligning it with GAAP, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or other acceptable accounting standards, and the introduction of an economic balance sheet (“EBS”) framework. Amendments were made to the Insurance Act to meet these changing requirements.
20

General Purpose Financial Statements. All Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must prepare financial statements in respect of their insurance business in accordance with GAAP, IFRS or other acceptable accounting standards, which are published on the BMA website.
Statutory Financial Statements. Each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 general business insurer is required to submit annual statutory financial statements as part of its statutory financial return no later than four months after the insurer’s financial year end (unless specifically extended). The GAAP or IFRS financial statements are the basis on which statutory financial statements are prepared, subject to the application of certain prudential filters as outlined in the Insurance Accounts Rules 2016. The statutory financial statements contain statements both on a consolidated and unconsolidated basis. The unconsolidated information forms the basis for assessing the insurer’s liquidity position, minimum solvency margin and class of registration.
Capital and Solvency Return. Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers are also required to file a capital and solvency return in respect of their general business, which includes, among other items, the EBS, a schedule of governance and risk management, a catastrophe risk return, a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves, a schedule of eligible capital and the Enhanced Capital Requirement (“ECR”) as calculated by the Bermuda Solvency and Capital Requirement (“BSCR”) model. The consolidated information within the statutory financial statements form the starting basis for the preparation of the EBS. The EBS is, in turn, used as the basis to calculate the insurer’s ECR.
Financial Condition Report. Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and publish a financial condition report (“FCR”), which was introduced to the regulatory regime in 2016 as part of the measures undertaken to achieve Solvency II equivalence. The FCR provides, among other things, details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework and solvency and financial performance of the insurer/insurance group.
Minimum Solvency Margin. A general business insurer’s statutory assets must exceed its statutory liabilities by an amount, equal to or greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin (“Minimum Solvency Margin”), which varies with the category of its registration. The Minimum Solvency Margin that must be maintained by a Class 4 insurer is the greater of (i) $100.0 million, (ii) 50% of net premiums written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums), (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the ECR, which is established by reference to the BSCR model. The Minimum Solvency Margin for a Class 3A or Class 3B insurer is the greater of (i) $1.0 million, (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net premiums written; if in excess of $6.0 million, the figure is $1.2 million plus 15% of net premiums written in excess of $6.0 million, (iii) 15% of net aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the insurer’s ECR.
Enhanced Capital Requirement. Each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer is required to maintain its statutory economic capital and surplus at a level at least equal to its ECR which is established by reference to either the BSCR or an approved internal capital model. In either case, the ECR shall at all times equal or exceed the respective Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer’s Minimum Solvency Margin and may be adjusted in circumstances where the BMA concludes that the insurer’s risk profile deviates significantly from the assumptions underlying its ECR or the insurer’s assessment of its risk management policies and practices used to calculate the ECR applicable to it. While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level (“TCL”) for each Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of the respective ECR. While a Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory economic capital and surplus at this level, the TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased BMA regulatory oversight.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio. An insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities (“Minimum Liquidity Ratio”).
Eligible Capital. To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of an insurer’s capital resources, Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must maintain available capital in accordance with a “three tiered capital system”. All capital instruments are classified as either basic or ancillary capital, which in turn are classified into one of three tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3) based on their "loss absorbency" characteristics (the "Tiered Capital Requirements"). Eligibility limits are then applied to each tier in determining the amounts eligible to cover regulatory capital requirement levels. The highest capital is classified as Tier 1 capital and lesser 
21

quality capital is classified as either Tier 2 capital or Tier 3 capital. Under this regime, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used to satisfy the Class 3A, 3B and 4 insurers' Minimum Solvency Margin and ECR requirements.
Restrictions on Dividends, Distributions and Reductions of Capital. Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends if in breach of the required Minimum Solvency Margin or Minimum Liquidity Ratio (the “Relevant Margins”) or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause the insurer to fail to meet the Relevant Margins. Further, Class 3A, 3B and Class 4 insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet its Relevant Margins. Class 3A, Class 3B and Class 4 insurers must obtain the BMA’s prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year’s financial statements. These restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the Insurance Act are in addition to the solvency requirements under the Companies Act which apply to all Bermuda companies.
Fit and Proper Controllers. The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers (as defined herein) of all Bermuda registered insurers. For so long as shares of RenaissanceRe are listed on the NYSE or another recognized stock exchange, the Insurance Act requires that the BMA be notified in writing within 45 days of any person becoming, or ceasing to be, a controller. A controller includes the managing director or chief executive of the registered insurer or its parent company; a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller; and any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act. In addition, all Bermuda insurers are also required to give the BMA written notice of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer includes a director, secretary, chief executive or senior executive by whatever name called.
Material Change. All registered insurers are required to give the BMA 30 days’ notice of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act, and shall not take any steps to give effect to a material change unless, before the end of notice period unless they have been notified by the BMA in writing that it has no objection to such change or the period has lapsed without the BMA issuing a notice of objection.
certain matters that are likely to be of material significance to the BMA in carrying out its supervisory function under the Insurance Act. The Insurance Act prescribes which matters require advance notice.
Insurance Code of Conduct. All Bermuda insurers are required to comply with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct, which establishes duties, requirements and standards to be complied with to ensure each insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Failure to comply with these requirements will be a factor taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner under the Insurance Act and in calculating the operational risk charge applicable in accordance with the insurer's BSCR model or approved internal model.
Special Purpose Insurer Reporting Requirements. Unlike other (re)insurers, SPIs are fully funded to meet their (re)insurance obligations; therefore the application and supervision processes are streamlined to facilitate the transparent structure. Further, the BMA has the discretion to modify such insurer’s accounting requirements under the Insurance Act. Like other (re)insurers, the principal representative of an SPI has a duty to inform the BMA in relation to solvency matters, where applicable. During 2016, new legislative requirements were introduced requiring SPIs to file annual statutory or modified financial returns via an electronic filing system. Under these requirements, SPIs are required to map GAAP financial statements to the electronic statutory forms and are required to provide information around ownership structure, assessment of risks, analyses of premium and details of segregated cells.
Insurance Manager Reporting Requirements. During 2016, the BMA undertook to enhance its oversight of insurance managers as part of the development of Bermuda’s insurance regulatory framework. As part of this, the BMA introduced the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct and required insurance managers to file specific details via an Insurance Manager’s Return. The Insurance Manager’s Return requires, among other things, details around directors and officers of the insurance manager, the services provided by the entity, and details of the insurers managed by the insurance manager.
22

Group Supervision. Pursuant to the Insurance Act, the BMA acts as the group supervisor of the RenaissanceRe group of companies (the “RenaissanceRe Group”) and it has designated Renaissance Reinsurance to be the “designated insurer” in respect of the RenaissanceRe Group. The designated insurer is required to ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group complies with the provisions of the Insurance Act pertaining to groups and all related group solvency and group supervision rules (together, the “Group Rules”). Under the Group Rules, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to annually prepare and submit to the BMA group GAAP financial statements, group statutory financial statements, a group capital and solvency return (including an EBS) and an FCR. An insurance group must ensure that the value of the insurance group's assets exceeds the amount of the insurance group's liabilities by the aggregate of: (i) the individual Minimum Solvency Margin of each qualifying member of the group controlled by the parent company; and (ii) the parent company’s percentage shareholding in the member multiplied by the member’s Minimum Solvency Margin, where the parent company exercises significant influence over a member of the group but does not control the member (the "Group Minimum Solvency Margin"). A member is a qualified member of the insurance group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. Every insurance group is also required to submit an annual group actuarial opinion when filing its group capital and solvency return. The group is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be the group actuary. The group actuary must provide an opinion on the RenaissanceRe Group’s technical provisions as recorded in the RenaissanceRe Group statutory EBS. Insurance groups are required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the value of its group ECR, which is calculated at the end of its relevant year by reference to the BSCR model of the group (the “Group BSCR”) or an approved internal capital model provided that the group ECR shall at all times be an amount equal to or exceeding the Group Minimum Solvency Margin. The BMA expects insurance groups to operate at or above a group TCL, which exceeds the group ECR. The TCL for insurance groups is set at 120% of its group ECR. In addition, under the Tiered Capital Requirements described above, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital may be used by an insurance group to satisfy the Group's Minimum Solvency Margin and group ECR requirements. Further, our Board of Directors has established solvency self assessment procedures for the RenaissanceRe Group that factor in all foreseeable material risks; Renaissance Reinsurance must ensure that the RenaissanceRe Group’s assets exceed the amount of the RenaissanceRe Group’s liabilities by the aggregate minimum margin of solvency of each qualifying member; and our Board of Directors has established and implements corporate governance policies and procedures designed to ensure they support the overall organizational strategy of the RenaissanceRe Group. In addition, the RenaissanceRe Group is required to prepare and submit to the BMA a quarterly financial return comprising unaudited consolidated group financial statements, a schedule of intra-group transactions and a schedule of risk concentrations.
The BMA has certain powers of investigation and intervention relating to insurers and their holding companies, subsidiaries and other affiliates, which it may exercise in the interest of such insurer’s policyholders or if there is any risk of insolvency or of a breach of the Insurance Act or the insurer’s license conditions. The BMA may cancel an insurer’s registration on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act.
Under the provisions of the Insurance Act, the BMA may, from time to time, conduct “on site” visits at the offices of insurers it regulates. Over the past several years, the BMA has conducted “on site” reviews in respect of our Bermuda-domiciled operating insurers.
Economic Substance Act. In December 2018, the Economic Substance Act 2018 (the “ESA”) came into effect in Bermuda. Under the provisions of the ESA, every Bermuda registered entity engaged in a “relevant activity” must satisfy economic substance requirements by maintaining a substantial economic presence in Bermuda. Under the ESA, insurance or holding entity activities (both as defined in the ESA and Economic Substance Regulations 2018) are relevant activities. To the extent that the ESA applies to any of our entities registered in Bermuda, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with economic substance requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda. 
Income Taxes. Currently, neither we nor our shareholders are required to pay Bermuda income or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax in respect of our shares.  We have obtained an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 that, if Bermuda enacts legislation imposing any tax on profits, income, capital asset, gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax 
23

shall not be applicable to us, our operations or our shares, debentures or other obligations until March 31, 2035, except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in Bermuda.
U.S. Regulation
Admitted Company Regulation. Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is a Maryland-domiciled insurer licensed in 26 states and the District of Columbia and qualified or certified as a reinsurer in an additional 24 states. As a U.S. licensed and authorized insurer, Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. is subject to considerable regulation and supervision by state insurance regulators. The extent of regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state. Among other things, state insurance departments regulate insurer solvency, authorized investments, loss and loss adjustment expense and unearned premium reserves, and deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders. State insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of authorized insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of companies and other matters. The Maryland Insurance Administration, as Renaissance Reinsurance U.S.’s domestic regulator, is the primary financial regulator of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. We are pursuing growth in many lines of business written by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., which may increase the impact of U.S. regulation on our business as a whole.
Holding Company Regulation. We are subject to the insurance holding company laws of Maryland, the domestic state of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. These laws generally require Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to file certain reports concerning its capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations with the Maryland Insurance Administration. Generally, all affiliate transactions involving Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. must be fair and, if material or of specified types, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the Maryland Insurance Administration. Further, Maryland law places limitations on the amounts of dividends or distributions payable by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. Payment of ordinary dividends by Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. requires notice to the Maryland Insurance Administration. Declaration of an extraordinary dividend, which must be paid out of earned surplus, generally requires thirty days’ prior notice to and approval or non-disapproval of the Maryland Insurance Administration. An extraordinary dividend includes any dividend whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (1) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year or (2) the insurer’s net investment income, excluding realized capital gains (as determined under statutory accounting principles), for the twelve month period ending December 31 of the preceding year and pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer’s own securities, plus any amounts of net investment income (subject to the foregoing exclusions), in the three calendar years prior to the preceding year which have not been distributed.
Maryland law also requires any person seeking to acquire control of a Maryland-domestic insurer or of an entity that directly or indirectly controls a Maryland-domestic insurer, including its holding company, to file a statement with the Maryland Insurance Administration at least 60 days before the proposed acquisition of control. The transaction seeking to acquire control cannot be made unless, within 60 days after the statement is filed with the Maryland Insurance Administration, or within any extension of that period, the Maryland Insurance Administration approves, or does not disapprove, the transaction. Any purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurance company, its holding company or any other entity directly or indirectly controlling the insurance company is presumed to have acquired control, unless the presumption is rebutted. Therefore, any investor who intends to acquire 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s outstanding voting securities may need to comply with these laws and would be required to file statements and reports with the Maryland Insurance Administration before such acquisition.
Effective for 2014, Maryland adopted enterprise risk management and reporting obligations applicable to insurance holding company systems that are meant to protect the licensed companies from enterprise risk. These obligations include requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the U.S. licensed companies. We timely filed our enterprise risk reports with the Maryland Insurance Administration for 2017 and 2018.
24

Effective for 2018, Maryland adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Act (the “RMORSA Act”) based on the NAIC Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act. The RMORSA Act requires Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. to: (i) maintain a risk management framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting its material and relevant risks; (ii) complete an Own Risk Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) at least once each year and at any time there is a significant change to the risk profile of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. or its holding company system; and (iii) submit an ORSA summary report to the Maryland Insurance Administration at least once each year. The obligation to maintain a risk management framework may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe group maintains a risk management framework that applies to the operations of Renaissance Reinsurance U.S. and the ORSA obligation may be satisfied if the RenaissanceRe group completes an ORSA in accordance with the requirements of the RMORSA Act.
Reinsurance Regulation. The insurance laws of each U.S. state regulate the sale of reinsurance to licensed ceding insurers by non-admitted alien reinsurers acting from locations outside the state. With some exceptions, the sale of insurance within a jurisdiction where the insurer is not admitted to do business is prohibited. Our Bermuda-domiciled insurance operations and joint ventures (principally Renaissance Reinsurance, DaVinci, Top Layer Re, RenaissanceRe Specialty U.S. and Upsilon RFO) are all admitted to transact insurance business in Bermuda and do not maintain an office or solicit, advertise, settle claims or conduct other insurance activities in any other jurisdiction where the conduct of such activities would require that any company be so admitted.
RenaissanceRe Underwriting Managers U.S. LLC is licensed by the Connecticut Department of Insurance as a reinsurance intermediary broker and is required to maintain its reinsurance intermediary broker license in force in order to conduct its reinsurance operations in Connecticut.
Although reinsurance contract terms and rates are generally not subject to regulation by state insurance authorities, a primary U.S. insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit on its statutory financial statements for the reinsurance ceded. State insurance regulators permit U.S. ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted, non-U.S. (alien) reinsurers if the reinsurance contract contains certain minimum provisions and if the reinsurance obligations of the non-U.S. reinsurer are appropriately collateralized. Qualifying collateral may be established by an alien reinsurer exclusively for a single U.S. ceding company. Alternatively, an alien reinsurer that is accredited by a state may establish a multi-beneficiary trust with qualifying assets equal to its reinsurance obligations to all U.S. ceding insurers, plus a trusteed surplus amount. Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci are each an accredited reinsurer in New York and Florida and have established multi-beneficiary trusts with a qualifying financial institution in New York for the benefit of their U.S. cedants.
States generally require non-admitted alien reinsurers to provide collateral equal to one hundred percent of their reinsurance obligations to U.S. ceding insurers in order for the U.S. ceding insurers to obtain full credit for reinsurance. However, most states have adopted credit for reinsurance laws and regulations based on NAIC model law and regulation amendments that permit U.S. ceding insurers to take full credit for reinsurance when a “certified” reinsurer posts reduced collateral amounts. U.S. states are required to adopt the NAIC model law and regulation amendments permitting reduced collateral for certified reinsurers as an NAIC accreditation requirement by January 1, 2019. Under these credit for reinsurance laws and regulations, qualifying alien reinsurers may reduce their collateral for future reinsurance agreements based on a secure rating assigned by the U.S. insurance regulator. The secure rating is assigned by the state upon an assessment of the reinsurer’s financial condition, financial strength ratings and other factors. In addition, the alien reinsurer must be domiciled in a jurisdiction that is “qualified” under state law. The NAIC granted conditional qualified jurisdiction status to Bermuda effective January 1, 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, the NAIC approved its initial list of qualified jurisdictions, including Bermuda, and states that have these credit for reinsurance laws and regulations may accept such qualification in assessing reinsurers for certification. Florida has approved Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci for collateral reduction. As noted below, EU-domiciled reinsurers will be subject to the provisions of the US-EU Covered Agreement (defined below) that require states to remove reinsurance collateral requirements for qualifying EU reinsurers as of the US-EU Covered Agreement’s implementation date.
NAIC Ratios. The NAIC has established 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of licensed property and casualty insurance companies operating in their respective states. The NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) calculates these ratios 
25

based on information submitted by insurers on an annual basis and shares the information with the applicable state insurance departments. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results and assists state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. An insurance company may fall outside of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are themselves immaterial. 
Federal Oversight and Other Government Intervention. Government intervention in the insurance and reinsurance markets in the U.S. continues to evolve. Although U.S. state regulation is currently the primary form of regulation of insurance and reinsurance, Congress has considered proposals in several areas that may impact the industry, including the creation of an optional federal charter and repeal of the insurance company antitrust exemption from the McCarran Ferguson Act. We are unable to predict what other proposals will be made or adopted or the effect, if any, that such proposals would have on our operations and financial condition. 
The Dodd-Frank Act established federal measures that impact the U.S. insurance business and preempt certain state insurance laws. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which is authorized to designate a non-bank financial company as “systemically significant” if its material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, there were no non-bank financial companies designated as systemically significant by the FSOC. The FSOC’s potential recommendation of measures to address systemic risk in the insurance industry could affect our insurance and reinsurance operations as could a determination that we or our counterparties are systemically significant. In November 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) issued a report recommending certain changes to the FSOC’s process for designating non-bank financial companies as systemically significant in order to make the designation process more rigorous, clear, and transparent. Any suggested changes ultimately adopted by the FSOC would be implemented by FSOC directly, rather than through legislation.
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”). The FIO does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, but it has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements. The FIO is also authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk and may recommend to the FSOC the designation of systemically important insurers. In addition, the FIO represents the U.S. at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. 
The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) to enter into international agreements of mutual recognition regarding the prudential regulation of insurance or reinsurance (“covered agreements”). In January 2017, Treasury and the USTR negotiated a covered agreement with the EU regarding the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance (the “US-EU Covered Agreement”), which was signed in September 2017. Each party has begun the process of completing its internal requirements and procedures (such as amending or promulgating appropriate statutes and regulations) in order for the US-EU Covered Agreement to enter into force. The NAIC is working on proposed amendments to the Amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Act and Model Regulation in order to satisfy the substantive and timing requirements of the US-EU Covered Agreement. In addition to removing the reinsurance collateral obligations for EU reinsurers as required by the US-EU Covered Agreement, the proposed NAIC amendments would also provide a means by which reinsurers domiciled in other qualifying non-U.S. jurisdictions as well as reinsurers domiciled in qualifying states can achieve equivalent reinsurance collateral status for reinsurance contracts with U.S. insurers.
The US-EU Covered Agreement addresses three areas of prudential insurance and reinsurance supervision: reinsurance, group supervision and the exchange of information between the U.S. and EU. Under the US-EU Covered Agreement, reinsurance collateral requirements will no longer apply to qualifying EU reinsurers that sell reinsurance to the U.S. market, and U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU market will no longer be subject to “local presence” requirements. The US-EU Covered Agreement also establishes group supervision practices that apply only to U.S. and EU insurance groups operating in both territories. For instance, the US-EU Covered Agreement provides that U.S. insurance groups with operations in the EU will be supervised at the worldwide level only by U.S. insurance regulators, and precludes EU insurance 
26

supervisors from exercising solvency and capital requirements over the worldwide operations of U.S. insurers. 
Government intervention in the property insurance market, particularly with respect to natural catastrophe losses, one of our key markets, has occurred on the state and federal level over recent years. Most significantly, beginning in 2007, the state of Florida enhanced the authority of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the “FHCF”) to offer coverage at below-market rates and expanded the ability of the state-sponsored insurer, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“Citizens”), to compete with private insurance companies, and other companies that cede business to us. This legislation reduced the role of the private insurance and reinsurance markets in Florida, a key target market of ours. In succeeding years, Florida legislation allowed Citizens to increase rates and cut back support for the FHCF, which has supported, over this period, a relatively increased role for private insurers in Florida, a market in which we have established substantial market share. However, we cannot assure you that this increased role will continue or be maintained, or that adverse new legislation will not be passed.
See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Current Outlook, Legislative and Regulatory Update” for further information regarding recent legislative and regulatory proposals and the potential effects on our business and results of operations.
U.K. Regulation
Lloyd’s Regulation
General.  The operations of RSML are subject to oversight by Lloyd’s, substantially effected through the Lloyd’s Franchise Board. RSML’s business plan for Syndicate 1458, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by the Lloyd’s Franchise Board. The Lloyd’s Franchise Board may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. Lloyd’s also imposes various charges and assessments on its members. If material changes in the business plan for Syndicate 1458 were required by the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, or if charges and assessments payable to Lloyd’s by RenaissanceRe CCL were to increase significantly, these events could have an adverse effect on the operations and financial results of RSML. We have deposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support RenaissanceRe CCL’s underwriting business at Lloyd’s. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits available for distribution.
By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, RenaissanceRe CCL has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s bye-laws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012 (the “FSMA”).
Capital Requirements.  The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit (referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s”) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined under the capital adequacy regime of the U.K.’s Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”). The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. Under these requirements, Lloyd’s must demonstrate that each member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin.
Restrictions.  A Reinsurance to Close (“RITC”) generally is put in place after the third year of operations of a syndicate year of account. On successful conclusion of a RITC, any profit from the syndicate’s operations for that year of account can be remitted by the managing agent to the syndicate’s members. If the syndicate’s managing agency concludes that an appropriate RITC cannot be determined or negotiated on commercially acceptable terms in respect of a particular underwriting year, it must determine that the underwriting year remain open and be placed into run-off. During this period, there cannot be a release of the Funds at Lloyd’s of a member of that syndicate without the consent of Lloyd’s.
The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by three independent rating agencies (A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch). Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security rating from the rating of the Lloyd’s Market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for Lloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels. RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL would be adversely affected if Lloyd’s current ratings were downgraded.
27

Intervention Powers.  The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the Funds at Lloyd’s requirements or the investment criteria applicable to the provision of Funds at Lloyd’s. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on the corporate member’s participation in a given underwriting year. If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders, the member may obtain financial assistance from the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which in many respects acts as an equivalent to a state guaranty fund in the U.S. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Council of Lloyd’s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution.
PRA and FCA Regulation
The PRA currently has ultimate responsibility for the prudential supervision of the Lloyd’s market and the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) has responsibility for market conduct regulation. Both the PRA and FCA have substantial powers of intervention in relation to Lloyd’s managing agents, such as RSML, including the power to remove an agent’s authorization to manage Lloyd’s syndicates. In addition, each year the PRA requires Lloyd’s to satisfy an annual solvency test which measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may require the entire Lloyd’s market to cease underwriting or individual Lloyd’s members may be required to cease or reduce their underwriting. 
Lloyd’s as a whole is authorized by the PRA and regulated by both the FCA and the PRA. Lloyd’s is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the PRA and by the FCA; such rules are to be implemented by Lloyd’s pursuant to its powers under the Lloyd’s Act 1982 relating to the operation of the Lloyd’s market. Lloyd’s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements. The PRA and the FCA directly monitor Lloyd’s managing agents’ compliance with the systems and controls prescribed by Lloyd’s. If it appears to either the PRA or the FCA that either Lloyd’s is not fulfilling its delegated regulatory responsibilities or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance, the PRA or the FCA may intervene at their discretion. Future regulatory changes or rulings by the PRA or FCA could impact RSML’s business strategy or financial assumptions, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on RSML’s financial condition and operating results.
Change of Control.  The PRA and the FCA currently regulate the acquisition of control of any Lloyd’s managing agent which is authorized under the FSMA. Any company or individual that, together with its or his associates, directly or indirectly acquires 10% or more of the shares in a Lloyd’s managing agent or its parent company, or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power in such Lloyd’s managing agent or its parent company, would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation, as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such Lloyd’s managing agent or its parent company by virtue of their shareholding or voting power in either. A purchaser of 10% or more of RenaissanceRe’s common shares or voting power would therefore be considered to have acquired control of RSML. Under the FSMA, any person or entity proposing to acquire control over a Lloyd’s managing agent must give prior notification to the PRA and the FCA of their or the entity’s intention to do so. The PRA and FCA would then have 60 working days to consider the application to acquire control. Failure to make the relevant prior application could result in action being taken against RSML by the PRA or the FCA or both of them. Lloyd’s approval is also required before any person can acquire control (using the same definition as for the PRA and FCA) of a Lloyd’s managing agent or Lloyd’s corporate member.
Other Applicable Laws.  Lloyd’s worldwide insurance and reinsurance business is subject to various regulations, laws, treaties and other applicable policies of the EU, as well as of each nation, state and locality in which it operates. Material changes in governmental requirements and laws could have an adverse effect on Lloyd’s and market participants, including RSML and RenaissanceRe CCL.
Solvency II
Solvency II was adopted by the European Parliament in April of 2009 and came into effect on January 1, 2016. Solvency II represents a risk-based approach to insurance regulation and capital adequacy. Its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk, effect group supervision of insurance 
28

and reinsurance affiliates, implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for (re)insurers across the EU Member States, establish consistent corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies, and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance operations. Under Solvency II, an insurer’s or reinsurer’s capital adequacy in relation to various insurance and business risks may be measured with an internal model developed by the insurer or reinsurer and approved for use by the Member State’s regulator or pursuant to a standard formula developed by the EC. The PRA granted approval to Lloyd’s internal model application in December 2015.
Singapore Regulation
Branches of Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci based in the Republic of Singapore (the “Singapore Branches”) have each received a license to carry on insurance business as a general reinsurer. The activities of the Singapore Branches are primarily regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore pursuant to Singapore’s Insurance Act. Additionally, the Singapore Branches are each regulated by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (the “ACRA”) as a foreign company pursuant to Singapore’s Companies Act.  Prior to the establishment of the Singapore Branches, Renaissance Reinsurance had maintained a representative office in Singapore commencing April 2012. We do not currently consider the activities and regulatory requirements of the Singapore Branches to be material to us.
Renaissance Services of Asia Pte. Ltd., our Singapore-based service company, was established as a private company limited by shares in Singapore on March 15, 2012 and is registered with ACRA and subject to Singapore’s Companies Act.
Ireland Regulation
Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe, incorporated under the laws of Ireland, provides coverage to insurers and reinsurers, primarily in Europe. Business is written both in Dublin and through a branch office in the U.K. 
Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe and its U.K. branch are regulated and supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland and are subject to the requirements of Solvency II. Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe is registered with the Companies Registration Office in Ireland and is subject to the Companies Act 2014. The Central Bank of Ireland adopts a risk-based framework to the supervision of regulated firms. Firms are rated according to the impact their failure would have on financial systems, the Irish economy and on the citizens of Ireland. Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe is currently considered by the Central Bank of Ireland to be a ‘low impact’ firm. We do not currently consider the regulatory requirements of Renaissance Reinsurance of Europe and its U.K. branch to be material to us. 
Renaissance Services of Europe Ltd., our Dublin-based Irish service company, was established as a private company limited by shares in Ireland and is registered with the Companies Registration Office and subject to the Companies Act 2014.
Switzerland Regulation
We have established branches of Renaissance Reinsurance and DaVinci in Zurich, Switzerland (the “Swiss Branches”). The reinsurance operations of branch offices of foreign reinsurers are not regulated by The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. We do not currently consider the activities of the Swiss Branches to be material to us.
RenaissanceRe Services of Switzerland AG, our Zurich-based service company, was established as a stock corporation in Switzerland on June 15, 2017. It is registered with the Commercial Register of Zurich is subject to Chapter 26 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS
Our principal economic exposures arise from our coverages for natural disasters and catastrophes. We believe, and believe the consensus view of current scientific studies substantiates, that changes in climate conditions, primarily global temperatures and expected sea levels, are likely to increase the severity, and possibly the frequency, of weather related natural disasters and catastrophes relative to the historical experience over the past 100 years. We believe that this expected increase in severe weather, coupled with 
29

currently projected demographic trends in catastrophe-exposed regions, contributes to factors that will increase the average economic value of expected losses, increase the number of people exposed per year to natural disasters and in general exacerbate disaster risk, including risks to infrastructure, global supply chains and agricultural production. Accordingly, we expect an increase in claims, especially from properties located in coastal areas. We have taken measures to mitigate losses related to climate change through our underwriting process and by continuously monitoring and adjusting our risk management models. 
In addition to the impacts that environmental incidents have on our business, there has been a proliferation of governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to climate change and greenhouse gases, which will also affect our business. Although most regulations related to climate change and greenhouse gases do not directly apply to our business, these regulations could indirectly impact our business. 
GLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE TERMS 
Accident year | Year of occurrence of a loss. Claim payments and reserves for claims and claim expenses are allocated to the year in which the loss occurred for losses occurring contracts and in the year the loss was reported for claims made contracts.


Acquisition expenses | The aggregate expenses incurred by a company for acquiring new business, including commissions, underwriting expenses, premium taxes and administrative expenses.


Additional case reserves | Additional case reserves represent management’s estimate of reserves for claims and claim expenses that are allocated to specific contracts, less paid and reported losses by the client.


Attachment point | The dollar amount of loss (per occurrence or in the aggregate, as the case may be) above which excess of loss reinsurance becomes operative.


Bordereaux | A report providing premium or loss data with respect to identified specific risks. This report is periodically furnished to a reinsurer by the ceding insurers or reinsurers.


Bound | A (re)insurance contract is considered bound, and the (re)insurer responsible for the risks of the contract, when both parties agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the contract.


Broker | An intermediary who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance, receiving a commission for placement and other services rendered, between (1) a policy holder and a primary insurer, on behalf of the insured party, (2) a primary insurer and reinsurer, on behalf of the primary insurer, or (3) a reinsurer and a retrocessionaire, on behalf of the reinsurer.


Capacity | The percentage of surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing or able to place at risk. Capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. Capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions.


Case reserves | Loss reserves, established with respect to specific, individual reported claims.


Casualty insurance or reinsurance | Insurance or reinsurance that is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons and their property (in other words, persons other than the policyholder) and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. Also referred to as liability insurance.

30


Catastrophe | A severe loss, typically involving multiple claimants. Common perils include earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, floods, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made disasters. Catastrophe losses may also arise from acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability.


Catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance | A form of excess of loss reinsurance that, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the amount of loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses resulting from a “catastrophe.”


Catastrophe-linked securities; cat-linked securities | Cat-linked securities are generally privately placed fixed income securities where all or a portion of the repayment of the principal is linked to catastrophic events. This includes securities where the repayment is linked to the occurrence and/or size of, for example, one or more hurricanes or earthquakes, or insured industry losses associated with these catastrophic events.


Cede; cedant; ceding company | When a party reinsures its liability with another, it “cedes” business and is referred to as the “cedant” or “ceding company.”


Claim | Request by an insured or reinsured for indemnification by an insurance company or a reinsurance company for losses incurred from an insured peril or event.


Claims made contracts | Contracts that cover claims for losses occurring during a specified period that are reported during the term of the contract.


Claims and claim expense ratio, net | The ratio of net claims and claim expenses to net premiums earned determined in accordance with either statutory accounting principles or GAAP.


Claim reserves | Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated costs of claim payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance policies it has issued. Claims reserves consist of case reserves, established with respect to individual reported claims, additional case reserves and “IBNR” reserves. For reinsurers, loss expense reserves are generally not significant because substantially all of the loss expenses associated with particular claims are incurred by the primary insurer and reported to reinsurers as losses.


Combined ratio | The combined ratio is the sum of the net claims and claim expense ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income.


Delegated authority | A contractual arrangement between an insurer or reinsurer and an agent whereby the agent is authorized to bind insurance or reinsurance on behalf of the insurer or reinsurer. The authority is normally limited to a particular class or classes of business and a particular territory. The exercise of the authority to bind insurance or reinsurance is normally subject to underwriting guidelines and other restrictions such as maximum premium income. Under the delegated authority, the agent is responsible for issuing policy documentation, the collection of premium and may also be responsible for the settlement of claims.

31


Excess of loss reinsurance or insurance | Reinsurance or insurance that indemnifies the reinsured or insured against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called a “level” or “retention.” Also known as non-proportional reinsurance. Excess of loss reinsurance is written in layers. A reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a layer of coverage up to a specified amount. The total coverage purchased by the cedant is referred to as a “program” and will typically be placed with predetermined reinsurers in pre-negotiated layers. Any liability exceeding the outer limit of the program reverts to the ceding company, which also bears the credit risk of a reinsurer’s insolvency.


Exclusions | Those risks, perils, or classes of insurance with respect to which the reinsurer will not pay loss or provide reinsurance, notwithstanding the other terms and conditions of reinsurance.


Frequency | The number of claims occurring during a given coverage period.


Funds at Lloyd’s | Funds of an approved form that are lodged and held in trust at Lloyd’s as security for a member’s underwriting activities. They comprise the members’ deposit, personal reserve fund and special reserve fund and may be drawn down in the event that the member’s syndicate level premium trust funds are insufficient to cover its liabilities. The amount of the deposit is related to the member’s premium income limit and also the nature of the underwriting account.


Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”) | Accounting principles as set forth in the statements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and related guidance, which are applicable in the circumstances as of the date in question.


Gross premiums written | Total premiums for insurance written and assumed reinsurance during a given period.


Incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) | Reserves for estimated losses that have been incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown future developments on losses that are known to the insurer or reinsurer.


Insurance-linked securities | Financial instruments whose values are driven by (re)insurance loss events. Our investments in insurance-linked securities are generally linked to property losses due to natural catastrophes.


International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) | Accounting principles, standards and interpretations as set forth in opinions of the International Accounting Standards Board which are applicable in the circumstances as of the date in question.


Layer | The interval between the retention or attachment point and the maximum limit of indemnity for which a reinsurer is responsible.


Line | The amount of excess of loss reinsurance protection provided to an insurer or another reinsurer, often referred to as limit.


Line of business | The general classification of insurance written by insurers and reinsurers, e.g., fire, allied lines, homeowners and surety, among others.


Lloyd’s | Depending on the context, this term may refer to (a) the society of individual and corporate underwriting members that insure and reinsure risks as members of one or more syndicates (i.e., Lloyd’s is not an insurance company); (b) the underwriting room in the Lloyd’s building in which managing agents underwrite insurance and reinsurance on behalf of their syndicate members (in this sense Lloyd’s should be understood as a market place); or (c) the Corporation of Lloyd’s which regulates and provides support services to the Lloyd’s market.

32


Loss; losses | An occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a claim. Whether losses are covered, limited or excluded from coverage is dependent on the terms of the policy.


Loss reserve | For an individual loss, an estimate of the amount the insurer expects to pay for the reported claim. For total losses, estimates of expected payments for reported and unreported claims. These may include amounts for claims expenses.


Managing agent | An underwriting agent which has permission from Lloyd’s to manage a syndicate and carry on underwriting and other functions for a member.


Net claims and claim expenses | The expenses of settling claims, net of recoveries, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs (also known as claim adjustment expenses or loss adjustment expenses) plus losses incurred with respect to net claims.


Net claims and claim expense ratio | Net claims and claim expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of net earned premiums.


Net premiums earned | The portion of net premiums written during or prior to a given period that was actually recognized as income during such period.


Net premiums written | Gross premiums written for a given period less premiums ceded to reinsurers and retrocessionaires during such period.


Perils | This term refers to the causes of possible loss in the property field, such as fire, windstorm, collision, hail, etc. In the casualty field, the term “hazard” is more frequently used.


Profit commission | A provision found in some reinsurance agreements that provides for profit sharing. Parties agree to a formula for calculating profit, an allowance for the reinsurer’s expenses, and the cedant’s share of such profit after expenses.


Property insurance or reinsurance | Insurance or reinsurance that provides coverage to a person with an insurable interest in tangible property for that person’s property loss, damage or loss of use.


Property per risk | Reinsurance on a treaty basis of individual property risks insured by a ceding company.


Proportional reinsurance | A generic term describing all forms of reinsurance in which the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured. (Also known as pro rata reinsurance, quota share reinsurance or participating reinsurance.) In proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer generally pays the ceding company a ceding commission. The ceding commission generally is based on the ceding company’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured (including commissions, premium taxes, assessments and miscellaneous administrative expense) and also may include a profit factor. See also “Quota Share Reinsurance”.


Quota share reinsurance | A form of proportional reinsurance in which the reinsurer assumes an agreed percentage of each insurance policy being reinsured and shares all premiums and losses accordingly with the reinsured. See also “Proportional Reinsurance”.


Reinstatement premium | The premium charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of a catastrophe contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence.

33


Reinsurance | An arrangement in which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance or reinsurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more policies. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on insurances and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. Reinsurance also provides a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more business than would be possible without an equivalent increase in capital and surplus, and facilitates the maintenance of acceptable financial ratios by the ceding company. Reinsurance does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the insured.


Reinsurance to Close | Also referred to as a RITC, it is a contract to transfer the responsibility for discharging all the liabilities that attach to one year of account of a syndicate into a later year of account of the same or different syndicate in return for a premium.


Retention | The amount or portion of risk that an insurer retains for its own account. Losses in excess of the retention level are paid by the reinsurer. In proportional treaties, the retention may be a percentage of the original policy’s limit. In excess of loss business, the retention is a dollar amount of loss, a loss ratio or a percentage.


Retrocedant | A reinsurer who cedes all or a portion of its assumed insurance to another reinsurer.


Retrocessional reinsurance; Retrocessionaire | A transaction whereby a reinsurer cedes to another reinsurer, the retrocessionaire, all or part of the reinsurance that the first reinsurer has assumed. Retrocessional reinsurance does not legally discharge the ceding reinsurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the reinsured. Reinsurance companies cede risks to retrocessionaires for reasons similar to those that cause primary insurers to purchase reinsurance: to reduce net liability on insurances, to protect against catastrophic losses, to stabilize financial ratios and to obtain additional underwriting capacity.


Risks | A term used to denote the physical units of property at risk or the object of insurance protection that are not perils or hazards. Also defined as chance of loss or uncertainty of loss.


Solvency II | A set of regulatory requirements that codify and harmonize the EU insurance and reinsurance regulation. Among other things, these requirements impact the amount of capital that EU insurance and reinsurance companies are required to hold. Solvency II came into effect on January 1, 2016.


Specialty lines | Lines of insurance and reinsurance that provide coverage for risks that are often unusual or difficult to place and do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard commercial products carriers.


Statutory accounting principles | Recording transactions and preparing financial statements in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed or permitted by Bermuda, U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities including the NAIC and/or in accordance with Lloyd’s specific principles, all of which generally reflect a liquidating, rather than going concern, concept of accounting.


Stop loss | A form of reinsurance under which the reinsurer pays some or all of a cedant’s aggregate retained losses in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or in excess of a percentage of premium.

34


Submission | An unprocessed application for (i) insurance coverage forwarded to a primary insurer by a prospective policyholder or by a broker on behalf of such prospective policyholder, (ii) reinsurance coverage forwarded to a reinsurer by a prospective ceding insurer or by a broker or intermediary on behalf of such prospective ceding insurer or (iii) retrocessional coverage forwarded to a retrocessionaire by a prospective ceding reinsurer or by a broker or intermediary on behalf of such prospective ceding reinsurer.


Surplus lines insurance | Any type of coverage that cannot be placed with an insurer admitted to do business in a certain jurisdiction. Risks placed in excess and surplus lines markets are often substandard in respect to adverse loss experience, unusual, or unable to be placed in conventional markets due to a shortage of capacity.
Syndicate | A member or group of members underwriting (re)insurance business at Lloyd’s through the agency of a managing agent or substitute agent to which a syndicate number is assigned. 


Treaty | A reinsurance agreement covering a book or class of business that is automatically accepted on a bulk basis by a reinsurer. A treaty contains common contract terms along with a specific risk definition, data on limit and retention, and provisions for premium and duration.


Underwriting | The insurer’s or reinsurer’s process of reviewing applications submitted for insurance coverage, deciding whether to accept all or part of the coverage requested and determining the applicable premiums.


Underwriting capacity | The maximum amount that an insurance company can underwrite. The limit is generally determined by a company’s retained earnings and investment capital. Reinsurance serves to increase a company’s underwriting capacity by reducing its exposure from particular risks.


Underwriting expense ratio | The ratio of the sum of the acquisition expenses and operational expenses to net premiums earned.


Underwriting expenses | The aggregate of policy acquisition costs, including commissions, and the portion of administrative, general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations.


Unearned premium | The portion of premiums written representing the unexpired portions of the policies or contracts that the insurer or reinsurer has on its books as of a certain date.
