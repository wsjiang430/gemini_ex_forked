ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History

Eurosport Active World Corporation (the Company) (formerly Eagle International Holdings Group Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on August 23, 2000 as a shell entity that was in the market to merge with an operating company.
 
On March 17, 2008, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Acquisition (the Merger Agreement) with Inko Sport America, LLC (ISA), a Florida privately-held limited liability company. ISA was a development stage company, incorporated on February 24, 2005. In connection with the closing of the Merger Agreement, ISA merged with and into the Company effective May 7, 2008, with the filing of the Merger Agreement with the Florida Secretary of State.

The Company then adopted ISAs business plan and changed its name to Eurosport Active World Corp. Further, upon completion of the merger, the prior officers and directors resigned, and the Companys current officers and directors were elected or appointed to their positions.
 
This transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein ISA was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.

The Business
 
We are an engineering services company formed as an outsourcing green tech platform, seeking to exploit renewable technologies. 

In view of the increased world-wide demand for water and energy, our business goals are focused on water generation, water purification, and green energy production (waste to energy). To accomplish this, we set out to establish an outsourcing green tech platform, seeking to provide engineering and technical consultation services to design the most sustainable technological solutions that can provide water and energy, as well as manage the waste in a closed cycle. We also intend to secure all required technical, maintenance, education and training related to the identified technology solutions. To this end the Company has sought the potential collaboration with green tech research and development centers in Europe.
 
The green tech industry is constantly evolving due to ongoing and increasing water scarcity as well as increased energy need, thereby, we believe, that by designing the most sustainable renewable solutions to these problems it would become an essential component of a rapidly growing industry with many new markets. The green tech industry is complex, because it still requires much promotion and information about its potential. Furthermore, regulations in each country are different and, in many cases, several segments are regulated by both central and local (state, provincial, municipal) governments. EAWCs approach seeks to assist general business operations with the growth and development of their business, by ensuring the efficient, profitable and sustainable supply/generation of water and energy allowing our potential customers to focus on their business while adopting strategies of sustainability. Using the technology, products, and services licensed or purchased from other technological sources, we believe we will be able to deliver and install a product set that suits the green technology water and/or energy needs of our customers. By using the designed technological solutions and technologies identified and provided by EAWC potential partners, we believe, that our potential clients can be free to focus on performance of their operations as well as with the water and energy consumption or generation regulations within their industry. Our clients may be businesses seeking to upgrade their business processes or governmental entities seeking to apply green technology solutions for the water and energy they supply their constituencies.
 
We continue to be a development stage company. Our Company presently outsources most of the services for the engineering and technical services as well as for the promotion, selling and distribution of the identified technological solutions. We presently have only two employees: Mr. Hofmeier, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a significant stockholder, and Ms. Velazquez, our Chief Operating Officer, Vice-Chairman and a significant stockholder.
 
We seek to focus on four main aspects of the water and energy business: generation, supply, commercialization and waste to energy, seeking to assist business owners and/or municipalities to build profitable and sustainable supply/generation of water and energy as required, and selling them the required technology or technical service to enhance their productivity/operability. With its outsourced technical arm and its commission based global network of vendors, the Company expects to create sustainable added value to each project it takes on while generating revenue from the engineering and technical consultancy services and project management, selling of the various identified technologies, royalties from the commercialization of energy and water in certain cases and revenues from the licensed innovated technologies.

Our core technological solutions are center around:


· | Waste to Energy Process Design - a Plasma Gasification based process, self-powered by electricity generated by syngas. The process is based on the dissociation (breaking apart) of the molecular bonds of solid, liquid and gaseous compounds or materials of both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes (feedstock) organic and inorganic. Depends on the type of the operations daily input, significant amounts of energy, water and valuable hydrogen gas for sustainable power generation can be generated.
· | Solar Power Water Purification process - a high-volume water purification solution utilizing solar, photovoltaic energy and, when applicable, a mini-windmill or an alternate source of renewable energy. From the sea, lake, river or stagnant, water is passed through several stages of purification and treatment until it is rendered drinkable as per World Health Organization standards. We believe that its innovative design allows its implementation in a challenging geographical location. 
· | Atmosphere Water Generator system- powered by a renewable energy solution, the AWG produces pure potable water from the airs humidity. We believe that the system could produce sufficient quantities even at very dry and hot climate conditions. 


We intend to provide customized technology solutions and technical services, based upon client need/preference, which may include any or all of the following:
 

· | water/energy generation; 
· | waste to energy plants; 
· | technical assistance; 
· | strategic and financial partnering;
· | project management. 

 
The Company also focused on addressing areas of business, which concentrate on new technological and engineering concepts relating to water and energy generation as well as waste to energy development and those related components that assist in advancing the green tech industry. These include:
 

· | advancement of atmosphere water generators; 
· | development of techniques to attain self-sufficient supply of energy; 
· | advancement of new ideas on waste to energy implementation; 
· | distribution of small, hi-energy cost effective generators; 
· | Designing, prototyping and arranging the manufacture of new syngas engine/motors.

During 2013 the Company also accrued the minimum annual license fee of approximately $542,000 in accordance with the terms of the agreement, which was settled in the second quarter of 2014. On April 15, 2015, SWATE agreed to waive licenses fees for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015. On January 29, 2016, SWATE agreed to waive licenses fees for the years ended 2016 and 2017. 

On January 5, 2018, the parties terminated the Technology Transfer and License Agreement. Further, it was agreed that the Company was entitled to manufacture the products only and exclusively for the concept of waste to energy without having to pay any further royalties until February 1, 2023. Effective with the termination of the Technology Transfer and License Agreement, all commercial activities between SWATE and the Company ceased.

Pursuant to the Technology Transfer and License Agreement, the products subject to such agreement include the following: (1) Design of Waste to Energy process assisted by a Plasma Converter system; (2) Design of Solar Power Water Purification system and the (3) Design of Atmosphere Water Generator. The Company is pursuing relationships with other technology sources to supplement its Atmosphere Water Generator Solar and Power Water Purification technologies.

International Service Contract - Effective February 1, 2013, the Company also entered into an International Service Contract with SWATE (the SWATE Service Contract). Under this agreement, SWATE will provide operations management, engineering and technical services to the Company. The SWATE Service Contract had a term of five years, and provides for a monthly service fee of $35,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses. 

On November 1, 2016, SWATE and the Company executed a Termination of its International Services Contract effective from December 31, 2016. The termination cited default of important obligations, in particular the payment within an agreed period of time and the person responsible for the Service Provider, would no longer be employed. It was further agreed that the outstanding balance at December 31, 2016 of $712,070 would be settled with the issuance of 712,070 EAWC restricted common shares fair valued at $85,448. The excess of $626,622 was accounted for as a capital contribution. EAWC issued the shares on February 2, 2018.

As a result of the above agreements, the Company has a variable implicit interest in SWATE, however it is not its primary beneficiary, does not provide any explicit or implied financial support and therefore does not consolidate SWATE's financial statements in its consolidated financial statements.

Other Acquisitions

During 2012, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 25,300,000 shares of its common stock in connection with its acquisitions of Powermax Energy & Business Solution, Inc. (Powermax Energy), Powermax Green Technologies, LLC (Powermax Green Technologies), Green Environmental Management LLC (GEM); Swiss Green Solutions, Srl (Swiss Green Solutions) and International Supply & Support-African Sunlight-Solstrom (African Sunlight). The latter entities were inactive and except for African Sunlight were acquired from Mr. Hofmeier, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a significant stockholder, and/or Ms. Velazquez, our Chief Operating Officer, Vice-Chairman and a significant stockholder. The equity interests issued were recorded at an amount equal to the carrying amount of the net assets related to the latter entities. We undertook these acquisitions to secure certain intellectual property rights, technologies and accreditations as further explained below.
 
During 2013, the Company issued common stock pursuant to its 2012 acquisition of Swiss Green Solutions, a corporation originally organized in Switzerland (Swiss Green). The Company acquired 100% of Swiss Green all of which was held by our Ms. Velazquez, our Chief Operating Officer and Vice-Chairman, in exchange for 8,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at par. The Company acquired Swiss Green to secure design patent No. 138,065 for the Solar Power Water Purification System and all related technical designs and materials. The duration of the foregoing patent is 20 years. The acquisition of the patent allows the Company to complete its suite of water equipment technologies using a Swiss water purification concept based on Swiss solar technology.
 
During 2013, the Company issued common stock pursuant to its 2012 acquisition of African Sunlight, a corporation originally organized in Norway. In connection with this acquisition the Company acquired all of the ownership interest all of which was held by a third party, in African Sunlight in exchange for 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $1 per share. The Company acquired African Sunlight seeking to secure a vendor accreditation that allows the Company to supply water generation and purification, Energy generation as well as Waste to Energy Technological solutions to the United Nations members.
 
Powermax Energy was 100% owned by Mr. Hofmeier, the Companys President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a significant stockholder. By this acquisition we secured the licensee rights for the core technologies for water and energy products from the patent owners of the technologies, AQUA SOCIETY GmbH, Germany. With the license, EAWC has the right to sell, manufacture and develop the core technologies of water and energy equipment for ninety-nine years across the world. In certain countries and regions like Mexico, Latin America and the United Sates, EAWC was granted exclusive rights by Powermax Energy.
 
EAWC attained 100% ownership of Green Environmental Management (GEM) a Texas entity by purchasing the remaining 50% we did not own from Irma Velazquez, our COO for 9 million shares of our common stock. As a result, EAWC has acquired certain trade secrets with regard to process and commercialization methods and agreements for access to several Swiss and US Universities for environmental studies and support, which we believe can serve to enhance our know-how of green tech solutions. 

The above described acquisitions gave EAWC the necessary tools to be a green tech company with an international outlook. As a result of these acquisitions EAWC has the ability to sell and distribute its technical and engineering services as well as our potential partners technologies around the world. 
 
Our Vision
 
The mission of EAWC is to provide sustainable water production design and already commercialized systems as well as energy design and systems based on high efficiency and renewable sources, and also smart grid and storage solutions. Through a combination of the best design and configuration of AquaTech, EnergyTech and waste management assisted solutions and technologies, we believe that it is possible to create a completely self-sufficient energy generation and water production system, which can be used at the same time to meet the potable water requirements as well as the electrical energy needs of businesses, communities and entire States, like California in USA and or Cape Town in South Africa.

EAWC seeks to promote green technology solutions through based-commissioned distributers and agents worldwide. EAWC anticipates using Made in Germany Green Tech, Swiss and US technologies such as: atmosphere water generators (AWGs), CO2-free energy production (steam energy generators), plasma-assisted gasification and sterilizations systems, solar-powered water purification systems, as well as those in solar and wind energy solutions which we may, when our financial condition permits, further develop ourselves.
 
Today we believe we have potential technology partners, technology transfer agreements and technology representation agreements in place relating to aspects of renewable energy and water supply and we believe one of our key unique selling features and capabilities is this relationship. We believe that one of our key unique selling features and capabilities is the combination of the different disciplines of water, energy and waste management.

Revenue would be generated by the sales of Engineering and Technical Consultancy Services, sales of various identified technologies, royalties from the sales of energy and/or water in certain projects.

The departments of our Company are to be broken down as follows:

The technological solutions offered by our Company are the following:

Atmosphere Water Generators (AWGs) & Aqua Mission Systems
 
AWGs produce pure potable water from the air´s humidity. The system produces sufficient quantities of potable water even in very dry and hot climate conditions. AWG plants can be scaled to almost any size, community and/or population. Presently, Atmosphere Water Generators are largely used in Asia and African countries. The main producers for AWGs, which are based on dehumidifying, come from China. Almost every US based AWG brand is supplied by manufacturers in China. EAWC plans to use 80 year proven German technology for condensate water from the air based on A/C technology. We believe that this concept allows a higher performance and larger quantity of water because of the use of high amounts of air. Our previous affiliate, SWATE, developed particularly for the California market the OCTAGON AWG system. This system is based on the German patent for AWG Tech from AQUA SOCIETY GmbH, Germany. EAWC has the rights for ninety-nine years to use this German technology under patent number 2009/140944. The OCTAGON model line is different in size from the standard AM water generator line. The OCTAGON is energy self-sufficient and we believe can condense unlimited amounts of water out of the atmosphere. SWATE allowed EAWC the use of this development, which we believe can be used in many other countries around the world that deal with issues of water scarcity. EAWC plans to introduce the OCTAGON to the UN in the last fiscal quarter of 2018, with the hopes of supplying it to large refugee camps around the world in need of fresh water.

The AWGs work by first inhaling large volumes of air, then cooling the air down to the dew point, and finally collecting, filtering and mineralizing the resulting condensed water. Through this process, pure drinking water is created that meets the quality standards of the World Health Organization (WHO). In regions with high temperatures and high humidity levels, a single machine can generate up to 50,000 liters or 15,000 gallons of water per day. The OCTAGON line starts at 150,000 gallons and can expand the water supply to ONE acre-feet/day, which we believe, in effect, is essentially the ability to produce an unlimited supply of water.
 
Solar Power Water Purification Systems
 
EAWC Technologies seeks to respond to the growing need of drinking water and proposes a water purification solution utilizing solar, photovoltaic energy and, when applicable, a mini- windmill or an alternate source of renewable energy. We believe that the design of the system is ready to be built and delivered on demand. 
 
Seawater, lake water, river water or stagnant water is passed through several stages of purification and treatment until it is rendered drinkable as per World Health Organization standards. In the case of sea or stagnant water, we recommend a treatment via reverse osmosis membranes, which permits the retention of dissolved solids and results in obtaining water of drinking quality. If the water being treated emanates from lakes or rivers, we recommend treatment via an ultrafiltration membrane which functions by retaining suspended materials such as colloids, viruses and bacteria. The systems proposed by EAWC Technologies are containerized and we believe contain all equipment necessary to function in a perfectly autonomous fashion, notably due to a system of automatic cleansing, which can be accessed from a distance via satellite or Internet. Moreover, the machines also use available, renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. The system has been tested in the field by SWATE and certified, by SWATE as ready to be deployed on demand.
 
Steam Energy Generators
 
In a world where the goal of zero carbon factories, cities and economies is a priority for individuals, corporations and governments, we believe that the Energy Module offers zero carbon power generation in a simple, economical and reliable system.
 
The waste heat given off in industrial processes in the low-temperature range (up to 100°C) constitutes an energy potential in all industrialized countries that is substantially untapped. EAWC offers what we believe to be a novel process for generating electric current from low-temperature heat, thereby capturing the potential from this lost heat, which is produced in many industrial processes, to be used to produce electricity. In addition to its potential using wasted heat, the process can also utilize heat from other sources for the generation of electricity, including solar energy, geothermal heat, or technically conditioned waste heat flows from power stations and combined heat and power plants. Through the specific utilization of low-temperature heat for the generation of electricity, we believe that a major worldwide contribution can be made in reducing the consumption of fossil energy resources and cutting CO2 emissions. The system is patented and owned by Aqua Society GmbH, Germany. EAWC has the rights, worldwide, to sell this technology which has been utilized in installations in Austria and Switzerland. 

Plasma Converter System (PCS)
 
We believe that one of the primary strengths and capabilities of the Company is the synergistic combination of the complementary disciplines of water, energy and waste management. EAWC seeks to offer a closed-loop elemental recycling system that we believe safely destroys waste and produces commodity products, including water, energy, syngas, fertilizers, CO2 certificates (CO2 certificates represent the amount of emissions that are compensated for), and the real and closed cycle of waste management. We believe that the EAWC waste to energy system can achieve this without producing harmful, noxious or dangerous by-products, effluents or emissions. The materials fed into the process are actual feed stocks, such as household waste and solid sewage waste.
 
The PCS is a gas converter that ionizes gas, which becomes an effective electrical conductor and produces a lightning-like arc of electricity that is the source of intense energy transferred to the waste material as radiant energy. The arc in the plasma plume within the vessel can be as high as 30,000°F or 16,650°C. 
 
The PCS is an electrochemical system powered by electricity that causes the dissociation (breaking apart) of the molecular bonds of solid, liquid and gaseous compounds or materials of both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes (feedstock) both organic and inorganic. Within the PCS, the molecules of the waste material are separated into their elemental components (atoms), and then reformed into recoverable nonhazardous commodity productswater, electricity, syngas, fertilizers, CO2 certificates, and closed cycle of waste managementready for commercial use.

The PCS does not involve a burning operation within an incinerator. The PCS ignites ionized gas from electric spark like in a neon light bulb. Patented for the first time in 1804 in Germany, the gasification system was widely used in Europe until the mid-1940s. The Syngas produced out of the organic/carbon base material can be used to power an internal combustion engine or a turbine to run an electrical generator. Today, over 400 gasification plants to process wastes are in use, mostly in Europe. The gas is used to produce electricity or clean fuel.
 
The PCS is computer controlled and easy to use. We believe that it operates safely and at normal atmospheric pressure by quietly generating sustainable power. We believe that significant valuable resources can be created from the use of the PCS. For example, 1,000 tons-per-day of urban and industrial waste of all kinds that is processed by a typical large municipality can be converted safely and emission-free into syngas. The operations daily output of syngas can be used to produce millions of cubic feet of valuable hydrogen gas. In a typical 1,000 tons-per-day operation, we believe that the PCS, with a 7.8-ton capacity, could theoretically pay for itself in well under two years. Landfill usage tipping fees run from an average $35 to over $100 per ton in high population areas. Tipping fees are charges levied upon a given quantity of waste received at a waste processing facility. In the case of a landfill it is generally levied to offset the cost of opening, maintaining and eventually closing the site. It may also include any landfill tax which is applicable in the region. These costs, along with hauling fees, could be reduced by up to $75 per-ton/per-day by plasma-converting the waste and selling the electric, water, gas, and solid by-products, identified above instead of paying the applicable tipping fees.
 
Plasma Assisted Sterilization Process
 
The Plasma Arc Flow is a patented technology that converts most liquid waste into a clean fuel called syngas. It works by moving the target liquid waste through a submerged electric arc between two electrodes. The arc decomposes the liquid molecules into atoms and forms a plasma around the tips of the electrodes. At about 10,000°F / 5,500°C the plasma arc flow moves the plasma away from the electrodes and controls the formation of syngas that rises to the surface for collection. This technology is intended solely to sterilize target liquid wastes such as sewage, agricultural wastes or any effluent where eliminating bacteriological activity is beneficial to convert the waste liquid into a fertilizer and/or irrigation water. These outputs from processing toxic liquid are completely sterilized. EAWC has the sole rights granted to sell the technology in Mexico. The process results in production of syngas which can be used to produce electricity either through direct combustion of the syngas or through use of the syngas as a fuel for steam generation technology; the residue in either case is a fertilizer.
Worldwide Business Relationships
 
EAWC has commission-based agents and distributors strategically placed around the world. The Company has sales agents in Germany, Mexico and Miami. The Company also has dealers located in Las Vegas, Nevada, India, Pakistan, Canada, Australia, Colombia, Nepal and Kenya. In total, we work with 34 commission-based agents and distributors to promote and sell EAWCs technology solutions. Their compensation is commission-based.

We believe that this worldwide presence through our agents and distributors will provide us access the most important markets in need of energy, fresh water and waste to energy solutions.
 
Competition
 
The atmospheric water generator and water purification and bottled water industries are highly competitive. Competition is intense and is expected to increase. This market is characterized by technological innovation and change. We plan to compete by providing products and services that are valued by our customers such as sales relationships, product innovations, and responses to changing market/business needs. 

Our main competitors at this time are Ambient Water Corp., Quest Water Global, Inc. and Westinghouse Plasma Corporation. This market segment includes numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers, and retailers that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad. In addition, the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products and technologies that may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. As a result, our ability to remain competitive depends in part upon successful introduction and consumer acceptance of new products. We expect that the competition will intensify in the future, since our competitors can and may duplicate similar products or services to those offered by us.

Government Regulation
 
The manufacturing, processing, testing, packaging, labeling and advertising of the technologies that we sell may be subject to regulation by one or more U.S. federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the standards provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization for drinking water. Our operations may also be regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which consumers reside. Currently, the technologies we intend to use in our solutions and our services are not subject to any governmental regulation although it is possible that the FDA may choose to regulate the quality of water produced from atmospheric water generating machines.
 
Since the Company may be subject to a wide range of regulation covering every aspect of our business as mentioned above, we cannot predict the nature of any future U.S. laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on the business in the future. Although the regulation of water is less restrictive than that of drugs and food additives, we cannot offer assurance that the current statutory scheme and regulations applicable to water will remain less restrictive. Further, we cannot assure you that, under existing laws and regulations, or if more stringent statutes are enacted, regulations are promulgated, or enforcement policies are adopted, we are or will be in compliance with these existing or new statutes, regulations or enforcement policies without incurring material expenses or adjusting our business strategy. Any laws, regulations, enforcement policies, interpretations or applications applicable to our business could require the reformulation of products, all of which are supplied by third parties, to meet new standards or the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we currently have two full-time employees. Over time, we will be required to hire employees or continue to engage independent contractors in order to execute the projects necessary to grow and develop the business. These decisions will be made by our officers and directors, if and when appropriate. We work with approximately 34 commission-based agents and brokers around the world to promote the Company and sell our technological solutions and services. These agents and brokers are independent contractors with whom we have contractual relationships; they are compensated solely based on commission. 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We elected to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although we will lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
