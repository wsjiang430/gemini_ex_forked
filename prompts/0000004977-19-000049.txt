Item 1. Business

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Aflac Incorporated (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This report includes certain forward-looking information that is based on current expectations and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For details on forward-looking information, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), Part II, Item 7, of this report.
Aflac Incorporated qualifies as a large accelerated filer within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act). The Company's Internet address is aflac.com. The information on the Company's website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Company makes available, free of charge on the Investors portion of its website, the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments thereto as soon as reasonably practicable after those forms have been electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
General Description
Aflac Incorporated was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. Aflac Incorporated is a general business holding company and acts as a management company, overseeing the operations of its subsidiaries by providing management services and making capital available. Its principal business is voluntary supplemental and life insurance, which is marketed and administered through American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (Aflac) in the United States (Aflac U.S.) and, effective April 1, 2018, through Aflac Life Insurance Japan Ltd. in Japan (Aflac Japan). Prior to April 1, 2018, the Company's insurance business was marketed in Japan as a branch of Aflac. American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aflac. Most of Aflac's policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, Aflac U.S. markets and administers group products through Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), branded as Aflac Group Insurance. The Company's insurance operations in the United States and Japan service the two markets for the Company's insurance business. 
Effective April 1, 2018, the Company converted Aflac Japan from a branch to a subsidiary incorporated as a Japanese stock corporation. The transaction was accounted for as tax-neutral and did not have a material impact on the daily operations of either Aflac Japan or Aflac U.S. In addition, the Company obtained and expects to continue to obtain enhanced flexibility in capital management and business development as a result of the conversion.
The Company offers voluntary insurance policies in Japan and the United States that provide a layer of financial protection against income and asset loss. The Company continues to diversify its product offerings in both Japan and the United States. Aflac Japan sells voluntary supplemental insurance products, including cancer plans, general medical indemnity plans, medical/sickness riders, care plans, living benefit life plans, ordinary life insurance plans and annuities. Aflac U.S. sells voluntary supplemental insurance products including products designed to protect individuals from depletion of assets (accident, cancer, critical illness/care, hospital indemnity, fixed-benefit dental, and vision care plans) and loss-of-income products (life and short-term disability plans).
The Company is authorized to conduct insurance business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, several U.S. territories and Japan. 
Reporting Segments
The Company's insurance business consists of two reporting segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan is the principal contributor to the Parent Company’s consolidated earnings. Aflac Japan's revenues, including realized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, accounted for 70% of the Company's total revenues in 2018, compared with 70% in 2017 and 71% in 2016. The percentage of the Company's total assets attributable to Aflac Japan was 84% and 83% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The conversion of Aflac Japan to a subsidiary structure did not affect the Company's segment reporting structure.
For information on the Company's results of operations and financial information by segment, see MD&A and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
Item 1. Business

Certain Performance Measures
The Company evaluates its premium growth and sales efforts using the following performance measures:

• | Annualized premiums in force is defined as the amount of gross premium that a policyholder must pay over a full year in order to keep coverage. The growth of net premiums (defined below) is directly affected by the change in premiums in force and by the change in weighted-average yen/dollar exchange rates.


• | New annualized premium sales (sometimes referred to as new sales or sales) is an operating measure that is not reflected on the Company's financial statements. New annualized premium sales generally represents annual premiums on policies the Company sold and incremental increases from policy conversions, collected over a 12-month period, assuming the policies remain in force. For Aflac Japan, new annualized premium sales are determined by applications submitted during the reporting period. For Aflac U.S., new annualized premium sales are determined by applications that are issued during the reporting period. Conversions are defined as the positive difference in the annualized premium when a policy upgrades in the current reporting period.


• | Net premiums (sometimes referred to as net premium income or net earned premiums) is a financial measure that appears on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in its segment reporting. This measure reflects collected or due premiums that have been earned ratably on policies in force during the reporting period, reduced by premiums that have been ceded to third parties and increased by premiums assumed through reinsurance.

Foreign Currency Translation
Aflac Japan’s premiums and approximately half of its investment income are received in yen. Claims and most expenses are paid in yen, and the Company purchases yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. For information regarding the effect of currency fluctuations on the Company's business, see the Hedging Activities subsection within the Analysis of Financial Condition section of MD&A, the Currency Risk subsection within Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. For information regarding how the Company’s investment strategy supports management of foreign currency risk, refer to the Investments subsection below.

Japan
Aflac Japan's insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japan's national health insurance system. Changes in Japan's economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japan's national health care system. As a result, more costs have been shifted to Japanese 
Item 1. Business

consumers, who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs. Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products.
The foundation of Aflac Japan's product portfolio has been, and continues to be, its third sector products, which include cancer, medical and income support insurance products. Aflac pioneered the cancer insurance market in Japan in 1974, and remains the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan today. Over the years, Aflac Japan has customized its cancer insurance product to respond to, and anticipate, the needs of its consumers and the advances in medical treatments. The cancer insurance plans the Company offers in Japan provide a lump-sum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and benefits for treatment received due to internal cancer such as fixed daily benefits for hospitalization, outpatient services and convalescent care, surgical benefits, and outpatient treatments. Aflac Japan has a unique Aflac-branded cancer insurance product for Japan's postal system, Japan Post (see the Distribution - Japan section for background information). In April 2018, Aflac Japan introduced a new cancer insurance product, DAYS 1, with enhanced cancer benefits. In addition to providing benefits for hospitalization, outpatient treatment, surgery, radiation therapy and anti-cancer drug treatment, this product was designed to provide benefits to improve quality of life and to cover out-of-pocket expenses not directly related to medical treatment. At the same time, Aflac Japan introduced DAYS 1 Plus to provide existing holders with up-to-date coverage. As the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan, the Company believes these products further strengthen its brand, and most importantly, provide valuable benefits to consumers who are looking for solutions to manage cancer-related costs. 
Aflac Japan's EVER product is a stand-alone, whole-life medical insurance product which offers a basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium. The current version of this product includes riders to be associated with three critical illnesses (cancer, heart attack, and stroke) to better respond to consumers' needs for coverage of serious illnesses. These riders provide policyholders with a benefit upon the diagnosis for those three critical illnesses, waiver of premium payment thereafter and unlimited hospital days for such critical illnesses. Since its initial introduction, Aflac Japan has expanded its suite of EVER product offerings to appeal to specific types of Japanese consumers and achieve greater market penetration. In 2017, Aflac Japan revised the EVER product by introducing riders for lump-sum hospitalization benefits and surgeries for female-specific diseases as well as strengthening outpatient benefits and reducing premiums centered on the young- to middle-aged market segments. This product also offers a short-pay premium period to policyholders. Gentle EVER, Aflac Japan's non-standard medical insurance product, was designed to meet the needs of certain consumers who cannot qualify for the base EVER plan. 
In October 2018, Aflac Japan launched a new type of medical product referred to as Health Promotion Medical Insurance where a policyholder is entitled to a partial refund of the premium if the policyholders' “health age” measured by certain health check items is lower than his or her actual age. This product is marketed exclusively online and targeted at younger generations.
The Company believes that the affordable cancer and medical insurance products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of its product portfolio. Nevertheless, as the Company continues its long history of product innovation, Aflac Japan's product portfolio has expanded beyond traditional health-related products. 
Aflac Japan's Income Support Insurance provides fixed-benefit amounts in the event that a policyholder is unable to work due to significant illness or injury and was developed to supplement the disability coverage within Japan’s social security system. This product targets young to middle-aged consumers, and by focusing efforts on this demographic, Aflac Japan believes it is building relationships that lay the groundwork for the sale of its cancer and medical insurance later in life to the Income Support policyholders.
Beginning in 2013, Aflac Japan began to curtail sales of first sector savings-type products, such as WAYS, child endowment and fixed annuities, due to persistent low interest rates in Japan and, in particular, the relatively large capital commitment required by such products and their lower profitability, in such an environment. Aflac Japan continues to sell first sector protection-type products, which include term and whole life, to provide Aflac Japan’s traditional sales channels with a more comprehensive product portfolio to continue to cross-sell with third sector products. In July 2018, Aflac Japan introduced a first sector protection whole life product with low cash surrender value, which offers non-smoking policyholders further discounted premiums.

Item 1. Business

U.S.
The Company designs its U.S. insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage. Most of Aflac's U.S. policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents. Additionally, Aflac U.S. started to market and administer group insurance products in 2009.
Aflac U.S. insurance policies pay benefits regardless of other insurance. Most of the Aflac U.S. insurance benefits are paid in cash directly to policyholders; therefore, customers have the opportunity to use this cash to help with expenses of their choosing.
Aflac U.S. offers accident coverage on both an individual and group basis. These policies pay cash benefits in the event of a covered injury. The accident portion of the policy includes lump-sum benefits for accidental death, dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement. Additional benefits are also available for home modifications, wellness and increased benefits for injuries related to participations in an organized sporting activity.
Aflac U.S. offers short-term disability benefits on both an individual and group basis. The individual short-term disability product has an Aflac Value Rider that pays a benefit, less claims, for every consecutive five-year term that the policy is in force.
Aflac U.S. offers coverage for critical care on both an individual and group basis. These policies are designed to pay cash benefits in the event of critical illnesses such as heart attack, stroke, or cancer. On an individually underwritten basis, Aflac U.S. offers cancer plans, critical illness plans, and critical care and recovery plans (formerly called specified health event). On a group basis Aflac U.S. offers critical illness plans. 
Aflac U.S. offers hospital indemnity coverage on both an individual and group basis. Hospital indemnity products provide policyholders fixed dollar benefits triggered by hospitalization due to accident or sickness, or just sickness alone. Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries, as well as various other diagnostic events, are also available. Aflac U.S. also offers a lump sum rider that can be added to its individual accident, short-term disability and hospital indemnity products. This rider, where available, provides a lump sum payment for a range of critical illness events including traumatic brain injury, Type 1 diabetes, advanced Alzheimer’s disease and many more. In January 2016, a new group hospital indemnity plan was introduced that includes 11 new benefits, including telemedicine and health screening. This plan provides flexibility, allowing the Company's clients to personalize their plan designs to complement the underlying medical coverage that is offered to employees. 
Aflac U.S. offers additional coverages to those listed above, including dental, vision and life policies. Aflac U.S. offers fixed-benefit dental coverage on both an individual and group basis. Aflac U.S. offers Vision NowSM, an individually issued policy which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight as well as coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits. Aflac U.S. also offers term- and whole-life policies on both an individual and group basis.

Japan
The traditional channels through which Aflac Japan has sold its products consist of individual agents/agencies, independent corporate agencies, and affiliated corporate agencies. The individual agencies and independent corporate agencies that sell Aflac Japan's products give better access to workers at a vast number of small businesses in Japan. Agents' activities are primarily focused on insurance sales, with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center. Affiliated corporate agencies are initially formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell Aflac Japan's insurance products to employees as part of a benefit package, and in some cases expand to sell Aflac Japan products to other parties such as suppliers and customers.These agencies help Aflac Japan reach employees at large 
Item 1. Business

worksites, and some of them are also successful in approaching customers outside their business groups. The Company believes that new agencies will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japan's competitive commissions, attractive products, superior customer service and strong brand image.
The Company has sold products to employees of banks since its entry into Japan in 1974. However, December 2007 marked the first time it was permissible for banks to sell Aflac Japan's type of insurance products to their customers. By the end of 2018, Aflac Japan had agreements with approximately 90% of the total number of banks in Japan, to sell its products. The Company believes Aflac Japan has more banks selling its supplemental health insurance products than any of its competitors. Japanese consumers rely on banks to provide traditional bank services, and also to provide insurance solutions and other services. The Company believes Aflac Japan's long-standing and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector, along with its strategic preparations, have proven to be an advantage, particularly starting when this channel opened up for its products. Aflac Japan's partnerships throughout the banking sector provide Aflac Japan with a wider demographic of potential customers than it would otherwise have been able to reach, and it also allows banks to expand their product and service offerings to consumers. 
In 2005, legislation aimed at privatizing Japan's postal system (Japan Post) was enacted into law. The privatization laws split Japan Post into four operating entities that began operating in October 2007. In 2007, one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices, and, in 2008, Aflac Japan began selling cancer insurance through these post offices. Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products. Legislation to reform the postal system passed Japan’s legislature, the Diet, in April 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities (the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices) in October 2012. In July 2013, Aflac Japan entered into a new agreement with Japan Post Holdings to further expand the partnership that was established in 2008. In June 2014, Japan Post Insurance (Kampo) received approval from Japan’s primary insurance regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), to enter into an agency contract with Aflac Japan. Under this contract, Aflac Japan currently distributes its cancer insurance products through 76 of Kampo's directly managed sales offices. Aflac Japan has developed a unique Aflac-branded cancer insurance product for Japan Post and Kampo that was introduced in October 2014. In 2015, Japan Post expanded the number of post offices that offer Aflac's cancer insurance products to more than 20,000 postal outlets. 
The Company believes this alliance with Japan Post, which is included in Aflac Japan's affiliated corporate agencies distribution channel, has benefited and will continue to benefit Aflac Japan's cancer insurance sales. For example, sales of cancer insurance policies by Japan Post constituted approximately 25% of Aflac Japan's third sector sales during the 2018 calendar year. In December 2018, the Company announced that in a further strengthening of this alliance. Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd, a Japanese corporation, (Japan Post Holdings) plans to purchase approximately 7% of the Parent Company's outstanding common shares through a trust using open market and private block purchases. Like all common shares in the Parent Company, the shares purchased by the trust will be eligible for 10-for-1 voting rights after being held for 48 consecutive months. In connection with this announcement, on December 19, 2018, the Parent Company and Aflac Japan entered into a Basic Agreement regarding the "Strategic Alliance Based on Capital Relationship" with Japan Post Holdings (Basic Agreement), and the Parent Company entered into a letter agreement with Japan Post Holdings (Letter Agreement). Under the Letter Agreement, Japan Post Holdings agreed (i) to establish and fund a voting trust in accordance with a trust agreement (Trust Agreement) by no later than February 28, 2019, (ii) upon establishment of the trust, to instruct the trustee and the sole shareholder of the trust to enter into, and to itself enter into, a shareholders agreement with the Parent Company (Shareholders Agreement) providing for, among other things, a cap on share ownership, a minimum holding period and a standstill provision and voting restrictions that effectively limit the trustee's voting rights to no more than 20% of the voting rights of the Parent Company and further restrict the trustee's voting rights with respect to certain change in control transactions. The terms of the investment do not provide Japan Post Holdings with a right to a board seat on the Parent Company's board of directors or with any other rights to control, manage or intervene in the management of the Parent Company. This strategic investment is subject to certain regulatory approvals in Japan, and the U.S. The Company anticipates that regulatory approvals will be received in the second half of 2019. The foregoing summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Basic Agreement and Letter Agreement, including the forms of Trust Agreement and Shareholders Agreement attached to the Letter Agreement, copies of which are included as Exhibits 10.47 and 10.48 attached hereto and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1. Business

U.S.
As of December 31, 2018, the U.S. sales force was composed of sales associates and brokers who are licensed to sell accident and health insurance. Many are also licensed to sell life insurance. Aflac U.S. utilizes dual-channel distribution to market its insurance products to businesses of all sizes. The career agent channel focuses on marketing Aflac to the small business market, which consists of employers with less than 100 employees. As such, Aflac U.S. has aligned its recruiting, training, compensation, marketing and incentives for its career agents to encourage specific activity and sales of individual policies in this market. The broker channel focuses on selling to the mid- and large-case market, which is comprised of employers with more than 100 employees and typically an average size of 1,000 employees or more. Since regional and national brokers have traditionally served the mid- and large-case market, the sales professionals in the broker channel are assigned a geographic market to strengthen relationships with the top brokers and sell Aflac products to their clients. As a result, Aflac U.S. is represented on 160 benefit administration platforms, sometimes referred to as exchanges, of various brokers.
Sales associates and brokers are independent contractors and are paid commissions based on first-year and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products. In addition to receiving commissions on personal production, district and regional sales coordinators may also receive override commissions and incentive bonuses. 
Aflac U.S. has continued to evolve its career and broker management infrastructure to drive growth in sales. In 2017, Aflac hired a Chief Distribution Officer to align the strategies of career and broker channels and to further expand U.S. distribution. All Aflac U.S. sales channels are now within the organizational structure of the Chief Distribution Officer. Prior to this change, the broker and career channels were part of separate organizational structures. Aflac U.S. believes the addition of this role will enhance performance management and augment its long-term sales strategy.
Aflac U.S. concentrates on marketing its insurance products at the worksite. This method offers policies to individuals through employment, trade and other associations. Historically, Aflac U.S. policies have been individually underwritten, however over the past several years, guaranteed issue options have become available. Premiums are generally paid by the employee. Additionally, Aflac's individual policies are portable, meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation, generally at the same premium. Individual policies are typically guaranteed-renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder (to age 75 for short-term disability policies). Aflac U.S. collects a major portion of premiums on such sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing. With Aflac U.S. brokerage sales expansion and CAIC, branded as Aflac Group Insurance, Aflac U.S. offers group voluntary insurance products desired by many large employers. These products are sold on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue. Worksite marketing enables sales associates and brokers to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs, compared with individually marketed business.
For additional information on Aflac's U.S. distribution, see the Aflac U.S. Segment subsection of MD&A in this report.
Competition
Japan
In 1974, Aflac was granted an operating license to sell life insurance in Japan, making Aflac the second non-Japanese life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market. Through 1981, Aflac Japan faced limited competition for cancer insurance policy sales. However, Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since Aflac Japan entered the market. The first came in the early 1980s, when nine mid-sized insurers, including domestic and foreign companies, were allowed to sell cancer insurance products for the first time. The second period began in 2001 when all life and non-life insurers were allowed to sell stand-alone cancer and medical insurance products as well as other stand-alone health insurance products. As a result, the number of insurance companies offering stand-alone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the market was deregulated in 2001. However, based on Aflac Japan's growth of annualized premiums in force and diversified distribution network, the Company does not believe that Aflac Japan's market-leading position has been significantly impacted by increased competition. Furthermore, the Company believes the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow Aflac Japan to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers. Aflac Japan is the largest life insurer in Japan in terms of cancer and medical policies in force. As of December 31, 2018, Aflac Japan exceeded 24 million individual policies in force in Japan.
Aflac Japan has experienced substantial success selling cancer policies in Japan, with more than 15 million cancer policies in force as of December 31, 2018. Aflac Japan continued to be the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan throughout 2018. The Company believes Aflac Japan will remain a leading provider of cancer insurance 
Item 1. Business

coverage in Japan, principally due to its experience in the market, well-known brand, low-cost operations, expansive marketing system and product expertise. Further, the Company believes that its alliance with Japan Post will continue to benefit Aflac Japan's sales of cancer insurance in Japan. (See Distribution-Japan above for more information on Aflac Japan's marketing system and its alliance with Japan Post.)
Aflac Japan has also experienced substantial success selling medical insurance in Japan. While other companies have recognized the opportunities that Aflac Japan has seen in the medical insurance market and are frequently offering new products, Aflac Japan endeavors to keep its products attractive to consumers by revising benefits of medical insurance products more frequently than cancer insurance. 
U.S.
Aflac U.S. competes against several voluntary supplemental insurance carriers on a national and regional basis. Aflac U.S. believes its policies, premium rates, platforms, value-added services and sales commissions are competitive by product type. Moreover, Aflac U.S. believes that its products are distinct from competitive offerings given its product focus (including features, benefits, and its claims service model), distribution capabilities, and brand awareness. For many companies with which Aflac U.S. competes, voluntary supplemental insurance products are sold as a secondary business. A growing number of major medical and life insurance carriers are also entering into the voluntary supplemental insurance market. For Aflac U.S., supplemental insurance products are its primary business and are sold via a distribution network of independent sales associates and brokers (see U.S. Distribution above). In addition, the Company believes that advertising campaigns for Aflac U.S. have increased name awareness and understanding among consumers and businesses of the value its products provide.
Both private and publicly-traded insurers offer major medical insurance for hospitalization and medical expenses. Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis to accounts that are both fully and self-insured. The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various programs. Major medical insurance generally covers a substantial portion of the medical expenses incurred by an insured. Aflac policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements major medical insurance by paying cash directly to the policyholder to use for expenses their major medical insurance is not designed to cover, or for any other uses that the policyholder chooses. Thus, Aflac U.S. does not compete directly with major medical insurers except those who sell supplemental insurance products as a secondary business. Any reduction of coverage, increase in employee participation costs, or increased deductibles and copayments by major medical commercial or government insurance carriers could favorably affect Aflac U.S. business opportunities. Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) beginning in 2010, some employers have shifted a larger burden of the cost of care to their employees, primarily through increases in premiums, copays, and/or deductibles, such as through the use of high-deductible health plans. In addition, the Company believes that some employers have made increasing use of supplemental insurance product offerings in order to improve their competitiveness in employee recruitment and retention. 
 Since Aflac products provide an additional level of financial protection for policyholders, the Company believes the increased financial exposure some employees may face creates a favorable opportunity for Aflac U.S. products. However, given the profitability erosion some major medical carriers are facing in their core lines of business, the Company has seen a more competitive landscape as they seek entry into Aflac's supplemental product segments and leverage their core benefit offerings by bundling and discounting products in order to gain voluntary market share.
One Day PaySM is a claims initiative that Aflac U.S. introduced in 2015 to process, approve and pay eligible claims in just one day. The Company believes that along with its brand and relevant products, this claims practice has helped Aflac stand out from competitors.
Investments
Effective January 1, 2018, investments of Aflac U.S. as well as certain sub-advised assets of Aflac Japan, are managed by the Company’s U.S. asset management subsidiary, Aflac Asset Management LLC (AAM), and investments of Aflac Japan are managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between Aflac Japan and the Company's asset management subsidiary in Japan, Aflac Asset Management Japan Ltd. (AAMJ). AAMJ is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is subject to rules of the Japan Investment Advisors Association, a self-regulatory organization with mandatory membership for Japan investment managers. Beginning with the first quarter of 2018, AAM and AAMJ are reported in the "Corporate and other segment" category; however, the assets that they manage will be reported in the respective Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. business segments. 
Item 1. Business

Japan
The Company’s investment strategy with respect to Aflac Japan utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking diversification, long-term risk-adjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives, as well as preserving shareholder value in the Aflac Japan business. 
In attempting to optimally balance these objectives, the Company seeks to maintain on behalf of Aflac Japan a diversified portfolio of yen-denominated investment assets, U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio hedged back to yen and a portfolio of unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated assets. Each of these portfolios presents unique benefits and risks to the Company.
Yen-denominated investments included in Aflac Japan’s portfolio primarily consist of Japan Government Bonds (JGB), other public bonds and private placement fixed income instruments. The Company attempts to match both the duration and currency of these assets with Aflac Japan’s liabilities. This poses a difficulty in Aflac Japan due to the lack of suitable long-dated yen-denominated fixed income instruments. In 2012, the Company initiated a strategic approach to include U.S. dollar-denominated investments in Aflac Japan’s portfolio with the initial intent that they would be coupled with foreign exchange hedges. Today, this hedged U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio is mainly invested in long-term fixed and floating-rate loans and long-term investment-grade fixed income securities. The primary goals of the yen-denominated and hedged U.S. dollar portfolios are to provide sufficient yen cash flows to support the insurance liabilities and other yen-denominated obligations of Aflac Japan, and to seek appropriate long-term risk-adjusted investment returns supportive of solvency margin ratio (SMR) levels that provide sufficient dividend flows to the Parent Company. The hedges supporting this portion of the U.S. dollar portfolio pose derivative rollover risk that could amplify hedge costs in unfavorable market conditions, risk of counterparty default, and may require the Company to post collateral. In a declining yen environment, these hedges could result in negative cash settlements that may significantly increase liquidity requirements, thereby shifting funds away from other capital management opportunities including loss of investment income. If the combined yen-denominated and hedged U.S. dollar-denominated portfolios are larger than Aflac Japan's yen obligations, the economic value of these portfolios may be eroded under a long-term scenario of weakening yen due to foreign currency translation risk, one result of which may be to reduce the Company's dividend capacity. 
The Company also maintains an unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio with the objectives of generating enhanced investment returns and mitigating certain of the risks posed by the yen and hedged U.S. dollar-denominated portfolios as outlined above. Further, the Company has determined that the unhedged portfolio acts as a natural economic currency hedge of a portion of the Company’s investment in Aflac Japan against erosion of economic value. However, the unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio creates an unmatched foreign currency exposure and subjects Aflac Japan to volatility in regulatory capital and earnings, which may adversely impact Aflac Japan’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company. The Company’s approach to sizing the unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio seeks to balance the unique risks presented by each of the three portfolios outlined above, but the overall investment strategy in Aflac Japan is guided primarily by the objective of securing the long-term financial strength of Aflac Japan and funding of yen liabilities. As a result, the Company has historically maintained and currently maintains the size of the unhedged portfolio at levels below the stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan. 
The determination of stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan involves multiple models using multiple statistical approaches and assuming various economic and operating scenarios that are stressed to arrive at a range of potential outcomes. This range does not account for all economic scenarios, some of which may result in values outside of the range. The Company periodically assesses the stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan, which fluctuates over time, and adjusts the size of the unhedged portfolio accordingly. The portfolio may include medium-term and long-term fixed-rate government and corporate (investment-grade and high-yield) bonds, floating-rate loans, public equities, and alternative asset classes. In determining the composition of the portfolio, the Company also considers diversification, hedge cost, investment returns relative to yen-denominated investment yields, and Aflac Japan capital requirements. At December 31, 2018, this unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio was approximately $14.4 billion, compared with approximately $13.0 billion at December 31, 2017. For additional discussion of business and market risks associated with the Company’s investment strategy in Japan, refer to the Risk Factors and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk sections.
U.S.
The Company’s investment strategy with respect to Aflac U.S. utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking long-term risk-adjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives. As part of the Company's portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac U.S. invests in fixed-maturity investments and growth assets, including public equities and alternative investments in limited partnerships. 
Item 1. Business

Aflac U.S. has been investing in both publicly traded and privately originated investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities and loans.

Regulation
Japan
The financial and business affairs of Aflac Japan are subject to examination by Japan's FSA. Aflac Japan files annual reports and financial statements for the Japanese insurance operations based on a March 31 fiscal year end, prepared in accordance with Japanese regulatory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the FSA. Japanese regulatory basis earnings are determined using accounting principles that differ materially from U.S. GAAP. For example, under Japanese regulatory accounting practices, policy acquisition costs are expensed immediately; policy benefit and claim reserving methods and assumptions are different; premium income is recognized on a cash basis; different consolidation criteria apply to variable interest entities (VIEs); different accounting applies to reinsurance; and investments can have a separate accounting classification and treatment referred to as policy reserve matching bonds (PRM), which are recorded at amortized cost. Capital and surplus of Aflac Japan, based on Japanese regulatory accounting practices, was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $6.7 billion at December 31, 2017. 
The FSA maintains a solvency standard, which is used by Japanese regulators to monitor the financial strength of insurance companies. As of December 31, 2018, Aflac Japan's SMR was 965%, compared with 1,064% at December 31, 2017. Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread and foreign exchange rate changes. See the Capital Resources and Liquidity Section of MD&A for a discussion of measures the Company has taken to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR. 
Prior to April 1, 2018, Aflac Japan repatriated a portion of its accumulated earnings, as determined on a Japanese regulatory accounting basis, to Aflac U.S. provided that Aflac Japan has determined that it adequately protected policyholders' interests as measured by its SMR. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, Aflac Japan distributes dividends to the Parent Company. Such dividends are subject to permitted dividend capacity under the Japan Company Law. 
The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. For additional information regarding the policyholder protection fund, see the Policyholder Protection subsection of MD&A in this report.
In June 2013, a revision to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act established a post-funded Orderly Resolution Regime for financial institutions to prevent a financial crisis in the event of a financial institution’s failure. This regime came into effect in March 2014 and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's operations in Japan.
For additional information regarding Aflac Japan's operations and regulations, see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MD&A and Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.
U.S.
General
The Parent Company and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries, Aflac (a Nebraska-domiciled insurance company), American Family Life Assurance Company of New York (Aflac New York, a New York-domiciled insurance company), CAIC (redomiciled from South Carolina to Nebraska effective December 2016) and Tier One Insurance Company (TOIC, an Oklahoma-domiciled shell insurance company acquired by the Parent Company in 2017 with no operations) are subject to state regulations in the United States as an insurance holding company system. Such regulations generally provide that transactions between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. In addition, transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from insurance subsidiaries, and material transactions between companies within the system, including management fees, loans and advances are subject to prior notice to, or approval by, state regulatory authorities. These laws generally require, among other things, the insurance holding company and each insurance company directly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance departments of their respective domiciliary states and to furnish annually financial and other information about the 
Item 1. Business

operations of companies within the holding company system.
Like all U.S. insurance companies, Aflac, Aflac New York, CAIC and TOIC are subject to regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. In general, the insurance laws of the various jurisdictions establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to, among other things:

• | granting and revoking licenses to transact business


• | regulating trade and claims practices


• | licensing of insurance agents and brokers


• | approval of policy forms and premium rates


• | standards of solvency and maintenance of specified policy benefit reserves and minimum loss ratio requirements


• | capital requirements


• | limitations on dividends to shareholders


• | the nature of and limitations on investments


• | deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders


• | filing of financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory insurance accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities


• | periodic examinations of the market conduct, financial, and other affairs of insurance companies

The insurance laws of Nebraska that govern Aflac's activities provide that the acquisition or change of “control” of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. A person seeking to acquire control, directly or indirectly, of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company (in the case of Aflac, the Parent Company) must generally file with the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NDOI) an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to Aflac. In Nebraska, control is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, acquires 10% or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company. The 10% presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10%. Similar laws apply in New York, the domiciliary jurisdiction of Aflac's New York insurance subsidiary.
State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). In 2016, full-scope, risk-focused financial examinations were conducted by the NDOI, New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and the South Carolina Department of Insurance (SCDOI) on their state domiciled insurance entities American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus, American Family Life Assurance Company of New York, and Continental American Insurance Company, respectively. The NDOI and NYDFS exams covered a four-year period ending December 31, 2015, whereas the SCDOI exam covered a five-year period ending December 31, 2015. There were no material findings contained in the NDOI, NYDFS and SCDOI final exam reports. 
The NAIC continually reviews regulatory matters, such as risk-based capital (RBC) modernization, group capital calculations, liquidity risk assessment and principle-based reserving. The NAIC has adopted a valuation manual containing a principle-based approach to calculation of life insurance reserves. The valuation manual became effective January 1, 2017. There is a three-year transition period, beginning January 1, 2017, during which companies can choose on a product by product basis to implement principle-based reserving for new business. The Company anticipates that the adoption of this manual will not cause a material impact on the statutory reserves of Aflac, Aflac New York or CAIC. The NAIC uses an RBC formula relating to insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurer's operations. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC as defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The levels are company action, regulatory action, authorized control, and mandatory control. As of December 31, 2018, based on year-end statutory accounting results, Aflac's company action level RBC ratio was 560%. The 2018 RBC as filed is lower than Aflac U.S. stand-alone RBC due to the inclusion of Aflac Japan for the first quarter of 2018. The RBC charge reflects the business risk without any total adjusted capital (TAC). Aflac's NAIC RBC ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position. 
Item 1. Business

Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, the Company is subject to assessments, based on the share of business the Company writes in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. In the United States, some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. The Company's policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile's statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. For additional information regarding state insurance guaranty assessments, see the U.S. Regulatory Environment subsection of MD&A in this report.
Healthcare Reform Legislation
Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including health care reform legislation, financial services reform legislation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation, can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. For example, the ACA, federal health care reform legislation, gave the U.S. federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance. The reform included major changes to the U.S. health care insurance marketplace. Among other changes, the reform legislation included an individual medical insurance coverage mandate (which has since been repealed effective 2019 by the Tax Act, discussed below), provided for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage, created health insurance exchanges, and addressed coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios. It also imposed an excise tax on certain high cost plans, known as the “Cadillac tax,” that is currently scheduled to begin in 2022. The legislation also included changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and altered federal and state regulation of health insurers. The ACA, as enacted, does not require material changes in the design of the Company's insurance products. However, indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges that could potentially have an impact on the Company's sales model, financial condition and results of operations. The United States Congress has considered and may continue to consider legislation that would repeal and replace key provisions of the ACA. There can be no assurance that any legislation affecting the ACA will be passed by Congress, nor as to the ultimate timing or provisions of any such legislation, nor as to the effect of any such legislation on the design or marketability of the Company's insurance products. Further, certain provisions of the ACA have been and may continue to be subject to challenge through litigation, the ultimate effects of which on the ACA are uncertain.
Tax Reform Legislation
A budget reconciliation act commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Job Act (Tax Act) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among other things, effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated or reduced certain deductions and credits, and limited the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation.
The Tax Act also transitions international corporate taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system, which in light of the current tax treatment of Aflac Japan has the effect of subjecting the earnings of Aflac Japan to Japan taxation and subjecting the Company’s other earnings, including the consolidated earnings of the Parent Company, to U.S. taxation. 
These changes were effective on January 1, 2018. Because changes to tax rates are accounted for in the period of enactment, during the period ended December 31, 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded, as the Company’s reasonable estimate, a net deferred tax liability reduction of $1.9 billion as of that date. As of the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an immaterial adjustment to the provisional amount of deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) related to the Japan tax computation and no valuation allowance adjustment related to anticipatory foreign tax credit asset, rendering final values for the Company's deferred tax liability. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. For information on the conversion of Aflac Japan from a branch to a subsidiary, see General Business under this Business section, above.
Item 1. Business

Dodd-Frank Act
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) and regulations issued thereunder, in particular rules to require central clearing for certain types of derivatives, may have an impact on Aflac's derivative activity, including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan. In addition, in 2015 and 2016, six U.S. financial regulators, including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), issued final rules regarding the exchange of initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) for uncleared swaps that impose greater obligations on swap dealers regarding uncleared swaps with certain counterparties, such as Aflac. The requirements of such rules with respect to VM, as well as similar regulations in Europe, became effective on March 1, 2017. Full compliance with respect to all counterparties was required by September 1, 2017. The requirements of such rules with respect to IM are currently being phased in and will be fully implemented by September 1, 2020. In October of 2017, the CFTC and the European Commission each finalized comparability determinations that permit certain swap dealers who are subject to both regulatory margin regimes to take advantage of substituted compliance by complying with one set of margin requirements. The margin requirements are expected to result in more stringent collateral requirements and to affect other aspects of Aflac's derivatives activity.
The Dodd-Frank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) under the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of business lines other than certain health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance. Traditionally, U.S. insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments. The FIO does not directly regulate the insurance industry, but under Dodd-Frank it has the power to preempt state insurance regulations that are inconsistent with international agreements reached by the federal government, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. The FIO and certain federal agencies must achieve consensus positions with the state insurance regulators when taking positions on insurance proposals by certain international forums. In December 2013, the FIO released a report entitled "How To Modernize And Improve The System Of Insurance Regulation In The United States." The report was required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and included 18 recommended areas of near-term reform for the states, including addressing capital adequacy and safety/soundness issues, reform of insurer resolution practices, and reform of marketplace regulation. The report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation. Some of the recommendations outlined in the FIO report released in December 2013 have been implemented. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, signed into law in January 2015, simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines. The FIO has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers.
The current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have made recent attempts to reform or repeal certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, some of which have been implemented. For example, in 2018, President Trump signed into law the “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.” Members of Congress have also introduced multiple bills that would impact or eliminate the FIO. The Federal Reserve is developing a rulemaking regarding the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (the Council) ability to designate nonbank financial companies as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, and, pursuant to an Executive Order, the Treasury Department released a report on the Council’s designation authority. The Company cannot predict with any degree of certainty what impact, if any, such proposals will have on Aflac's business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Privacy and Cybersecurity
The collection, maintenance, use, protection, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by the Company's businesses are regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation. Various state laws address the unauthorized access and acquisition of personal information and the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). For example, in June 2018, California passed a data privacy law, scheduled to become effective January 2020, that requires businesses to provide California consumers rights to access, delete, and restrict certain uses of their personal information. HIPAA also requires that the Company imposes privacy and security requirements on its business associates (as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). With regard to personal information obtained from policyholders, the insured, or others, Aflac Japan is 
Item 1. Business

regulated in Japan by the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) and guidelines issued by FSA and other governmental authorities. The FSA updated its guidelines regarding cybersecurity in October 2018.
Cybersecurity also continues to be an area of evolving focus for U.S. legislation and regulatory activity. In March 2017, new cybersecurity regulation issued by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) went into effect that requires covered entities, including Aflac New York, to maintain an information security program meeting certain security, data disposal, audit, activity monitoring, and data encryption requirements. In October 2017, the NAIC adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law that may be adopted in whole or in part by U.S. states in which the Company’s subsidiaries are licensed. Other states have adopted and, the Company expects, will continue to pass legislation and issue regulations related to cybersecurity. The Company anticipates, assesses, and if necessary modifies its information security program to accommodate such changes. 
The Company’s Board of Directors has adopted an information security policy directing management to establish and operate an information security program with the goal of ensuring that the Company’s information assets and data, and the data of its customers, are appropriately protected. The Board has delegated oversight of the Company’s information security program to the Audit and Risk Committee. The Company’s senior officers, including its Global Security and Chief Information Security Officer, are responsible for the operation of the information security program and regularly communicate with the Audit and Risk Committee on the program, including with respect to the state of the program, compliance with applicable regulations, current and evolving threats, and recommendations for changes in the information security program. The information security program also includes a cybersecurity incident response plan that is designed to provide a management framework across Company functions for a coordinated assessment and response to potential security incidents. This framework establishes a protocol to report certain incidents to the Global Security and Chief Information Security Officer and other senior officers, with the goal of timely assessing such incidents, determining applicable disclosure requirements and communicating with the Audit and Risk Committee. The incident response plan directs the executive officers to report certain incidents immediately and directly to the Lead Non-Management Director.
Other Operations
The Company's other operations include the Parent Company, results of reinsurance retrocession activities, and a printing subsidiary. For additional information on the Company's other operations, see the Corporate and Other subsection of MD&A and Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Aflac Japan had 6,121 employees, Aflac U.S. had 4,712 employees, and the Company's other operations had 557 employees.
