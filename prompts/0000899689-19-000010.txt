ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.4% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2018.

We currently own all or portions of:

New York:


• | 19.9 million square feet of Manhattan office in 36 properties;


• | 2.6 million square feet of Manhattan street retail in 71 properties;


• | 1,999 units in eleven residential properties;


• | The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33rd Street in the heart of the Penn District; and


• | A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building.

Other Real Estate and Related Investments:


• | The 3.7 million square foot theMART in Chicago;


• | A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating 1.8 million square feet, known as the Bank of America Center;


• | A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate fund (the "Fund"). We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund; and


• | Other real estate and other investments.

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

• | maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;


• | investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;


• | acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;


• | investing in retail properties in select under-stored locations such as the New York City metropolitan area;


• | developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and


• | investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.


We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

The joint venture has entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders pursuant to which they will build the Moynihan Train Hall, thereby fulfilling all of the joint venture's obligations to ESD. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. The development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall are estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, which will be funded by governmental agencies. Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 840-40-55, the joint venture, which we consolidate on our consolidated balance sheets, is required to recognize all development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall.

Upon completion of the development, the "Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures" and the offsetting “Moynihan Train Hall obligation” will be removed from our consolidated balance sheets.
