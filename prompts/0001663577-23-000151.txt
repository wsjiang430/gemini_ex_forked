ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We aim to be a global leader in the manufacture and assembly of industrial equipment and precision engineered technology for the Industrial, Oil & Gas, and Utility sectors.
 
We changed ownership on the 28th of May 2022, when, Ilustrato Pictures International Inc. (“ILUS”) acquired 77.4 % of the outstanding shares in our Company. Consequently, ILUS is now able to unilaterally control the election of our board of directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, ultimately, the direction of our Company. Also, during the year, Mr. Nicholas Link, beneficial owner of ILUS, was appointed as our Chairman of the Board, Mr. John-Paul Blackwell was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Carsten Falk was appointed as our Chief Commercial Officer.
 
In line with the change in control and business direction, our Company changed its name to Quality Industrial Corp. with the ticker QIND, with a market effective date of August 4, 2022. As a result of these transactions, Quality Industrial Corp. is now a public company focused on the Industrial, Oil & Gas and Utility Sectors and a subsidiary to ILUS.
 
On March 9, 2023, we changed our SIC code of the Company to SIC 3590 – Misc. Industrial & Commercial Machinery and Equipment to reflect the new business direction.
 
Quality International Co Ltd FCZ
 
After ILUS acquired control, on June 30, 2022, it signed a binding Letter of Intent for our Company to acquire a controlling interest in Quality International Co Ltd FCZ (“QI”), an international process manufacturing company, manufacturing custom solutions for the Oil and Gas, Power/Energy, Water, Desalination, Wastewater and Offshore sectors. It has several required industry certifications in place and is on several global preferred vendor lists, with customers including but not limited to BP, Shell, Total, Chevron, Sonatrach, Sasol and Gasco.
 
To fund the first tranche of the purchase price for the interest in QI, on August 3, 2022, we issued to an accredited investor a two-year convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $1,100,000 (the “Note”). The Note bears interest at 7% per annum. We have the right to prepay the Note at any time. All principal on the Note is convertible into shares of our common stock after six months from issuance at the election of the holder at a conversion price equal $1.00 per share.
 
The Binding Letter of Intent with QI contemplated a period of due diligence followed by entry into a Stock Purchase Agreement. On January 18, 2023, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with the shareholders of Quality Industrial, which agreement provided for our purchase of 78 of the 150 outstanding shares of QI for a 52% interest in the company. The Shares will be held by a company in Dubai called “Quality Industries Holding Ltd.,” a freezone company under the regulations of Abu Dhabi General Markets and laws of United Arab Emirates. This entity will be our wholly owned subsidiary. All closing documents were executed for the transaction on March 6, 2023.
 
The purchase price for the Shares shall be up to $137,000,000 in cash, paid in tranches, subject to achievement of financial milestones presented in a schedule of payments set forth in the Purchase Agreement filed with this Form 10-K and displayed in the table set below:

The Purchase Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants whereby the shareholders selling the Shares are prohibited from (a) competing with the business of the Company, (b) soliciting employees of the Company and (c) intentionally interfering with the Company’s business relationships, in each case during the two-year period immediately following the Closing.
 
Following its acquisition by our Company, QI will continue its operations as a process manufacturer and the Company plans to continue acquiring businesses in the Industrial and Manufacturing Sectors.
 
Shareholders’ Agreement
 
As a condition of the Purchase Agreement, we have entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement with the other two Shareholders of QI to, among other things, establish the governance of QI, restrictions on share transfers, the financing of QI going forward and to govern disputes among Shareholders.
 
We shall occupy two non-paid board seats of QI. There is another board seat for existing QI shareholders. A final independent board seat is to be chosen by us and the existing Shareholders. Within fifteen (15) months from the date of the SPA, we will assist the newly created board by arranging up to $100,000,000 USD in the form of debt financing to be secured against the financials of QI, for the benefit of QI’s execution of long-term orders and projects and to meet the cashflow requirements of QI.

On April 16, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with WikiSoft Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation which was then the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) and WikiSoft Corp., a privately held Delaware corporation (“WikiSoft DE”). In connection with the closing of this merger transaction, Merger Sub merged with and into WikiSoft DE (the “Merger”) on April 30, 2019. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company acquired WikiSoft DE which then became its wholly owned subsidiary.
 
On March 19, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Short Form Merger Agreement”) with WikiSoft DE, pursuant to which it was agreed that the Company would merge with and into WikiSoft DE, with the Company surviving. Thereafter, on March 25, 2020, WikiSoft DE merged with and into the Company, with the Company (i.e. Wikisoft Corp. - the NV corporation) surviving pursuant to a Certificate of Ownership and Merger filed in with Delaware Secretary of State, whereby the then wholly owned subsidiary (WikiSoft DE) merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving. On March 25, 2020, the Company filed Articles of Conversion in Nevada, whereby the then subsidiary (WikiSoft DE) merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving.

Our common stock trades under the symbol “QIND.”
 
On March 9, 2023, we changed our SIC code of the Company to SIC 3590 – Misc. Industrial & Commercial Machinery and Equipment to reflect the new business direction.
 
Smaller Reporting Company
 
The Company is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a “smaller reporting company”, these exemptions will continue to be available to us.
Emerging Growth Company
 
The Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, it may choose to follow disclosure requirements that are scaled for newly public companies. A company qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8, 2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement.
 
For so long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” In particular, as an emerging growth company we:
 

· | are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis”); 
· | are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes); 
· | are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 
· | may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”); and 
· | are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act 


14
--


Under the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if we have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our Common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the last day of the fiscal year following the date of the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity securities under an effective registration statement or a fiscal year in which we have $1 billion in gross revenues.
 
We intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Therefore, our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.
 
        Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
