ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Historical DuPont was founded in 1802 and was incorporated in Delaware in 1915. Today, Historical DuPont is helping customers find solutions to capitalize on areas of growing global demand — enabling more, safer, nutritious food; creating high-performance, cost-effective and energy efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and increasingly delivering renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. Total worldwide employment at December 31, 2018 was about 44,000 people. The company has subsidiaries in about 90 countries worldwide and manufacturing operations in about 50 countries. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the location of the company's sales and property.
DowDuPont Merger of Equals
DowDuPont Inc. ("DowDuPont") was formed on December 9, 2015 to effect an all-stock, merger of equals strategic combination between The Dow Chemical Company ("Historical Dow") and Historical DuPont (the "Merger Transaction"). On August 31, 2017 at 11:59 pm ET, (the "Merger Effectiveness Time") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), Historical Dow and Historical DuPont each merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont ("Mergers") and, as a result of the Mergers, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (collectively, the "Merger"). Prior to the Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
As a condition of the regulatory approval for the Merger Transaction, the company was required to divest certain assets related to its crop protection business and research and development ("R&D") organization, specifically the company’s Cereal Broadleaf Herbicides and Chewing Insecticides portfolios, including Rynaxypyr®, Cyazypyr® , and Indoxacarb as well as the Crop Protection R&D pipeline and organization, excluding seed treatment, nematicides, and late-stage R&D programs (the "Divested Ag Business"). On March 31, 2017, the company entered into a definitive agreement (the "FMC Transaction Agreement") with FMC Corporation ("FMC"). Under the FMC Transaction Agreement, and effective upon the closing of the transaction on November 1, 2017, FMC acquired the Divested Ag Business that Historical DuPont was required to divest in order to obtain European Commission ("EC") approval for the Merger Transaction, and Historical DuPont acquired certain assets relating to FMC’s Health and Nutrition segment (the "H&N Business") (collectively, the "FMC Transactions"). On November 1, 2017, the company completed the FMC Transactions through the disposition of the Divested Ag Business and the acquisition of the Acquired H&N Business. See Note 3 and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the acquisition and divestiture, respectively. The sale of the Divested Ag Business meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings are included within income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. 
DowDuPont has announced its intent to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of Directors of DowDuPont and customary closing conditions, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and materials science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the "Intended Business Separations" and the transactions to accomplish the Intended Business Separations, the “separations”). DowDuPont anticipates materials science separating about April 1, 2019, and expects agriculture and specialty products to separate about June 1, 2019. 
Basis of Presentation
For purposes of DowDuPont's financial statement presentation, Historical Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger and Historical DuPont's assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value as of the Merger Effectiveness Time. In connection with the Merger and the related accounting determination, Historical DuPont has elected to apply push-down accounting and reflect in its financial statements, the fair value of its assets and liabilities. Historical DuPont's Consolidated Financial Statements for periods following the close of the Merger are labeled “Successor” and reflect DowDuPont’s basis in the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Historical DuPont. All periods prior to the closing of the Merger reflect the historical accounting basis in Historical DuPont's assets and liabilities and are labeled “Predecessor.” The Consolidated Financial Statements and Footnotes include a black line division between the columns titled "Predecessor" and "Successor" to signify that the amounts shown for the periods prior to and following the Merger are not comparable. In addition, the company has elected to make certain changes in presentation to harmonize its accounting and reporting with that of DowDuPont in the Successor periods. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these changes and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Merger.

The Intended Business Separations
DowDuPont has formed two wholly owned subsidiaries: Dow Holdings Inc., to serve as a holding company for its materials science business, and Corteva, Inc., to serve as a holding company for its agriculture business.
In furtherance of the Intended Business Separations, DowDuPont is engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps (the “Internal Reorganization”) to realign its businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. As part of the Internal Reorganization, the assets and liabilities aligned with the materials science business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of Dow Holdings Inc. and the assets and liabilities aligned with the agriculture business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of Corteva Inc. 
Following the Internal Reorganization, DowDuPont expects to distribute its materials science and agriculture businesses through two separate U.S. federal tax-free spin-offs in which DowDuPont stockholders, at the time of such spin-offs, will receive a pro rata dividend of the shares of the capital stock of Dow Holdings Inc. and of Corteva, Inc., as applicable (the “distributions”). The materials science business after the consummation of the applicable Internal Reorganization will be referred to as “Dow” and the agriculture business after the consummation of the applicable Internal Reorganization will be referred to as “Corteva”. Following the separation and distribution of Dow, which is targeted to occur on April 1, 2019, DowDuPont, as the remaining company, will continue to hold the agriculture and specialty products businesses. DowDuPont is then targeted to complete the separation and distribution of Corteva on June 1, 2019, resulting in DowDuPont holding the specialty products businesses of the combined Company. After the distribution of Corteva, it is expected that DowDuPont will become known as "DuPont". Historical DuPont after the separations and distributions will hold the agriculture business and be a subsidiary of Corteva Inc.
Agriculture Reporting Unit Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Asset Impairments 
During the third quarter of 2018, the company was required to perform an interim impairment test of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the agriculture reporting unit. As a result of the analysis performed, the company recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $4,503 million for goodwill and $85 million for certain indefinite-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges were recognized in goodwill impairment charge and restructuring and asset related charges - net, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
DowDuPont Contribution and Historical DuPont’s Offer to Purchase Debt Securities
On November 13, 2018, Historical DuPont launched a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debt securities (the “Tender Notes”). At December 1, 2018, the expiration date for the Tender Offer, $4,409 million aggregate principal amount of the Tender Notes had been validly tendered and was accepted for payment. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 18 of this report and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted.  The Act reduces the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax (“transition tax”) on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system. At December 31, 2017, the company had not yet completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of The Act. However, the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ("SAB 118"), income tax effects of The Act were refined upon obtaining, preparing, or analyzing additional information during the measurement period. At December 31, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act. Additional details related to The Act can be found in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 18 of this report and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program
In September and November 2017, DowDuPont and the company approved post-merger restructuring actions to achieve targeted cost synergies under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The Synergy Program is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Intended Business Separations. Based on all actions approved to date under the Synergy Program, Historical DuPont expects to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of $575 million to $675 million, comprised of approximately $370 million to $400 million of severance and related benefits costs; $80 million to $100 million of costs related to contract terminations; and $125 million to $175 million of asset related charges. The company anticipates including savings associated with these actions within DowDuPont's cost synergy commitment of $3.6 billion associated with the Merger Transaction. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 18 of this report and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2017 Restructuring Program
During the first quarter 2017, Historical DuPont committed to take actions to improve plant productivity and better position its product lines for productivity and growth before and after the anticipated closing of the Merger Transaction (the "2017 restructuring program"). In connection with these actions, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $313 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charge is comprised of $279 million of asset related charges and $34 million in severance and related benefit costs. These charges primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the safety and construction product line at the Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South Carolina. The asset related charges mainly consist of accelerated depreciation associated with the closure. The actions associated with this plan are substantially complete. The company anticipates including savings associated with these actions within the targeted cost synergies associated with the Merger Transaction. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 18 of this report and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Spin-off of Performance Chemicals
On July 1, 2015, Historical DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company. In connection with the separation, the company and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), the results of operations of its former Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Additional details regarding the separation and other related agreements can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Segment Information
Effective with the Merger, Historical DuPont’s business activities are components of its parent company’s business operations. Historical DuPont’s business activities, including the assessment of performance and allocation of resources, are reviewed and managed by DowDuPont. Information used by the chief operating decision maker of Historical DuPont relates to the company in its entirety. Accordingly, there are no separate reportable business segments for Historical DuPont under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280 “Segment Reporting” and Historical DuPont's business results are reported in this Form 10-K as a single operating segment.
Principal Product Information 
Subsidiaries and affiliates of Historical DuPont conduct manufacturing, seed production and/or selling activities and some are distributors of products manufactured by the company. The following describes the company’s principal product lines including major brands and technologies:

Principal Markets
The company's principal markets include: agriculture, automotive and transportation, packaging for food and beverages, electrical/electronic components, material handling, healthcare, construction, semiconductor, aerospace/aircraft, dietary supplements, specialty food ingredients, food nutrition, health and safety, industrial, consumer electronics, photovoltaics, displays, consumer, military and law enforcement, aircraft, energy, animal nutrition, detergents, food and beverage, carpet and apparel fiber.
Sources and Availability of Major Raw Materials
The company utilizes numerous suppliers as well as internal sources to supply a wide range of raw materials, energy, supplies, services and equipment. To ensure availability, the company maintains multiple sources for fuels and many raw materials, including hydrocarbon feedstocks. Large volume purchases are generally procured under competitively priced supply contracts.
The following are the company's major commodities, raw materials and supplies: 
Corn and soybean seeds, soy white flakes, soybean, adipic acid, hexamethylene diamine, meta-phenylene diamine, terephthaloyl chloride, ethane, thermoplastic polyester elastomer and thermoplastic copolyester elastomer.
Competition 
As a science and technology based company, Historical DuPont competes on a variety of factors such as product quality and performance or specifications, continuity of supply, price, customer service and breadth of product line, depending on the characteristics of the particular market involved and the product or service provided. The company competes globally with other seed and plant biotechnology companies on the basis of technology and trait leadership, price, quality and cost competitiveness. Key competitors for the company's agriculture product line include BASF, Bayer and ChemChina, as well as regional seed companies. The company's remaining product lines compete with many companies depending on the applicable market segment; peer multi-industrial competitors include The 3M Company and Honeywell.
Distribution 
Most products are marketed primarily through the company's sales organization, although in some regions, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers and farmers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world. In the corn and soybean markets of the U.S. Corn Belt, the company sells Pioneer® brand products primarily through a specialized force of independent sales representatives. Outside of North America, the company markets Pioneer® brand products primarily through a network of subsidiaries, joint ventures and independent producer-distributors. 
Seasonality
Sales of the company's agriculture product line are affected by the seasonality of global agriculture markets and weather patterns. Sales and earnings performance are significantly stronger in the first versus second half of the year, reflecting the northern hemisphere planting season. As a result of this seasonality, the agriculture product line inventory is at its highest level at the end of the calendar year and is sold down in the first and second quarters. Trade receivables for seeds are at a low point at year-end and increase through the northern hemisphere selling season to peak at the end of the second quarter.
Backlog 
In general, the company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Intellectual Property
Trade secrets are an important element of the company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make Historical DuPont products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. Historical DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the company and/or unjust enrichment.

Patents & Trademarks: Historical DuPont continually applies for and obtains U.S. and foreign patents and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. Historical DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the company in the aggregate. The protection afforded by these patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. This significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2018, the company owned about 6,500 active U.S. patents and about 10,500 active patents outside of the U.S. Information on the importance of intellectual property rights to the company’s agriculture product line is included in the Research and Development discussion below.
Remaining life of granted patents owned as of December 31, 2018:

 | Approximate U.S. | Approximate Other Countries
Within 5 years | 1,600 | | 3,100 
6 to 10 years | 2,000 | | 4,700 
11 to 16 years | 2,300 | | 2,600 
16 to 20 years | 600 | | 100 
Total | 6,500 | | 10,500

In addition to its owned patents, the company owns over 9,000 patent applications.
The company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected. 
Research and Development
Historical DuPont conducts R&D activities to renew its portfolio, create new product lines, and transform markets to deliver results in the short, mid and long term. The company protects its R&D investment through its intellectual property strategy.  See discussion under “Intellectual Property” above.
R&D expense related to the agriculture product line accounted for 56 percent of the company's total R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. R&D for the agriculture product line requires long-term commitment of resources, extensive regulatory efforts and collaborations, partnerships and business arrangements to successfully bring products to market. To protect its investment, the company employs the use of patents covering germplasm and native and biotechnology traits in accordance with country laws. The company holds multiple long-term biotechnology trait licenses from third parties as a normal course of business. The biotechnology traits licensed by the company from third parties are contained in a variety of Pioneer seeds, including corn hybrids and soybean varieties. The majority of Pioneer’s corn hybrids and soybean varieties sold to customers contain biotechnology traits licensed from third parties under these long-term licenses.
