ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
  
 Historically we have operated as a digital media holding company for online for online assets primarily targeted to the military and public safety sectors. In addition to our corporate website, we own and/or manage 25 websites which are customized to provide our niche users, including active, reserve and retired military, law enforcement, first responders and other public safety employees with products, information and news that we believe may be of interest to them. We also own an ad network which was acquired in September 2017. We have placed a particular emphasis on providing quality content on our websites to drive traffic increases. Our websites feature timely, proprietary and aggregated content covering current events and a variety of additional subjects targeted to the specific demographics of the individual website. Our business strategy requires us to continue to provide this quality content to our niche markets and to grow our business, operations and revenues both organically and through acquisitions as we expand our business past the original niche markets into mainstream digital audiences.
  
 We have invested in our infrastructure and acquisitions and placed an emphasis on providing quality content on our websites necessary to drive traffic to our websites. With the exit from our E-Commerce businesses effective December 31, 2018, we believe that we have advanced our transition to becoming a digital media company. We believe that with this action, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be positively impacted in the long term.
  
 Our advertising network matches advertisers with publishers. It offers video, display, mobile and native ads, providing focused promotion for advertisers of products and services while helping websites monetize their visitor traffic. Our advertising exchange platform is being developed to be a trading desk for publishers and advertisers where they will be able to log-in and choose from various features. Publishers will be able to select a variety of advertising units for their video, mobile, display and native advertisements and also have the ability to create their own unique advertising formats. Advertisers will be able to choose where their advertisements will be seen using our filters or by connection directly with the publisher through our platform. 
  
 We have grown our business through sales efforts including:
  
   ●
 establishing favorable contract terms with many key advertising demand parties;

   ●
 supply relationships with approximately 200 digital publishers;

   ●
 over 50 RTB clients;

   ●
 proprietary software to collect and report results for publisher clients;

   ●
 ability and software to quickly and efficiently detect fraudulent traffic; and

   ●
 highly scalable sales and ad operations functions.

 
  Bright Mountain Media Ad Network Business
  
 While we are currently accessing third party real time bidding, or “RTB,” platforms, we are currently working on the development of our own proprietary real time bidding, or “RTB,” platform, display and video ad serving software, and header bidding technology, as we move to vertically integrate higher margin software products into our ad network business model. The platform, which is the pre-Alpha stage, is being developed for us by AdsRemedy, a third party consulting firm that provides support services to us.
  
 Our new platform is expected to have a significant impact on our revenues and its capabilities will include:
  
   ●
 server integration with several ad exchanges, making for extremely quick ad deployments;

   ●
 leading targeting technology, allowing advertisers to pinpoint their marketing efforts to reach various demographics across mobile, tablet, and desktop;

   ●
 capable of handling any ad format, including video, display, and native ads;

   ●
 ad serving and self-service features; and

   ●
 ability for advertisers and publishers to conduct private deals.

 
 We believe that the exit from the E-Commerce business will have the following benefits during 2019 and beyond:
  
   ●
 allow us to concentrate all our efforts on the Ad Network, Ad Tech, and Ad software business; and

   ●
 change the digital market for young male audiences and advertisers by being the first vertically integrated publisher/ad network in our demographic.

  Our Strategy
  
 The exit from all of our E-commerce businesses at December 31, 2018 allows Bright Mountain to concentrate all of our resources to our best and fastest growing business opportunities.
  
 The Bright Mountain Media business strategy focuses on two primary elements:
  
   ●
 first, the organic growth of our existing Ad Network and owned and operated websites.

   ●
 second, the very selective acquisition of related businesses in our space that are complimentary to our growth strategy.

 
 To implement this strategy, we intend to:
  
   ●
 accelerate the organic growth of Bright Mountain Media through the addition of internally developed software products that will vertically integrate our business model through our own ad serving, header bidding and owned RTB platform which will increase sales and gross profit margins; and

   ●
 leverage our Management and Acquisition Agreement with Spartan Capital Securities, LLC (“Spartan Capital”) to help locate and introduce companies in our space that will compliment our acquisition business strategy.

 
 Currently, in addition to our corporate website, www.brightmountainmedia.com, we own the following website properties which we have acquired or developed:
  
 
● | Advertisetothemilitary.com | ● | Militaryhousingrentals.com

 We also partner on six additional websites, havokjournal.com, Article107News.com, 24HourCampFire.com, Retail Salute, ChicagoFireWire.com, and yuuut.com, under revenue sharing arrangements.
  
  Discontinued Operations
  
 Historically we generated revenues from two segments, our advertising segment and our product sales segment. Revenues from the product sales segment included revenues from two of our websites that operate as e-commerce platforms, including Bright Watches and Black Helmet, as well as Bright Watches’ retail location. During 2018 we began to de-emphasize our product sales segment as we placed more emphasis on our advertising segment. Management, prior to December 31, 2018, with the appropriate level of authority, determined to discontinue the operations of Black Helmet and Bright Watches effective December 31, 2018.
  
 The decision to exit all components of our product segment have resulted in these businesses being accounted for as discontinued operations. We recorded a loss, net of income taxes, of $1,092,750 in 2018 for the discontinued operations.
  
 Subsequent to December 31, 2018, we are aggressively marketing the remaining Bright Watches’ inventory in an effort to liquidate such inventory as quickly as possible. In addition, in March 2018 we sold the assets which were used in our Black Helmet apparel E-Commerce business to an unaffiliated third party for $175,000, of which $20,000 was paid at closing and the balance is payable under the terms of a promissory note in the principal amount of $155,000 and bearing interest at 15% per annum. The note is secured by a guarantee of the principal of the purchaser.

  Intellectual Property
  
 We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We own various service marks and trademarks, which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office including the following:
  
 “THE BRIGHT NETWORK” Design and Service Mark;
  “THEBRIGHT.COM” Logo Trade Mark and Service Mark;
  “BRIGHT MOUNTAIN” Service Mark; and
  
 In addition to www.brightmountainmedia.com and www.thebright.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future.
  
  Technology
  
 Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages and ads to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic and network growth. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party content delivery network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.
 Competition
  
 The internet and industries that operate through it are intensely competitive. We compete with other companies that have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and distribution resources. Our competitors include Verizon Media, AppNexus, The Maven, and Praetorian Digital. 
  
 Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry than we have. There are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Our websites may not be competitive with other technologies and/or our websites may be displaced by newer technology. If this happens, our sales and revenues will likely decline. In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.
  
  Government regulation
  
 Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a user’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that user, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad that focus on consumer protection or data privacy. In particular, this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other technology to collect or aggregate information about Internet users’ online browsing activity. Because we, and our clients, rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies, it is essential that we monitor developments in this area domestically and globally, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect and how we use that data to provide our services.
  
 We provide this notice through our privacy policy, which can be found on our website at http://www.BrightMountainMedia.com. As stated in our privacy policy, our technology platform does not collect information, such as name, address, or phone number, that can be used directly to identify a real person, and we take steps not to collect and store such personally identifiable information from any source. Instead, we rely on IP addresses, geo-location information, and persistent identifiers about Internet users and do not attempt to associate this data with other data that can be used to identify real people. This type of information is considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of future legislation or regulation. The definition of personal data varies by country, and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to avoid violating laws or regulations related to the collection, storage, and use of consumer data. For example, some European countries consider IP addresses or unique device identifiers to be personal data subject to heightened legal and regulatory requirements. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each country in which we do business.

 There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data relevant to our business. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), imposes restrictions on the collection and use of data about users of child-directed websites. To comply with COPPA, we have taken various steps to implement a system that: (i) flags seller-identified child-directed sites to buyers, (ii) limits advertisers’ ability to serve interest-based advertisements, (iii) helps limit the types of information that our advertisers have access to when placing advertisements on child-directed sites, and (iv) limits the data that we collect and use on such child-directed sites.
  
 The use and transfer of personal data in EU member states is currently governed under the EU Data Protection Directive, which generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. We have relied on alternative compliance measures, which are complex, which may be subject to legal challenge, and which directly subject us to regulatory enforcement by data protection authorities located in the European Union. By relying on these alternative compliance measures, we risk becoming the subject of regulatory investigations in any of the individual jurisdictions in which we operate. Each such investigation could cost us significant time and resources, and could potentially result in fines, criminal prosecution, or other penalties. Further, some of these alternative compliance measures are facing legal challenges, which, if successful, could invalidate the alternative compliance measures that we currently rely on. It may take us significant time, resources, and effort to restructure our business and/or rely on another legally sufficient compliance measure. In addition, the European Union has finalized the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which will become effective in May 2018. The GDPR sets out higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, as well as a greater compliance burden for us in the course of delivering our solution in Europe; among other requirements, the GDPR obligates companies that process large amounts of personal data about EU residents to implement a number of formal processes and policies reviewing and documenting the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. Further, the European Union is expected to replace the EU Cookie Directive governing the use of technologies to collect consumer information with the ePrivacy Regulation. The ePrivacy Regulation propose burdensome requirements around obtaining consent, and impose fines for violations that are materially higher than those imposed under the Cookie Directive.
  
 The UK's decision to leave the European Union may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts. If UK and EU privacy and data protection laws and regulations diverge, we will be required to implement alternative EU compliance measures and adapt separately to any new UK requirements.
  
 Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policy and our general consumer privacy practices are also subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations therein. Certain State Attorneys General may also bring enforcement actions based on comparable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. Outside of the United States, our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business.
  
 Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data, including the Internet Advertising Bureau ("IAB"), the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative, and the Europe Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policy about our use of cookies and other technologies to collect consumer data, and of our collection and use of consumer data to deliver interest-based advertisements. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of interest-based advertising through a mechanism on our website, linked through our privacy policy as well as through portals maintained by some of these self-regulatory bodies. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to discipline members or participants, which could result in fines, penalties, and/or public censure (which could in turn cause reputational harm). Additionally, some of these self-regulatory bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory bodies.
