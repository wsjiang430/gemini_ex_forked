Item 1.    Business.
The Company.    We are an internally managed and self-advised real estate investment trust, or REIT, primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of office buildings in the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law and we have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The Company operates as what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, conducting substantially all of its activities through EQC Operating Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the Operating Trust).
The Company beneficially owned 99.96% of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest, designated as units, in the Operating Trust (OP Units) as of December 31, 2018, and the Company is the sole trustee of the Operating Trust.  As the sole trustee, the Company generally has the power under the declaration of trust of the Operating Trust to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Trust, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of other holders of OP Units. 
At December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 10 properties, with a total of 5.1 million square feet. Over the past five years, we disposed of 158 properties and three land parcels totaling 40.7 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $5.4 billion, as well as $704.8 million of common shares of Select Income REIT. The remaining 10 properties were 94.8% leased and had 91.2% commenced occupancy as of December 31, 2018. In 2018, the Company completed seven property dispositions totaling $1.0 billion. In addition, in January 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the entity owning 1735 Market Street in Philadelphia for a gross sale price of $451.6 million. We currently have two other properties totaling 1.4 million square feet for sale.
We remain focused on creating value through proactive asset management and improving operating results, while evaluating opportunities to invest capital in high-quality assets or businesses in favorable markets that offer a compelling risk-reward profile. We have generated significant proceeds from dispositions. Since 2014, we have used these proceeds to retire $3.0 billion of debt and preferred shares and have $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2018. The set of opportunities that we pursue in the future may include acquisitions of office as well as other property types in order to create a foundation for long-term growth. Alternatively, we may decide to sell or liquidate the Company if we believe a sale or liquidation will maximize shareholder value. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 41 full-time employees. Our principal executive offices are located at Two North Riverside Plaza, Suite 2100, Chicago, Illinois 60606, our telephone number is (312) 646-2800 and our website is www.eqcre.com.

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities
The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, repositioning, disposition and financing policies. These policies are established by our Board of Trustees and may be changed by our Board of Trustees at any time without shareholder approval. 
Investment Policies.    In evaluating potential investments and asset sales, we consider various factors, including but not limited to the following:

• | the type of property;


• | the historical and projected rents received and likely to be received from the property;


• | the historical and expected operating expenses, including real estate taxes, incurred and expected to be incurred at the property;


• | the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the market in which the property is located;


• | the quality and credit worthiness of the property's tenants;


• | occupancy and demand for similar properties in the same or nearby markets;

1


• | the construction quality, physical condition and design of the property, and expected capital expenditures that may be needed to be made to the property;


• | the location of the property; and


• | the pricing of comparable properties as evidenced by recent market sales.

We have no policies which specifically limit the percentage of our assets which may be invested in any individual property, in any one type of property, in properties in one geographic area, in properties leased to any one tenant, in properties leased to an affiliated group of tenants, in real estate joint ventures, or in participating, or convertible or other types of mortgages. We have in the past provided seller financing for properties we have sold and may do so again in the future.
In the past, we have considered the possibility of entering into mergers or strategic combinations with other companies. We may undertake such considerations in the future. 
Office Repositioning Strategy.    Our office repositioning strategy is to own and acquire, at a discount to replacement cost, high-quality multi-tenant assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. Our efforts in the office sector will primarily be focused on larger buildings in central business districts and major urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply.
Financing Policies.    Our debt indenture and its supplements contain financial covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our Board of Trustees may determine to seek additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, retention of cash flows in excess of distributions to shareholders or a combination of these methods. One of our properties is encumbered by a mortgage. To the extent that our Board of Trustees decides to obtain additional debt financing, we may do so on an unsecured basis or a secured basis, subject to limitations in existing financing or other contractual arrangements; we may seek to obtain lines of credit or to issue securities senior to our common and/or preferred shares, including preferred shares or debt securities which may be convertible into common shares or be accompanied by warrants to purchase common shares; or we may engage in transactions which involve a sale or other conveyance of properties to affiliated or unaffiliated entities. We may finance acquisitions by an exchange of properties, by assuming outstanding mortgage debt on the acquired properties, by the issuance of additional equity securities or debt or by using retained cash flow from operations and dispositions. The proceeds from any of our financings may be used to pay distributions, to provide working capital, to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions and expansions of existing or new properties. We may from time to time re-evaluate and modify our financing policies in light of then current market conditions, relative availability and costs of debt and equity capital, the changing values of properties, growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors, and we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to total capitalization.
Competition.    Investing in and operating real estate is a highly competitive business. We compete against other REITs, numerous financial institutions, individuals and public and private companies who are actively engaged in this business. Also, we compete for tenants and investments based on a number of factors including pricing, underwriting criteria and reputation. Our ability to successfully compete is also impacted by economic and population trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial leasing and investment terms, availability and cost of capital and new and existing laws and regulations. Some of our competitors are dominant in selected geographic markets, including in markets in which we operate. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have. 
For additional information on competition and the risks associated with our business, please see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental and Climate Change Matters.    Under various federal, state and local laws related to environmental, health and safety matters, owners, former owners, operators and tenants of real estate may be subject to liabilities resulting from the presence of hazardous substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, under, or emanating from such real estate, including costs for investigating and remediating or removing hazardous substances present at or migrating from such properties, liabilities for property damage or personal injuries, natural resource damages, and costs and losses arising from property use restrictions or diminution in value. We, or our tenants, also may incur liability for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. We do not believe that there are environmental conditions or issues at any of our properties that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, no assurances can be given that conditions or issues are not present at our properties or that costs we may be required to incur in the future to remediate contamination or comply with environmental, health and safety laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
We estimate the cost to remove hazardous substances or address environmental issues at some of our properties based in part on environmental surveys and analyses conducted on our properties.

Some of our properties have been or may be impacted by releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products. Such contamination may arise from a variety of sources, including historic uses of our properties for commercial or industrial purposes, spills of such materials at adjacent properties, or releases from tanks used on our properties to store petroleum or hazardous substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on sites upon which or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others, including former owners or tenants, have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Though we have reviewed these properties for potential environmental liabilities, we cannot assure that we have identified all potential environmental liabilities.
Certain of our buildings contain asbestos. We believe any asbestos in our buildings is contained in accordance with current regulations. If we remove the asbestos or renovate or demolish these properties, certain environmental regulations govern the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and removed, which could result in increased costs.
For more information regarding environmental matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We could incur significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations which are intended to impact carbon emissions. We believe these laws may cause energy costs at our properties to increase, but we do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants directly or in large part may be passed through by us to our tenants as additional lease payments. Laws enacted to mitigate climate change may cause us to make material investments in our properties which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. We evaluate ways to improve the energy efficiency at all of our properties. For more information regarding climate change matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may be adversely affected by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
