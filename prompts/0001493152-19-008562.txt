Item 1. Business.
Organization
 
Indoor Harvest Corp (the “Company”) is a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Our principal executive office is located at 7401 W. Slaughter Lane #5078, Austin, Texas 78739. From inception until August 4, 2017, the Company provided full service, state of the art design-build, engineering, procurement and construction services to the indoor and vertical farming industry. The Company provided production platforms, mechanical systems and complete custom designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) and Building Integrated Agriculture (“BIA”), for two unique industries, produce and cannabis.
 
In mid-2016, the Company began efforts to separate its produce and cannabis related operations due to ongoing feedback from both clients and potential institutional investors. It was determined that the Company’s involvement in the cannabis industry was creating conflicts for clients and potential institutional investors wishing to work with the Company from the produce industry due to the public perception and political issues surrounding the cannabis industry. By late-2016, the Company had decided to cease actively selling its products and services to the vertical farming industry and to focus on utilizing the Company’s developed technology and methods for the cannabis industry.
 
On August 3, 2017, we formed Alamo Acquisition, LLC, a wholly owned Texas limited liability company (“Alamo Acquisition Sub”). On August 4, 2017, the Company ceased actively supporting business development of vertical farms for produce production and consummated a business acquisition (the “Alamo Acquisition”) pursuant to which Alamo Acquisition Sub acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Alamo CBD, LLC (“Alamo CBD”), a Texas limited liability company. Upon closing of the Alamo Acquisition, the membership interests of Alamo CBD were exchanged for 7,584,008 shares of Indoor Harvest’s common stock, the parent company of Alamo Acquisition Sub. Alamo CBD continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist.
 
On November 12, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) amended the Company’s Bylaws, effective on that date.
 
Description of Business
 
Indoor Harvest, through its brand name Indoor Harvest®, is focused on leveraging technology and planning on Vertical Farming, Building Integrated Agriculture, Controlled Environment Agriculture and Aeroponic Cultivation technology with other synergistic enterprises in the Cannabis industry as part of our new 2019 merger and acquistion or an M&A/vertical integration strategy.
 
We have developed technology relating to a high pressure aeroponic platform for growing cannabis. Aeroponic production differs from both conventional hydroponics and in-vitro (plant tissue culture) growing. Unlike hydroponics, which uses water as a growing medium, along with essential minerals to sustain plant growth, aeroponics uses no growing medium. We plan to continue to look for partners and opportunities to refine the development and commercialization of our high pressure Aeroponic Cultivation technology.
 
At the same time, we are aggressively positioning the Company as an integrated consolidation platform offering other cannabis companies the opportunity to be part of a bigger play, sharing intellectual capital, technology, access to new capital markets and liquidity for investors.
 
Our focus will be on aggregating and integrating early stage cannabis companies focused on Genetics, Tissue Culture, Controlled Environment Ag technologies, including high pressure Aeroponic Cultivation, Micropropagation and Cultivation operations. While we don’t have arrangements with such institutions, we are seeking university level science relationships among other relationships.

Our operational expenditures are being refocused to primarily relate d to further our plans to create shareholder value through an M&A and strategic partnership strategy, while developing our technology, launching and completing joint test trials, developing research partnerships and collaboration, and of course the costs related to being a fully reporting company with the SEC.
 
Industry and Regulatory Overview
 
The United States federal government regulates drugs through the CSA (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as highly addictive and having no medical value. The United States Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) has not approved the sale of cannabis for any medical application. Doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical use under federal law, however, they can recommend its use under the First Amendment. In 2010, the United States Veterans Affairs Department clarified that veterans using medicinal cannabis will not be denied services or other medications that are denied to those using illegal drugs.
 
State legalization efforts conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) providing that where states and local governments enact laws authorizing cannabis-related use, and implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems, the federal government will rely upon states and local enforcement agencies to address cannabis activity through the enforcement of their own state and local narcotics laws.
 
On January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended the Cole Memo and replaced it with a new Memorandum titled with the subject “Marijuana Enforcement” from Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo.
 
In November 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned and left the DOJ. As a nominee, Attorney General William Barr testified before the U.S. Senate and wrote to Congress that, as Attorney General, he would not seek to prosecute cannabis companies that relied on the Cole Memo and are complying with state law.
 
As of April 25, 2019, 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam allow their citizens to use medical cannabis through de-criminalization. Within this list of jurisdictions, voters in the States of Alaska, California, Colorado, D.C., Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use.
 
The Company continues to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress’ positions on federal law and cannabis policy. As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell in the U.S. and directly violating federal law if we should begin producing cannabis under State law. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis.
 
As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited to, a claim of aiding and abetting another’s criminal activities or directly violating the CSA. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who “commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal” (18 U.S.C. §2(a).) Enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in the Company being unable to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture which could lead to an entire loss of any investment in the Company. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.

Changes in Business Operations
 
Changes in Business Operations
 
2019 is a continuation of our 2018 restructuring, reorganizing and repositioning for us. Thankfully, with the help of our financing and other relationships or partners, we are now positioning to reemerge with new management, momentum and ideas to further our technology whilst leveraging our public company to create shareholder value.
 
At the same time, the Company has expanded its vision and mission to enhance and accelerate the creation of new value for shareholders by pursuing a new two-pronged strategy.
 
The first prong is to continue to look for opportunities to build and deploy our technology designs in partnership with others.
 
The second prong of the strategy will be to seek out strategic partnerships and M&A opportunities with other synergistic enterprises that can benefit by leveraging our public vehicle and management expertise. We plan to expand our team and capabilities to fill this role.
 
On March 15, 2018, the Company formed its’ scientific advisory board, which will assist management in the development of its business plans in the cannabis industry. The initial members of the scientific advisory board will consist of Dr. Ronald Walter, Dr. Nadia Sabeh and Mr. Damian Solomon.
 
Alamo CBD, LLC Asset Acquisition
 
On January 3, 2017, the Company signed a binding LOI with Alamo CBD to enter discussions to combine and create a medical cannabinoids pharmaceutical group. On August 3, 2017, we formed Alamo Acquisition Sub, a wholly owned Texas limited liability company.
 
On August 4, 2017, the Company consummated a business acquisition (the “Alamo Acquisition”) pursuant to which Alamo Acquisition Sub acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of Alamo CBD, LLC (“Alamo CBD”), a Texas limited liability company. Upon closing of the Alamo Acquisition, the members of Alamo CBD (the “Alamo Surviving Members”) exchanged their membership interests in Alamo CBD for 7,584,008 shares of Indoor Harvest’s common stock. Alamo CBD continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary and Alamo Acquisition Sub ceased to exist.
 
In addition to the foregoing, following the closing of the Alamo Acquisition, and Alamo CBD being successfully awarded a provisional or full license to produce and dispense cannabis in the State of Texas, Indoor Harvest will issue to the individual Alamo Surviving Members, an additional Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,500,000) of newly-issued shares of common stock of Indoor Harvest, par value $0.001, based upon the three (3) day average closing price of the Company’s common stock, as quoted on the OTCQB, prior to the time of issuance. However, there can be no assurance that Alamo CBD will be awarded such license in the near future or at all.
 
Additionally, upon Alamo CBD successfully being registered and licensed by the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) to produce and dispense cannabis under federal law, Indoor Harvest will issue to the individual Alamo Surviving Members, an additional Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) cash payment, or newly-issued shares of common stock of Indoor Harvest, par value $0.001, based upon the three (3) day average closing price of the Company’s common stock, as quoted on the OTCQB, prior to the time of issuance, at the option of the individual Alamo Surviving Members. A combination of cash and common stock may be elected by Alamo Surviving Members individually. However, there can be no assurance that Alamo CBD will be registered or licensed by the DEA, in the near future or at all.
 
On August 8, 2017, Chad Sykes, the Company’s Founder and Chief of Cultivation, returned 2,500,000 shares of common stock to the Company. Mr. Sykes voluntarily returned such shares in order to prevent dilution to the Company’s shareholders as a result of the Alamo Acquisition and in order to facilitate the Alamo Acquisition. The return of common stock by Chad Sykes was a non-cash transaction and reduced the common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The cancellation of shares was not applied to the acquisition of assets from Alamo CBD. Therefore, there was a $1,440,961 impairment loss of intangible assets

On September 6, 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 7,584,008 shares of common stock to the members of Alamo CBD related to the Alamo Acquisition.
 
Contractual Joint Venture with Alamo CBD and Vyripharm Enterprises, LLC
 
On March 23, 2017, Indoor Harvest entered into a Contractual Joint Venture Agreement (the “Vyripharm Joint Venture Agreement”) by and between Vyripharm Enterprises, LLC (“Vyripharm”) and Alamo CBD, pursuant to which the parties agreed to participate in an unincorporated joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) for the following business purposes:
 

● | The parties would work together to enhance the ability of Alamo CBD to apply for and obtain licensure, or a permit, to grow and/or dispense marijuana products for medical and/or consumer use, as the case may be: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | In Texas, pursuant to the Texas Compassionate Use Act, as may be amended; 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | In Colorado, pursuant to recent Colorado legislation permitting foreign ownership of entities that grow and/or dispense marijuana products for medical and/or consumer use; and 
iii. | Pursuant to recent United States Drug Enforcement Administration regulations which expand the opportunities for entities providing research involving marijuana and its chemical constituents, as referenced in 21 U.S.C. 822(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. 823(a), et. seq. 


● | To establish Alamo CBD as a supplier of a variety of medical use cannabis oil to Vyripharm for Vyripharm’s use in conducting research and development to create novel pharmaceutical and radiopharmaceutical compounds designed to image and treat certain debilitating diseases including, but not limited to epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s, ALS, and other neurodegenerative diseases; and to establish Indoor Harvest as the project developer and engineering, procurement and construction group, in which Indoor Harvest is responsible for costs and efforts related to Alamo CBD’s efforts to become licensed under the Texas Compassionate Use Act and to meet its obligations under this Joint Venture agreement. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company paid an initial down payment of $250,000 under the Joint Venture Agreement on March 30, 2017.
 
As published in the Texas Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) Self-Evaluation Report, on page 543, question (D), dated September 29, 2017, the DPS originally interpreted the statute as requiring a market-based system by which the number and location of licensees are determined by market factors rather than by regulation – as not mandating or limiting the number of licensed distributors. It was originally understood that the applicants would be required to satisfy certain basic requirements prior to licensure, and the ability to maintain compliance with DPS guidelines will be evaluated through on-going audits and inspections.
 
In late 2016, the DPS modified its approach to restrict the number of licenses to three. This necessitated the development of a competitive review process, where three applicants were conditionally approved based on the review of the submitted application materials. Upon successful onsite inspection of their facilities, qualified applicants will be issued licenses. Because of this competitive review process, the Joint Venture group placed 16th out of 43 applicants and its application is currently considered pending by the DPS.
 
On June 30, 2017, the Company, Alamo CBD and Vyripharm entered into discussions to amend and extend the payment terms under the Joint Venture Agreement due to the group not being awarded one of the three initial provisional licenses to produce cannabis in Texas under the TCUP.

On August 7, 2017, after negotiations, the Company advised Vyripharm that it intended to voluntarily default on the Joint Venture Agreement and the Company wrote off the $250,000 down payment towards the Joint Venture investment and there is no further obligation by either party under the terms of the Joint Venture. The Company’s management determined that without a license to produce cannabis, the Company would not be able to fully utilize the intent of the Joint Venture partnership and the Company would be financially burdened by the ongoing Joint Venture terms. Both parties agreed that this decision would not impair either party’s ability to pursue a Joint Venture in the future, after the Company, or Alamo CBD, obtained license to produce cannabis. Should the Company voluntarily default on the Joint Venture, the agreement would terminate and neither party would have further obligation to the other.
 
Other Agreements
 
On October 11, 2017, we entered into a binding letter of intent (the “Zoned Properties LOI”) with Zoned Properties Inc (“Zoned Properties”), outlining three pending independent agreements to complete research and development projects for licensed medical cannabis facilities to be located in Tempe, Arizona, Parachute, Colorado and Stockdale, Texas or other location to be determined after approval of a provisional license under the TCUP. If the three independent agreements were not agreed upon prior to January 9, 2018, the Zoned Properties LOI would have automatically terminated. The parties extended the term of the LOI in January 2018.
 
The extension expired in April 2018 resulting in the Zoned Properties LOI being terminated and the parties having no further obligation to one another. We made total non-refundable payments of $50,000 to Zoned Properties.
 
Research and Development
 
MIT CityFarm (MIT OPenAg)
 
On September 18, 2013, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the “MIT Letter Agreement”) for the Transfer of Materials with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”). Pursuant to the MIT Letter Agreement, the Company was to provide MIT with an aeroponic system components and fixtures manufactured by Indoor Harvest for the purpose of developing a wall facade aeroponic and hydroponic system, also known as the “Food Server”, as part of MIT’s Media Lab “Changing Places” project (“MIT CityFarm”). Indoor Harvest was responsible for providing technical assistance and materials as a “Technical Systems Adviser”. Per the Company’s role as a Technical Systems Adviser, the Company was exposed to research that showed the potential for using aeroponics, LED lighting, controlled environments and sensor technologies in the development of environmental and climate recipes to achieve a specific phenotypic response of cultivars.
 
On March 14, 2017, the Company ceased all support for the MIT CityFarm project, due to decisions by MIT CityFarm principals, in which the terms of the MIT Letter Agreement were not honored due to concerns over the Company’s involvement with cannabis. The MIT Letter Agreement required the acknowledgement by MIT CityFarm of the use of any source materials, such as the Company’s aeroponic designs, in any publications reporting its use.
 
Below are pictures of the Company’s installation of aeroponic and hydroponic systems at MITCityFarm:

Canopy Growth Cannabis Pilot
 
Based on knowledge gained while working with MIT CityFarm, the Company saw a business opportunity to use the Company’s technology and methods within the cannabis industry. On December 18, 2014, the Company entered into a Cannabis Production Pilot Agreement (the “Canopy Cannabis Pilot”) with Canopy Growth Corporation (formerly Tweed Marijuana Inc.), a Canadian company (“Canopy Growth”). Canopy Growth is a Toronto Stock Exchange listed company. Its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tweed Inc., Tweed Farms Inc. (formerly Prime1 Construction Services Corp.), Bedrocan Canada and Spectrum Cannabis, are licensed producers of medical cannabis in Canada. The principal activities of Canopy Growth are the production and sale of cannabis through its wholly owned subsidiaries as regulated by the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations. The Canopy Cannabis Pilot was broken into two separate phases, as follows:

● | During Phase One, tests were conducted using prototypes provided by Indoor Harvest. The purpose of Phase One was to test the initial design and evaluate the root mass development of various strains of cannabis chosen by Canopy Growth. Two trials were conducted during Phase One. Phase One recorded the growth rate, phytocannabinoid production, water usage, fertilizer usage and labor using the aeroponics systems provided by Indoor Harvest. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | During Phase Two, Canopy Growth was given the option to request Design Build services to be provided by Indoor Harvest. Indoor Harvest provided these services free of charge and provided projected costs associated with the manufacture and installation of new aeroponic designs (“New IP”). Canopy Growth was then provided the option to purchase equipment from Indoor Harvest based on these projected costs. 

Phase One Cannabis Pilot
 
Trial 1: Strain Ghost Train Haze
 
In March 2015, we began the first trial under the Canopy Cannabis Pilot. A Cannabis Sativa dominant strain, Ghost Train Haze, was selected and 8 plants were grown in a 64-cubic foot root chamber HPA Table prototype using a “Screen of Green” cultivation method, in which plants are cropped and trained to produce a higher yield from a single plant. The initial Canopy Cannabis Pilot utilized 1040 watts of illumitex® brand LED lighting using the F3 Spectrum and 2,000 watts of Mogul based HPS lighting. The system was operated drain to waste, in which no water was recirculated or recaptured. The following results were recorded under the initial Cannabis Pilot.

● | An increase of up to 91% in average dry yield under HPS lighting when compared to the existing average. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | An increase of up to 71% in average dry yield under LED lighting when compared to the existing average. 
● | An increase of up to 117% in liters of water per day/plant under HPS lighting. 
● | An increase of up to 183% in liters of water per day/plant under LED lighting. 
● | A decrease of up to 21% in nutrient use under HPS lighting and no change under LED lighting.

Trial 2: Strain UK Cheese
 
In December 2015, we began a second trial under our Canopy Cannabis Pilot with Canopy Growth and similar results were achieved confirming the initial trial results. The second trial utilized an increased plant count of 20 plants per HPA Table prototype and the strain selected was UK Cheese, a Cannabis Sativa and Cannabis Indica hybrid. The second trial also tested root mass differences between a prototype 64 cubic foot and a 32-cubic foot root chamber. The second trial utilized 1040 watts of illumitex® brand LED lighting using the X5 Spectrum and 2,000 watts of Double Ended based HPS lighting and used a “Screen of Green” cultivation method. The following results from the second trial were recorded:

● | An increase of up to 86% in average dry yield under HPS lighting when compare to the existing average. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | An increase of up to 25% in average dry yield under LED lighting when compared to the existing average. 
● | An increase of up to 89% in liters of water per day/plant under HPS lighting. 
● | An increase of up to 70% in liters of water per day/plant under LED lighting. 
● | A decrease of up to 69% in nutrient use under HPS lighting and 72% decrease under LED lighting. 

Trial 1 and 2 Summary
 
Indoor Harvest provided minimal instructional input during both trials. The Company believes the results of the Cannabis Pilot show the potential for the Company’s technology and that without any significant instructional support, operators can achieve significant gains in yield and reductions in costs. There was a noticeable difference recorded in the morphology of the Cannabis strains tested utilizing the Company’s aeroponic platforms over the baseline using drip irrigation and a coco medium. During the first trial, the strain tested showed a significant increase in the size of the plants fan leaves over the baseline methods leading to a potential increase of up to 150% in produced biomass.
 
The aeroponic systems provided showed a significant increase in growth rate during the vegetative stage, as compared to baseline methods. Additionally, there were noticeable differences in the development of roots under certain conditions and difference we’re recorded in phenotypic response. The results of both trials showed an ability to provide greater control over the root environment, provided an ability to monitor nutrient uptake, provided an increase in yield, showed a dramatic decrease in nutrient use and provided an ability to prevent contamination by eliminating mediums. The Company believes that with further development of additional automation, integration of LED, HVAC and controls that we can continue to improve on the performance of the Company’s technology and methods. All trials were conducted using primarily a drain to waste configuration in which system runoff was not recaptured or recycled.
 
Phase Two Cannabis Pilot
 
On July 6, 2016, we entered into Phase Two of our Canopy Cannabis Pilot with Canopy Growth Corporation and signed a design-build, DBEPC, cost plus contract with Tweed, a subsidiary of Canopy Growth, to construct a high Pressure Aeroponic production system.
 
On May 31, 2017, the Company notified Canopy Growth that it had completed the majority of work under Phase Two of its Cannabis Pilot. The Company installed 13 HPA Table systems and 1 custom built Nutrient Pump Skid at Canopy Growth for an internal economic pilot. The Company submitted proposals to Canopy Growth for three designs for potential New IP development under the Canopy Cannabis Pilot. Canopy Growth did not pursue these proposals and chose to integrate the Company’s HPA Table fixtures and a custom-built Nutrient Pump Skid into previously existing facility fertigation and mechanical systems at Canopy Growth. This integration further proved the Company’s fixture-based design allowing for custom installations based on an operator’s specifications. Canopy Growth has ongoing rights to purchase additional equipment from Indoor Harvest through a fixed cost plus agreement but is under no obligation to do so. The Phase Two Cannabis Pilot expired December 18, 2017.
 
Our Current Portfolio of Product Designs
 
The Company has developed and maintains proprietary high pressure aeroponic cultivation system designs as well as flood and drain and floating raft designs, for cannabis and other agriculture products. Below is a brief description of the Company’s products.
The Indoor Harvest® Modular HP-Aeroponics Platform
 
The system comprises of seven primary fixture components that consist of an Aeroponic Growth Tray (“AGT”), Aeroponic Growth Lid (“AGL”), Aeroponic Spray Manifold (“ASM”), Aeroponic Pressure Manifold (“APM”), Nutrient Delivery System (“NDS”), Water Reclamation and Recirculation System, and Lift Station. The combination of an AGT, AGL and ASM is known as an “HPA Table”. The combination of an APM and NDS is known as a “Nutrient Pump Skid”. Each of these individual modular fixtures are combined to create custom configurations suitable for any form of indoor growing environment.

Initially designed to produce leafy greens, micro-greens, fruiting plants and herbs, our fixtures can be easily adapted for a variety of other uses, such as horticultural research, medicinal plant production, plant cloning and hardwood propagation. A smaller version of our basic design was utilized at MITCityFarm and our larger system has been independently tested by Canopy Growth Corporation. The results of these and the Company’s own internal trials has shown the following benefits over a more traditional hydroponic system:



 | ● Up to a 95% reduction in water usage 
---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------
● Up to a 70% reduction in fertilizers
● Accelerated growth rate 
● Increased plant biomass 
● Increased phytochemical content 
● Elimination of growing mediums

Intellectual Property
 
The Company relies on a strategy of a combination of patent law, trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. This does not mean these efforts are up to date or fully effective. The following summarizes certain filings. The Company is currently studying the legal aspects of these, including recent and past communications from counsel and the patent office, and makes no promise or representation as to this information which is subject to correction and update.
 
The Company’s primary trademark is “Indoor Harvest.” This trademark was registered (Registration Number 4,795,471) in the United States on August 18, 2015.
 
The Company filed a patent application (Serial Number 14/120,275) with the United States patent office related to an invention titled: “modular aeroponic system and related methods.” The inventor is Chad Sykes, who assigned the patent application to the Company.
 
We will research the status of our filings and restructure or update as needed this year.
 
Plan of Expanded Operations
 
Our plan of expanded operations for the next 12 months, assuming we secure the necessary funding, is stated herein. In summary, we plan to grow the Company through acquisitions, joint ventures and other relationships.
Sales and Marketing
 
We seek to differentiate ourselves in a crowded market. While we continue to look for opportunities to leverage our aeroponic system designs to further refine development and commercialization, we are now also positioning the Company as an integrated consolidation platform offering cannabis companies the opportunity to be part of a bigger play, sharing intellectual capital, technology, access to capital markets and liquidity for investors.
 
We will be working on branding and building our team in 2019, once we have our new plans funded.
 
Competition and Market Position
 
We are taking a two-pronged approach to creating shareholder value for Indoor Harvest.
 
We will continue to look for opportunities to deploy some aspect of our aeroponic cultivation technology in an R&D setting to complete development and commercialization. Additionally, we have an opportunity to leverage our public company as a consolidation vehicle with other synergistic and like-minded companies in the Cannabis industry. This may be done by asset acquisitions, mergers, ventures or other methods.

OTC Markets
 
OTC Markets offer small companies almost all the benefits of the NYSE or Nasdaq markets, a liquid, secondary trading market, visibility, access to capital, a public market valuation and the ability for small companies to build their brand and reputation across the network, at nearly half the cost of an NYSE listing.
 
We are positioning to compete with consolidated or vertically integrated cannabis science and technology companies trading on the OTC Markets.
 
Technology Competition
 
We will be a small competitor in the industry. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. We believe based upon management’s knowledge of the industry that we are the first company to develop and offer a fixture based, fully integrated aeroponic biomanufacturing platform for the cannabis industry. Instead of relying on a product-based design, we have developed individual fixtures that can be used in whole, or in part, to create a variety of modular designs of any scale, or size. By breaking our platform down into individual, independent fixtures, we offer a level of customizability that currently is not offered by our competitors.
Manufacturing
 
The Company does not foresee manufacturing its own product platform to sell to the cannabis market.
 
Rather, we will pursue opportunities to develop our technology with third party partners and eventually license or sell that technology or deploy it in the market as part of a joint venture cultivation operation.
 
The Company plans to source products and accessories from third party manufacturing companies that manufacture products in part using tooling we own, in accordance with our specifications.
 
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2019, we have 2 part-time employees and a variety of advisors and consultants.
 
Governmental Regulation and Certification
 
Except as set forth below, we are not aware of any material governmental regulations or approvals for any of our products or services.
 
As the possession and use of cannabis is illegal under the CSA, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the equipment we intend to sell, lease and license in the U.S. to grow cannabis. Additionally, we would be violating federal law should we begin to manufacture and dispense cannabis under the TCUP. Under federal law, and more specifically the CSA, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis is illegal. Our equipment could be used by persons or entities engaged in the business of possession, use, cultivation, and/or transfer of cannabis. As a result, law enforcement authorities, in their attempt to regulate the illegal use of cannabis, could seek to bring an action or actions against us, including, but not limited, to a claim of aiding and abetting another’s criminal activities or directly violating federal law by manufacturing or distributing cannabis. The federal aiding and abetting statute provides that anyone who “commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.” However, we do not believe that our plans to license and sell technology as described herein violates federal law and we believe that we would prevail if any such action were brought against us although there can be no assurance of this.
 
Cannabis is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in such states that have legalized the use of cannabis, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan, notably with respect to our plans for cannabis cultivation, production and research. In addition, our assets, including real property, cash, equipment and other goods, could be subject to asset forfeiture because cannabis is still illegal at the federal level should we begin to manufacture and distribute cannabis under the TCUP.

In February 2017, the Trump administration made announcements that there could be “greater enforcement” of federal laws regarding cannabis. To this end, on January 4, 2018, the DOJ suspended certain Obama era protections set forth previously in the Cole Memo, as such term is defined above, which was replaced with a new Memorandum titled with the subject “Marijuana Enforcement” from Attorney General Jeff Sessions which provides that each U.S. Attorney has the discretion to determine which types of cannabis-related cases should be federally prosecuted, thus ending the broad safe harbor provided under the Cole Memo. Any such enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In November 2018, Attorney General Sessions resigned and left the DOJ. As a nominee, Attorney General William Barr testified before the U.S. Senate and wrote to Congress that, as Attorney General, he would not seek to prosecute cannabis companies that relied on the Cole Memo and are complying with state law. The Company plans to continue to follow and monitor the actions and statements of the Trump administration, the DOJ and Congress’ positions on federal law and cannabis policy.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
 
Additional Information
 
We are a public company and file annual, quarterly and special reports and other information with the SEC. We are not required to, and do not intend to, deliver an annual report to security holders. Our filings are available, at no charge, to the public at http://www.sec.gov.
