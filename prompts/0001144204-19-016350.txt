Corporate Information
 
We were organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Florida on March 12, 2014 under the name “PGP Holdings V, Inc.” On May 5, 2014, we changed our name to Eyenovia, Inc. On October 6, 2014, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware by merging into Eyenovia, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive office is located at 295 Madison Avenue, Suite 2400, New York, NY 10017, and our phone number is 917-289-1117. Our website is http://www.eyenoviabio.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this report, and you should not consider information on our website to be part of this report.
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage ophthalmic biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of microdose therapeutics utilizing our patented piezo-print delivery technology, branded the OptejetTM. Eyenovia aims to achieve clinical microdosing of next-generation formulations of well-established ophthalmic pharmaceutical agents using its high-precision targeted ocular delivery system, which has the potential to replace conventional eye dropper delivery and improve safety, tolerability, patient compliance and topical delivery success for ophthalmic eye treatments. In the clinic, Optejet has demonstrated up to a 75% reduction in ocular drug and preservative exposure, with successful topical delivery that is consistent with the efficacy of traditional eye drop administration. Using its proprietary delivery technology, Eyenovia is developing the next generation of smart ophthalmic therapies while targeting new indications for which there are currently no drug therapies approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. Eyenovia’s microdose therapeutics follow the FDA-designated pharmaceutical registrational and regulatory process. Its products are not classified by the FDA as medical devices or drug-device combination products.
 
Eyenovia has completed its Phase III trials for MicroStat and announced positive results from the MicroStat MIST-1 and MIST-2 studies. MicroStat is a fixed combination formulation of phenylephrine-tropicamide for mydriasis (pupil dilation), designed to be a novel approach for the estimated 80 million office-based comprehensive and diabetic eye exams and four million ophthalmic surgical dilations performed every year in the United States. Additionally, in February 2019, the FDA accepted Eyenovia’s investigational new drug application, or IND, to initiate our Phase III registration trial of MicroPine to reduce the progression of myopia in children. MicroPine is a first-in-class topical therapy for the treatment of progressive myopia, a back-of-the-eye ocular disease associated with pathologic axial elongation and sclero-retinal stretching affecting approximately five million people. We also have received clear feedback from the FDA regarding the requirements for Phase III trials for our MicroProst program. MicroProst is a novel latanoprost formulation for lowering intraocular pressure, or IOP, in patients with ocular hypertension, or OHT, primary open angle glaucoma, or PAOG, and chronic angle closure glaucoma, or CACG. MicroTears, our over-the-counter, or OTC, product candidate for hyperemia (red eye), pruritis (itch) and dry eye, will not require Phase III trials, and we plan to proceed with registration activities for MicroTears in 2019.
 
Results from our three Phase II clinical trials have been published in peer-reviewed literature. Two studies evaluating our mydriatic agents demonstrated how the Optejet consistently delivered precision dosing at the volume of the eye’s natural tear film capacity of 6-8 µL, which reduced ocular and systemic drug and preservative exposure, while demonstrating pupil dilation comparable to conventional eye drops with fewer side effects. In the third study, we evaluated usability, patient tolerability and IOP lowering of microdosed latanoprost administered with the Optejet. In this study, eyes receiving microdosed latanoprost achieved IOP reduction consistent with published literature on latanoprost eye drops, and administration of the medication was successful in a single attempt in more than 90% of cases. Based on the results from these clinical trials, we were able to advance MicroStat into Phase III utilizing the 505(b)(2) pathway and plan to do the same with MicroPine and MicroProst. Where possible, we also intend to use this pathway for future clinical trials in new indications with significant unmet needs.

A key feature of the Optejet is the embedded electronic, smartphone enabled “e-health” system, which we believe is the first intelligent electronic delivery system for ophthalmic therapies. Our electronic functions are designed to enable patients and physicians to track when doses are administered to better monitor and improve patient compliance.
 
The following summarizes our product pipeline and next expected milestones:
 

Product Candidate | Indication | Next Expected Milestones 
-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------
MicroStat | Mydriasis (Eye Dilation) | NDA Filing (2020) 
MicroPine | Pediatric Myopia Progression (Near-Sightedness) | Phase III Start (2019) 
MicroProst | IOP Lowering in CACG, OACG, OHT | Phase III Start (2019) 
MicroTears | Hyperemia (Red Eye), Pruritis (Itch), Dry Eye | OTC Monograph Registration (2019)

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading ophthalmic biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a strong pipeline of first-in-class microdose therapeutics and a digital health platform for interactive patient care. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:
 
Establish a portfolio of first-in-class piezo-print micro-therapeutic products for multiple eye treatments through the 505(b)(2) pathway with the FDA. We are initially focused on integrating our next-generation technology with therapeutic compounds already well established in the topical treatment of ophthalmic indications. We believe that the 505(b)(2) registration pathway, which reduces development risk compared to new molecular entity programs by working with known compounds with well-established safety and efficacy profiles, will be available for our initial development pipeline. We believe our pipeline of patented micro-therapeutic product candidates will be highly differentiated by our improved tolerability and enhanced compliance profile and our late-stage development programs could lead to New Drug Application, or NDA, submissions in novel indications where the products can have unique dosing and therapeutic profiles. We believe that this could lead to favorable pricing and reimbursement, and a reduced risk of generic substitution.
 
Improve clinical outcomes and patient experiences while providing an improved tolerability profile with our micro-therapeutics. We believe the Optejet will allow for high precision targeted microdosing for multiple eye treatments, while eliminating ophthalmic over-dosing and reducing ocular exposure to toxic preservatives and pharmacologic ingredients compared to conventional eye drop delivery mechanisms. Our clinical trials have demonstrated similar efficacy to eye drops, improved side effect profile and enhanced patient experience with the Optejet as compared to conventional eye drops.
 
Leverage our electronic, smartphone-enabled “e-health” technology to introduce and develop patient-specific compliance monitoring program. The mobile e-health technology within the Optejet is designed to track when a patient administers treatments, allowing physicians to monitor patient compliance accurately. We believe this may enhance patient compliance and improve compliance monitoring by empowering patients and physicians with access to dynamic, real-time monitoring and compliance data for a more intelligent, informed and personalized therapeutic paradigm.
 
Develop microdose treatments for other ophthalmic diseases independently or in collaboration with third parties. The Optejet may also be suitable for new molecular entities and applications. Leveraging our existing platform technology, Eyenovia plans to continue developing, either independently or through strategic relationships with third parties, other product candidates for various eye diseases that can be administered using the Optejet and additional applications for the Optejet. We have entered into an exclusive agreement with Senju Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., a leading ophthalmology company in Japan, for the Asian development and commercial rights of our therapies and technology.
 
Develop solutions for ophthalmic conditions with high unmet needs and no approved therapy. We plan to target chronic ophthalmic conditions with a high unmet medical need. By leveraging our piezo-print microdosing technology, we aim to reach conditions where there are no approved drug therapies. For example, our MicroPine program involves a proprietary formulation of low-dose atropine intended to slow myopia progression in the pediatric population. There are currently no commercially-available therapies in the United States to treat this indication.

Limitations of Conventional Eye Therapies 
 
Our microdosing platform technology aims to address the following issues associated with conventional eye drop-based therapies:
 
 Dosing, administration and waste of medication 
 
Multiple third-party studies have confirmed the challenges with administering conventional eye drops including overdosing, poor compliance, imprecise dosing, variability in drop size, and patient difficulty in self-administering. One study in patients who were experienced in using eye drops and undergoing treatment for glaucoma for at leastsix months documented that nine out of 10 patients were unable to deliver topical treatment correctly at the end of the six-month treatment. Patients on average administered almost twice the macrodose with a range of one to eight drops (1.8+/-1.2), and 75% of patients risked bottle contamination or potential ocular trauma by having the eye dropper container touch their eyes. Another larger study in 139 patients demonstrated that the proportion of patients who were able to correctly deliver therapy on the eye was only 22%–30%. Similarly, other studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of patients either overdose or do not administer correctly the required therapy to the eye, which leads to unnecessary waste of medication.
 
  Side effects associated with conventional macrodose therapies 
 
Conventional eye therapies are administered using traditional eye-dropper pipette approaches. Current eye drop therapies can overdose the eye with 30–50 µL of preservatives and pharmaceutical ingredients while the eye only holds 6–8 µL. Thus, traditional drops can severely overdose the eye, which can be associated with ocular side effects including hyperemia, or increased blood flow to the eye, redness, discomfort, stinging, blurred vision, burning, itching, excessive tearing, eye pain, iris pigment changes, foreign body sensation, pigment discoloration, periorbital dermatitis and sunken eye. For some topical medications, there are also cardiovascular side effects such as bradycardia and arrhythmia that are caused when medications are absorbed into the circulation system from overdosing —both through conjunctiva absorption and when drugs flow into the nose through the naso-lacrimal duct and are absorbed in the nose or swallowed. For example, phenylephrine can cause cardiovascular adverse reactions including an increase in blood pressure, syncope, myocardial infarction, tachycardia, arrhythmia and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported following systemic or ophthalmic administration of timolol maleate.
 
Prostaglandins are a widely-used class of drugs for glaucoma. However, as shown in the chart below, they present a high risk of ocular irritation and adverse events. We believe microdosing will result in fewer adverse events due to less exposure to the drug and preservatives.
 

Frequencies of Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
---------------------------------------------------------
 | Latanoprost (n = 136) | | Bimatoprost (n = 137) | | Travoprost (n = 138) | 
 | n | | % | | No. of Events | n | % | | No. of Events | | n | % | No. of Events | | P Value | 
Patients with at least one adverse event | | 87 | | 64 | | 137 | | 104 | | 75.9 | | 200 | | 95 | | 68.8 | 159 | 0.098
Patients with ocular adverse events | | 73 | | 53.7 | | 110 | | 101 | | 73.7 | | 162 | | 89 | | 64.5 | 129 | 0.003
Patients with systemic adverse events | | 23 | | 16.9 | | 27 | | 25 | | 18.2 | | 38 | | 23 | | 16.7 | 30 | 0.933
Patients with adverse events related to study medications | | 70 | | 51.5 | | 90 | | 94 | | 68.6 | | 140 | | 81 | | 58.7 | 108 | 0.015

Potential for toxicity
 
Many eye medications contain preservatives (e.g. benzalkonium chloride or BAC) that are toxic to the ocular surface. Cytotoxic assays have confirmed this and showed significant toxicity proportional to the concentration of BAC and its effects in causing ocular surface disease.
 
Another emerging problem with the prostaglandin-class of medications (e.g. latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost) has been the dose-related incidence of orbitopathy (or sunken orbits). The associations between prostaglandin analogue use and deepening of the upper lid sulci and between prostaglandin analogue use and loss of inferior periorbital fat have been reported to have a 230-fold increased risk of skin tissue shrinking around the eye.

Our Solution 
 


The Optejet delivers doses of 6 – 8 µL, directly coating the corneal surface where 80% of intraocular drug penetration occurs. We believe that microdosing may reduce drug and toxic preservative exposure by more than 75%, thus reducing ocular irritation, and resulting in potentially gentler treatments without compromising the desired clinical effect. Our approach could also reduce inadvertent waste associated with poor administration of conventional macrodose drops.
 
We believe that we are one of the only companies with clinical stage technology for targeted microdosing of ophthalmic investigational therapies. The Optejet is based on piezo-print technology, which is also used for pixel-sharp high-precision inkjet printing. The technology is optimized for and applied in ophthalmic delivery to achieve microdosing that can be many times more precise than conventional eye droppers. In addition, our smart, electronic system provides the capability to track when patients administer their medications and deliver this information to patients and physicians via Bluetooth connectivity. Thus, physicians can make decisions regarding therapeutic regimens with knowledge of patient compliance.
 
The FDA has provided written feedback that our clinical development activities will be treated as drug development programs, because only the drug comes into contact with the eye. Consequently, we do not anticipate needing separate FDA approval for the Optejet dispenser or being required to comply with FDA medical device regulations.
 
Microdose administration of topical ophthalmic drugs with the Optejet has been tested in preclinical models and clinical trials and shown to provide many advantages over administrations of eye drops. Key advantages of the Optejet include:
 
Dose reduction: Our microdose delivery technology is designed to achieve precise volumetric control at the microliter level to deliver 6–8 µL, which is the physiologic capacity of the tear film. This compares favorably to the volume of an eye drop (30–50 µL), which can result in overdosing, ocular toxicity and systemic leaching into the plasma.
 

Targeted dose instillation: The Optejet allows for targeted delivery to the ocular surface and cornea, avoiding the conjunctival cul-de-sac. The micro-jet spray created by the piezo-electric vibrations is columnated and focused to provide accurate delivery to the corneal surface where the majority of ocular penetration occurs. Additionally, the Optejet is designed with an LED targeting mechanism to facilitate proper positioning and objective alignment, thus increasing the likelihood of successful dose delivery.

Speed of delivery: Our piezo-print technology is similar to high-precision ink-jet printing. Unlike a simple aerosolized mechanism, the Optejet is designed with ejection control that creates a fast and targeted micro-jet delivery. Solution is dispensed to the ocular surface in approximately 80 milliseconds, beating the eye’s 100-millisecond blink reflex.
 

 Smart electronics: Our smart electronics and mobile e-health technology are designed to track when a patient administers treatment. This enables physicians to monitor patient compliance. We believe this technology will improve compliance and chronic disease management by empowering patients and physicians with access to dynamic, real time monitoring and compliance data for a more intelligent and personalized therapeutic paradigm.
 
Clinical Trial Results
 
We have an established platform for microdose administration of ophthalmic solutions. Our preclinical and clinical studies suggest that a 7 µL (±2) microdose of medication delivers clinical efficacy comparable to that of traditional eye drops, but with the advantages of fewer ocular side effects and less systemic exposure. We can use our platform technology on either new molecular entities or with existing molecular entities in order to improve their safety profile. We have chosen the latter path for our initial pipeline product candidates. 
 
To date, we have conducted multiple preclinical studies and three early phase clinical trials to validate our piezo-print microdose delivery platform. Our microdose approach was studied in preclinical studies to demonstrate pharmacodynamic equivalence of our targeted micro-therapeutic formulations and to assess whether microdosing can achieve comparable biologic activity with its significantly lower levels of drug and preservative exposure to the ocular tissues. Data from a canine model of glaucoma demonstrated more than 40% IOP lowering effect at microdose of 8–9 µL latanoprost. Another independent microdose study published in the Journal of Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science in 2014 further demonstrated that 3 µL microdose with timolol 0.5% can reduce systemic plasma levels of the drug by a factor of 17.

IOP Lowering Effect of Micro-Therapeutic Dose of Latanoprost in Canine Model
 

Two of our clinical trials investigated the pharmacodynamic equivalence and clinical advantages of our microdose approach for achievement of mydriasis. In these studies, we compared pupil dilation with a microdose of phenylephrine versus a traditional phenylephrine eye drop, and also the rate of side effects with microdosing as opposed to eye drops. Results of these two studies suggest that the Optejet can deliver equivalent therapeutic activity as conventional eye drop dosing while reducing the incidence of side effects. 
 
The EYN-1601 clinical trial, referred to as EYN, compared the mydriatic pharmacodynamic effect of phenylephrine 10% microdosed (~ 7 µL in volume) with the Optejet to phenylephrine 10% (PE 10%) and phenylephrine 2.5% (PE 2.5%) eye drops (each ~32 µL in volume) in 24 subject eyes. At 75-minute peak dilation, our microdose provided similar mydriatic results (at one quarter of the dose exposure) to the 10% phenylephrine drops, and superior activity compared to 2.5% phenylephrine drops.

This study was also informative with regard to systemic drug exposure of topical treatments. As shown below, microdosed phenylephrine 10% (EYN1) demonstrated 35–40% lower plasma levels of the drug as compared with phenylephrine 10% eye drops (PE 10%).
 

As shown in the table below (Ocular AEs by Treatment), there were also fewer ocular adverse events in the microdose group and our microdose administered phenylephrine 10% (EYN) suggested an improvement in tolerability as compared to 10% phenylephrine eye drops (PE 10%).

Ocular burning/stinging/irritation | | 4 | | 1
Ocular dryness | | 2 | | 0
Subtotal by Treatment Group | | 7 | | 1

 
The EYE-103 study investigated a combination of phenylephrine and tropicamide treatment administered using the Optejet compared to conventional eye drops in 102 subjects (204 eyes). In this study, microdosing produced equivalent dilation to eye drops and 91% of participants preferred medication administration with the Optejet versus eye drops (6% preferred eye drops, while 3% expressed no preference [p < 0.0001]). On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most favorable, general satisfaction scores were higher with Optejet administration versus eye drops (9.8 ± 0.6 for Optejet vs 5.8 ± 3.0 for eye drops). Ocular comfort scores were nearly two times better with the Optejet than with eye drops.
 

In 2018, Eyenovia completed a third trial (EYN-POC-PG-21) to extend the findings of the two previous trials evaluating Optejet administration of mydriatic agents. This study was a single-center, open-label, prospective, crossover design evaluating the usability, patient tolerability, and proof-of-concept of microdose administration of commercial latanoprost 0.005% using the Optejet. Thirty healthy volunteer subjects (60 eyes) were evaluated for eligibility and consented to study participation. Subsequently, at each of three treatment visits, IOP was measured in the morning. Afterwards, on Treatment Days 1 and 2, a single 8-µL microdose of latanoprost 0.005% opthalmic solution was administered to each eye using the Optejet. On the morning of Treatment Day 3, each subject received 2 × 8-µL Optejet microdoses (administered approximately 5 minutes apart) in one eye and the other eye received a single eye drop of latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution. For each treatment day, IOP was measured 1, 7, 12, and 24 hours after receiving medication and a mean diurnal IOP (DIOP) was calculated from the four readings. As shown below, mean DIOP after medication administration on Days 1 and 2 was lowered by 25.0% and 28.7%, respectively.

As shown below, on Day 3, mean DIOP was 35.5% lower than baseline for eyes receiving microdose latanoprost 0.005% using the Optejet, and was 35.0% lower than than baseline for eyes receiving a single drop of latanoprost 0.005%.

DIOP at Day 3 (N=29 Eyes of 29 Subjects per Treatment)
 
No clinically significant changes were noted in slit lamp observations (including hyperemia) for any subjects who received study treatment and there were no adverse events. Subjects reported no-to-negligible ocular discomfort after medication administration using the Optejet.
 
Investigator-administered medication using the Optejet was evaluated in 60 eyes (1 spray/eye) on Days 1 and 2, and in 30 eyes (2 sprays/eye) on Day 3. Microdose administration was successful on the first attempt in 172 of the 180 cases (96%). Subject head movement and/or blinking and investigator proficiency with Optejet use resulted in the need for additional administration in the remaining 4% of cases, the majority of which (6/8) occurred on Day 1. Administration success was achieved on the first attempt on all Day 3 cases. There were no reports of unintentional overdosing, tear fluid overflow, or dispenser nozzle touching the eye.
 
In a separate evaluation, subjects were trained on Optejet self-administration with sterile water and then asked to demonstrate Optejet use in each eye during the afternoon of each treatment day. By the afternoon of Day 3, qualified Eyenovia representatives judged that almost 90% of subjects were able to demonstrate accurate self-administration using the Optejet.
 
This study demonstated Optejet medication administration to be easy to perform, safe, and comfortable to study subjects. Additionally, Optejet microdose administration of 0.005% latanoprost resulted in mean DIOP reduction similar to reported literaure for use of latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution administered as traditional eye drops.
 
Based on the results of multiple front-of-the-eye studies, we initiated Phase III programs in mydriasis in late 2018 and plan to initiate our Phase III program in progressive myopia in 2019.
 
Our Product Candidates
 
MicroStat 
 
MicroStat is the potentially first-in-class fixed combination micro-formulation product candidate for mydriasis (eye dilation) intended to facilitate the estimated 80 million office-based comprehensive and diabetic eye exams and four million ophthalmic surgical dilations performed every year in the United States. Our fixed combination product has been developed to help achieve efficient pupil dilation while reducing unintended effects of conventionally administered mydriatic agents. We believe the market for MicroStat exceeds $250 million in the United States alone.
Background of Mydriasis and Market Opportunity
 
There are more than an estimated 80 million topical mydriatic applications performed every year as a required part of the comprehensive dilated eye exam and standard retina fundoscopy for diabetic retinopathy screening, macular degeneration evaluation, glaucoma optic disc evaluation and many other back-of-the-eye conditions. There are an additional estimated four million applications for ocular surgery. Most optometrist and ophthalmologist offices have multiple bottles of both phenylephrine and tropicamide and use each bottle on multiple patients, which carries a risk of contaminating patients’ eyes and spreading infections. The bottles are purchased directly from suppliers and are not subject to insurance reimbursement. Our combination therapy, if approved, will allow the purchase of one product for eye dilation, and our system does not come in direct contact with the eye, thus minimizing the risk of infection.
 
Most dilated eye exams require two separate topical pharmacologic agents/drops be administered sequentially (tropicamide and phenylephrine). All current mydriatic formulations use conventional macrodose drop delivery (30–50 µL), which can significantly overdose the ocular surface whose physiologic capacity is only 6–8 µL. Studies demonstrate that standard macrodosed pharmacologic dilation is associated with significant ocular discomfort and mild-moderate eye pain. On the standard visual analogue scale for pain, such discomfort can exceed the levels of pain associated with a flu vaccine subcutaneous injection. Additionally, there are systemic safety concerns with mydriatic macrodosing for retinopathy of prematurity retinal screening and pediatric dilated eye exams. Studies comparing microdosed phenylephrine and cyclopentolate to traditional eye drops (30–50 µL drop size) in premature babies and in full-term infants have shown equivalent pupil dilation with drop sizes ranging from 5–8 µL while reducing systemic levels by more than 50%.

With millions of patients exposed to mydriatic pharmacologic agents every year, we are developing a microdose alternative whereby the Optejet can be deployed to reduce ocular and systemic exposure by more than 75%. This potential improvement stems from lowering the dose from the 30–50 µL in standard drops to just 8 µL with MicroStat combined with targeted delivery to the ocular surface. We expect to achieve similar mydriatic activity as drops without the high incidence of unwanted side effects.
 

Pharmacologic mydriasis: dilated pupil after application
 
Phase III Clinical Development Program
 
We initiated Phase III clinical trials of fixed-combination microdosed phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1% administered for mydriasis in November 2018.
 
The MicroStat program consisted of two Phase III randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical studies evaluating pupil dilation with our fixed combination product (MicroStat) in comparison with the individual drug components (phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1%, respectively) (the MIST-1 Study), and with a placebo (the MIST-2 Study). The primary endpoint for each study was the mean change in pupil diameter at 35 minutes post-drug administration.
 
The MIST-1 Study was a double-masked, active-controlled, three-period cross-over superiority study evaluating MicroStat ophthalmic solution versus the two individual drug components contained in MicroStat (phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1% ophthalmic solutions). All study drugs were administered using the Optejet.
 
Volunteer participants were evaluated for study eligibility during a screening visit and enrolled after providing study consent. Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria were scheduled for three treatment visits, which occurred at least two days, but no more than seven days apart. At each treatment visit, baseline measurements were taken, then one of the three study drugs was administered to both eyes in two separate instances, approximately five minutes apart. Afterwards, efficacy and safety assessments were performed at specific time intervals, including pupil diameter measured by digital pupillometry in highly photopic conditions established by using a fully-charged transilluminator at the brightest setting. Subjects were equally randomized to receive all three treatments according to one of the six possible sequences of study drug administration.
 
The MIST-1 study was double-masked so that there were no differences in drug presentation. Study drug administration was performed by seven different trained personnel during the trial. To maintain masking, personnel who administered study drug were not allowed to perform post-drug administration ophthalmic assessments.
 
A total of 64 subjects were randomized to receive the study drug. Two subjects withdrew after the first treatment visit; therefore, the resulting per-protocol analysis population consisted of 62 subjects (124 eyes). Mean pupil diameter for each eye at baseline and at 35 minutes post-drug administration is shown graphically below. At 35 minutes, the treatment group difference between MicroStat and tropicamide 1% was 0.440 mm (SE 0.1839), which was statistically significant (p = 0.0183). The treatment group difference between MicroStat and phenylephrine 2.5% at the same timepoint was 3.638 mm (SE 0.1817), which was also statistically significant (p <0.0001). Since the null hypothesis was rejected for both sets of comparisons, the primary endpoint was met.

As shown below, at 35 minutes post-drug administration, MicroStat achieved a clinically meaningful pupil diameter ≥ 6.0 mm in 95.2% of right eyes and 93.5% of left eyes compared to a lower proportion for tropicamide 1% (79.0% and 77.4% of right and left eyes, respectively) and for phenylephrine 2.5% (1.6% for both right and left eyes). MicroStat also achieved a pupil diameter ≥ 7.0 mm in 67.7% of right and left eyes compared to a lower proportion for tropicamide 1% (43.5% and 41.9% or right and left eyes, respectively) and for phenylephrine 2.5% (0% for right and left eyes).

The rate of treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, was low, and consistent with those observed with commercially available dilating eye drops (e.g. blurry vision and stinging). Two TEAEs were reported in the MicroStat eyes, while four TEAEs were reported in each of the other two treatment groups. All events were mild in nature. No non-ocular adverse events were reported.
 
The MIST-2 Study was a multi-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover superiority study evaluating MicroStat ophthalmic solution versus placebo. Both study drugs were administered using the Optejet.
 
Volunteer participants were evaluated for study eligibility during a screening visit and enrolled after providing study consent. Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria were scheduled for three treatment visits, which occurred at least two days, but no more than seven days apart. A two-sequence, three-period crossover design was used. At each treatment visit, baseline measurements were taken, then either the investigational drug or the placebo was administered to both eyes in two separate instances, approximately five minutes apart. Only one study drug was administered per treatment visit, and subjects were equally randomized to one of two sequences, ABB and BAA, where A was the Eyenovia fixed combination and B was placebo. Afterwards, efficacy and safety assessments were performed at specific time intervals, including pupil diameter measured by digital pupillometry in highly photopic conditions established by using a fully-charged transilluminator at the brightest setting.

Like MIST-1, this study was double-masked so that there were no differences in drug presentation. Study drug administration was performed by five different trained personnel and, to maintain masking, personnel who administered study drug were not allowed to perform post-drug administration ophthalmic assessments.
 
A total of 70 subjects at two investigational sites were randomized to receive study drug. One subject withdrew after the first treatment visit; therefore, the resulting per-protocol analysis population consisted of 69 subjects (138 eyes). Mean pupil diameter for each eye at baseline and at 35 minutes post-drug administration is shown graphically below. At 35 minutes, the treatment group difference between MicroStat and placebo was 4.63 mm (SE 0.0544), which was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001); consequently, the null hypothesis was rejected and the primary endpoint was met.
 
Pupil Diameter by Eye and Treatment at Baseline and 35 Minutes (PP Population)
 

Mean ± Standard Deviation
 
As shown in the table below, at 35 minutes post-drug administration, MicroStat achieved a clinically meaningful pupil diameter ≥ 6.0 mm in 92.8%% of right eyes and 94.2% of left eyes and pupil diameter ≥ 7.0 mm in 69.6% of right and 68.1% of left eyes. None of the eyes in the placebo group achieved similar dilation.
 
Proportion of Eyes Achieving Pupil Diameter ≥ 6.0 mm and ≥ 7.0 mm at 35 Minutes (PP Population)
 

35 Min Post Dose | MicroStat | | | Placebo 
---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----+----------
Combined Visits (1, 2, 3) | OD (N=69) | | | OS (N=69) | | OD (N=69) | OS (N=69) | 
Pupil diameter ≥ 6.0 mm | | 64 ( 92.8 | )% | | 65 ( 94.2 | )% | 0 | | 0 | 
Pupil diameter < 6.0 mm | | 5 ( 7.2 | )% | | 4 ( 5.8 | )% | 69 (100.0 | )% | 69 (100.0 | )
Pupil diameter ≥ 7.0 mm | | 48 ( 69.6 | )% | | 47 ( 68.1 | )% | 0 | | 0 | 
Pupil diameter < 7.0 mm | | 21 ( 30.4 | )% | | 22 ( 31.9 | )% | 69 (100.0 | )% | 69 (100.0 | )

 
Two TEAEs (one event of mild instillation site pain and one event of moderate photophobia) were reported in the MicroStat group, while none were reported with the use of placebo. No non-ocular adverse events were reported.
 
The outcomes of MIST-1 and MIST-2 are consistent. As shown below, in both studies, MicroStat achieved a mean change in pupil size between 4.6 mm and 4.8 mm at 35 minutes post-dose. In both studies, between 93% and 95% of eyes treated with the fixed combination mydriatic drug achieved a pupil diameter ≥ 6.0 mm at this same timepoint. Additionally, in MIST-1, the median time to maximum post-baseline pupil diameter with ≥ 1.0 mm increase from baseline for fixed combination solution was 73.0 minutes, while in MIST-2, it was 71.0 minutes.

Efficacy of MicroStat in MIST-1 and MIST-2 Studies (PP Populations)
 

 | MIST-1 | MIST-2 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------
Mean change in pupil diameter from baseline at 35 minutes | 4.6 mm right eyes 4.7 mm left eyes | 4.7 mm right eyes 4.8 mm left eyes 
Proportion of eyes with pupil diameter ≥ 6.0 mm at 35 minutes | 95.2% of right eyes 93.5% of left eyes | 92.8% of right eyes 94.2% of left eyes
Median time to maximum post-baseline pupil diameter with ≥ 1.0 mm increase from baseline | 73.0 minutes | 71.0 minutes 

 
The consistency of these results validates the robustness of the study designs and demonstrates the impressive treatment effect of MicroStat. More generally, these outcomes serve to further validate the bioavailability and efficacy of Optejet drug administration to the ocular surface.
 
With the primary objectives of our Phase III program met, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval in the United States in 2020. Outside the United States, we have entered into a licensing partnership for MicroStat with Senju Pharmaceuticals for commercialization in Asia, including China, Japan and India.
 
MicroPine 
 
A key therapeutic program for Eyenovia is our first-in-class topical treatment for progressive myopia, a back-of-the-eye disease.
 
Background of Progressive Myopia and Market Opportunity
 
Progressive myopia is estimated to affect close to five million patients in the United States who suffer from uncontrolled axial elongation of the sclera leading to increasing levels of myopia and in some cases major pathologic changes such as retinal atrophy, macular staphylomas, retinal detachment and visual impairment.
Progressive Myopia with Retinal Atrophy Changes


Academic groups have demonstrated that high efficacy with low dose atropine reduces myopia progression 60-70%, with sustained effect through three years. A recent therapeutic evidence assessment and review by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, indicates Level 1 (highest) evidence of efficacy for the role of low dose atropine for progressive myopia (Ophthalmology 2017;124:1857-1866; Ophthalmology 2016; 123(2) 391:399)). While atropine 1% ophthalmic solution is commercially available, we believe the significant side effects associated with its use in the pediatric population make its use undesirable for the treatment of progressive myopia.

We recently initiated the development of a micro-formulation of atropine for moderate to severe myopia (nearsightedness), an ocular disorder in which the optical power of the eye is too strong for the corresponding ocular anatomy. Myopia is the most common refractive error requiring correction seen in children. It is estimated that there are over 80 million children diagnosed with myopia worldwide and over 5 million in the United States. While currently there are no FDA-approved therapies for myopia progression, there is growing evidence of the therapeutic activity of topical atropine, an anticholinergic agent used for dilation, as a treatment to slow progression. Despite activity, safety concerns such as pupil dilation, photosensitivity and accommodation difficulties associated with standard atropine, 1% have tempered initial clinical adoption. While macrodose atropine 1% is currently FDA-approved for pupil dilation in the United States, its significant side effect profile has impeded clinical utility and adoption for myopia progression.
 
Phase III Clinical Development Program
 
We have received IND approval for MicroPine and expect to initiate our Phase III clinical trial in 2019. We expect the clinical trial to be a U.S.-based, multi-center, randomized, double-masked trial that will enroll more than 400 children and adolescents who will use MicroPine therapy daily for four years. Participants will be equally randomized to receive treatment with either of two MicroPine treatment concentrations or a placebo control arm. The primary assessment of efficacy is based on reduction in myopia progression at three years, with a fourth year of follow-up required to assess any rebound effects associated with a change in the medication regimen. If the primary objectives of our Phase III program are met, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval of MicroPine to slow the progression of myopia under the 505(b)(2) pathway.
 
MicroProst 
 
MicroProst is our proprietary latanoprost formulation product candidate, which is being developed as a first-line treatment for reduction of IOP in patients with CACG, OAG and OHT. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for CACG, which accounts for an estimated 10% and 50% of all glaucoma diagnoses in the United States and China, respectively.
 
Background of Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma, Open Angle Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension and Market Opportunity
 
CACG, OAG and OHT are well characterized and clinically diagnosed disease entities, as established by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Patterns. CACG and OAG are characterized by increased IOP and optic neuropathy, while OHT patients are often at risk for optic neuropathy. According to the Johns Hopkins Glaucoma Center of Excellence, there are approximately three million CACG and OAG patients in the United States, and approximately five million additional ocular hypertensives who may be at risk for developing glaucoma, as demonstrated below.

We believe that MicroProst could become a first-line option for treating elevated IOP, competing with other prostaglandin analogues in OAG, CACG and OHT. We estimate the addressable market for MicroProst exceeds $1.5 billion in the United States alone.
 
The mainstay of glaucoma treatment for both open and angle-closure glaucoma is IOP lowering with pharmacologic therapy. While IOP lowering pharmacotherapies have been FDA indicated and approved for IOP lowering in open-angle glaucoma, none have been specifically studied in FDA trials nor indicated for CACG, which is a less prevalent disease. Despite the unmet need and the fact that over approximately 90% of CACG patients continue to require chronic lifelong IOP-lowering therapy, many physicians continue to use off-label treatments without the support of rigorous clinical trials and data. Therapeutic control is particularly important for CACG patients where it has been well established that optic nerve damage is more IOP-dependent than that of open-angle glaucoma and CACG patients progress two times more quickly than open-angle glaucoma patients.
 
There is strong clinical evidence from multiple studies as well as a more recent randomized controlled study published in the Archives of Ophthalmology that latanoprost and timolol cause significant IOP lowering in patients with CACG — 35% and 26%, respectively. Even though there has been no FDA-approved therapy, peer-reviewed and published clinical trials demonstrate robust therapeutic effect of latanoprost in CACG, which is highly informative for our forthcoming Phase III clinical trial. A randomized controlled study in 60 eyes published in the peer-reviewed journal, Archives of Ophthalmology, shows not only a high level of IOP lowering effect of 8.2 mmHg at three months, but also superiority to active timolol control which only lowered IOP by 6.1 mmHg.

Diumal Variation of IOP at Baseline and After Three Months of Therapy 
 With Latanoprost and Timolol in 60 Eyes
 

 | | Latanoprost | Timolol Maleate 
-----------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------+-----------------
 | | | Decrease in IOP | | Decrease in IOP 
Time of IOP Recording | Mean ± SD Baseline IOP, mm Hg | Mean ± SD IOP, mm Hg | Mean ± SD, mm Hg | % | Mean ± SD IOP, mm Hg | Mean ± SD, mm Hg | % | P Value
7 AM | 23.5 ± 3.1 | 14.0 ± 2.2 | 9.5 ± 3.3 | 40.4 | 18.3 ± 3.2 | 5.2 ± 3.6 | 22.1 | <.01 
10 AM | 24.6 ± 3.9 | 14.6 ± 2.8 | 10.0 ± 4.3 | 40.6 | 17.9 ± 3.6 | 6.7 ± 3.5 | 27.2 | <.01 
1 PM | 23.6 ± 2.7 | 16.2 ± 2.7 | 7.4 ± 3.4 | 31.4 | 17.1 ± 3.2 | 6.5 ± 3.8 | 27.5 | .04 
4 PM | 23.2 ± 2.7 | 15.7 ± 3.4 | 7.5 ± 3.3 | 32.3 | 17.7 ± 3.9 | 5.6 ± 3.7 | 24.1 | <.01 
7 PM | 22.4 ± 3.1 | 15.6 ± 3.1 | 6.8 ± 3.4 | 30.4 | 16.9 ± 3.8 | 5.6 ± 3.9 | 25.0 | .01 
10 PM | 23.3 ± 2.9 | 15.6 ± 3.0 | 7.6 ± 3.9 | 32.6 | 16.3 ± 3.4 | 6.9 ± 3.6 | 29.6 | .25 
Mean | 23.4 ± 2.1 | 15.3 ± 1.8 | 8.2 ± 2.0 | 34.9 | 17.4 ± 1.7 | 6.1 ± 1.7 | 26.0 | <.01 

 
Additionally, 72% of patients taking latanoprost and 43% of patients taking timolol achieved more than 30% IOP lowering from baseline. Similarly, another randomized controlled study demonstrated an 8.8 mmHg IOP reduction with latanoprost and 5.7 mmHg reduction with timolol in patients with CACG. Data from these studies not only suggest the biologic therapeutic effect of IOP lowering in CACG, but also highlight the undesirable associated safety profile of macrodosing such as hyperemia and ocular discomfort, which caused significant adverse events in more than 40% of patients. Based on these studies and the data from the open-angle glaucoma disease therapeutic paradigm, we believe MicroProst may demonstrate IOP lowering and an improved safety profile for CACG patients in our planned Phase III clinical trial. If approved, MicroProst would be the only first-line medication that is FDA-approved in CACG, OAG and OHT.
 
Phase III Clinical Development Program 
 
Subsequent to the completion of early phase clinical trials, we met with the FDA to discuss our Phase III plans for MicroProst. The FDA outlined the necessary clinical trials for approval and we are preparing to initiate a Phase III registration program for MicroProst relying on the 505(b)(2) pathway in 2019. If approved, we believe MicroProst will have the widest indication of commercially available IOP-lowering therapies, including the first FDA-approved treatment for CACG. Based on the results of our earlier study of Optejet-administered latanoprost (EYNPG-21), we believe MicroProst will achieve similar clinical efficacy without the adverse effects seen with conventional drops, which overdose the eye with potentially harmful preservatives and active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API.
 
We anticipate that the MicroProst clinical program will require a single Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial involving patients with OHT, POAG and CACG, with a three-month primary endpoint evaluating IOP reduction and follow-up through six months for safety. We plan to begin the clinical trial for MicroProst in 2019. We have entered into a licensing partnership for our MicroProst program with Senju Pharmaceuticals for Asia, including China where it is estimated that CACG accounts for up to 50% of all glaucoma.
 
MicroTears 
 
MicroTears is a micro-droplet ocular hyperemia (red eye), pruritis (itch) and ocular lubrication product candidate for an estimated $850 million ocular OTC market in the United States. The Optejet can enable accurate delivery of MicroTears directly to the ocular surface, which we believe enhances its effectiveness. The lower volume of MicroTears could also lower the incidents of droplet overflow and potentially reduce the risk of therapeutic rebound from the ocular decongestant, where over time these products may lose their effectiveness. While no FDA studies are required for registration of a monograph formulation, we expect to conduct multiple Phase IV post-marketing studies to demonstrate the benefits of MicroTears. We plan to complete formulation and manufacturing scale-up activities for an expected market introduction in 2019.

Background of Ocular hyperemia, Pruritis and Dry Eye Syndrome and Market Opportunity
 
Ocular hyperemia (red eye) is caused by dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva. The increased diameter of the blood vessels can cause the conjunctiva to take on a diffuse pink color. Common causes of hyperemia include allergies, morning eye congestion (when irritants become caught in the tear film overnight), dry eye and contact lens wear.
 
Ocular pruritis (itch) is a common symptom that can impact a patient’s quality of life. Pruritis can be caused by keratoconjunctivitis, allergies, dry eye syndrome, meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharitis and contact lens wear.
 
Dry eye syndrome, or DES, is a common yet complex ocular condition caused by decreased tear production and/or increased tear evaporation. It is a chronic, episodic, multifactorial disease affecting the tears and ocular surface that can result in tear film instability, inflammation, discomfort, visual disturbance, and potential damage to the ocular surface. DES can have a significant impact on quality of life. In addition, the vast majority of DES patients experience acute exacerbations of their symptoms, which are commonly referred to as flares, at various times throughout the year. 
 
All three of these conditions can be triggered by numerous factors, including exposure to allergens, pollution, wind and low humidity, intense visual concentration such as watching television and working at a computer, contact lens wear, smoking and sleep deprivation, which can cause ocular surface inflammation and impact tear production and/or tear film stability.
 
An estimated over 20 million people in the United States suffer from the symptoms of dry eye and many more have had episodes of ocular hyperemia or pruritis. An estimated 25% of patients visiting ophthalmology clinics in the United States report dry eye symptoms. While many patients receive prescriptions for dry eye symptoms, the majority of patients with ocular hyperemia or pruritis opt for OTC products. The OTC market for these conditions is approximately $850 million annually in the United States. We believe MicroTears will offer meaningful improvements over other OTC options, by improved accuracy in delivering the medication, better ocular coating, lower incidence of medication running down the patient’s face and potentially a lower incidence of ocular decongestant rebound due to microdosing of the active ingredient.
 
Our Technology 
 
The Optejet comes in two parts:
 

• | the base contains the electronic components which enable generation of control signals designed to ensure consistent, accurate columnated arrays of micro-droplets, as well as dose tracking via Bluetooth connectivity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the disposable cartridge which contains the drug formulation in a primary drug container, targeted dosing system and piezo-driven ejector nozzle, and comes in one-month doses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For administration of our product candidates, the patient receives both the base and the disposable cartridge. For refills, the patient receives only the disposable cartridge. Patients deliver their dose by attaching the cartridge to the base, pressing an activation button which loads a single drug dose, then, holding it between one and two inches from the eye while looking directly into an illuminated circle, pressing a second button to emit the micro-droplet delivered medication. The micro-droplets are emitted in a quickly repeating array, that in aggregate form a micro-jet. Solution is dispensed to the ocular surface in approximately 80 milliseconds, which beats the blink reflex of the eye and enables the medication to coat the ocular surface while not flooding the eye’s tear capacity. The patient feels a wet sensation on the eye, but does not experience any pain, as demonstrated in studies to date. Several acute clinical trials have been performed to date that demonstrate the Optejet’s usability. As a precise and quick-delivered microdose, it does not drip down the face or drain down the naso-lacrimal duct thereby minimizing delivery of extra product or preservatives to the eye. The rechargeable base has intelligent power management and precision designed circuitry that maximizes battery life allowing for infrequent recharging, while providing consistent dose delivery over the life of each cartridge.

Our system is based on piezo-driven printer technology, which is also used for high-precision ink jet printing. In ink jet printing, piezo technology enables ink to be sprayed with precision to form letters and numbers on paper. Our patented system takes aspects of piezo driven printer technology, and applies it to the delivery of therapeutics to the eye.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
In light of our development stage, our commercial organization is focused on establishing relationships with potential strategic partners, key opinion leaders and medical organizations. These relationships will be important to the rapid acceptance and uptake of our products once they become available. We are also assessing sales, reimbursement and distribution strategies to maximize the value of our assets in development. We have licensed commercialization rights in Asia to Senju Pharmaceuticals and have retained global commercial rights for our product candidates in all other regions. As partial consideration, Senju Pharmaceuticals purchased $5 million of our Series A preferred stock in April 2015 (which subsequently converted to shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering). Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Senju Pharmaceuticals also agreed to pay us royalties equal to 5% of the net sales (excluding manufacturing costs, rebates and other charges) for the licensed products sold by Senju Pharmaceuticals on a semi-annual basis until the expiration of all patents or pending patent applications covering such licensed product, at which time the royalty rate will be reduced to 1%. The royalty payment will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the latter of the 10th year of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in any country or the expiration of the licensed patents. Upon expiration of the agreement, Senju Pharmaceuticals will own an exclusive, fully paid up, irrevocable and perpetual license. The exclusive license agreement may be terminated by either party for any material breach by the other party that is not cured within 90 days of receipt of written notice by the breaching party. If so terminated by Senju Pharmaceuticals, the license will survive the termination with no further payment obligations to us. If so terminated by us, the license will terminate and Senju Pharmaceuticals will transfer all rights to regulatory approvals to us, with no refund or recovery of any development costs. Senju Pharmaceuticals may also terminate the exclusive license agreement without cause upon 60 days written notice on a country-by-country basis, in which event Senju Pharmaceuticals will transfer all rights to regulatory approvals pertaining to any licensed product to us.
 
If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States through a combination of distributors, specialty pharmacies and our own specialty sales force. We expect to work with distribution companies or through other marketing arrangements in the European Union and other regions outside the United States We believe that the U.S. commercial organization will initially consist of approximately 15 sales and marketing professionals and, upon approval of MicroPine, grow to approximately 100 individuals calling on ophthalmologists and optometrists. We expect to make hires and sign distribution agreements for commercialization following NDA approval of any of our product candidates. Our management team and directors, which would lead the commercialization planning of our lead product candidates, have substantial experience in the commercialization of ophthalmic therapeutics.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We currently rely on a combination of internal manufacturing capacity and third-party manufacturers to produce the product candidates for our clinical trials. We manage such production with all our vendors on a purchase order basis. Relationships with vendors of critical components are governed by applicable service and supply agreements or purchase order terms. We do not currently have long-term agreements with these manufacturers or any other third-party suppliers. We intend to procure quantities on a purchase order basis for our clinical and initial commercial production. If any of our existing third-party suppliers should become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might experience a delay in our ability to obtain alternately sourced quantities of materials or services due to their unique and specialized nature. We also do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of our product candidates if they are approved. With respect to commercial production of our product candidates in the future, we plan to outsource production of the majority of the product candidates if they are approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Competition 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic or biosimilar drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring products, product candidates or other technologies that we may target to in-license or acquire in pursuit of our updated business plan.
 
For MicroStat, we are not aware of any micro-therapeutics nor of any existing FDA-approved phenylephrine-tropicamide topical fixed combination even in standard macrodose. There are competitive macrodose drop formulations of individual therapeutics such as phenylephrine and tropicamide for mydriasis by companies such as Akorn, Alcon and others, as well as pharmacies that compound the combination on an individual basis for physicians.
 
For MicroPine, we are not aware of any FDA-approved therapies to slow the progression of myopia.
 
For the MicroProst program, there are currently no FDA-approved prostaglandin therapies for chronic angle closure glaucoma and we are not aware of any in ongoing FDA registration studies. Physicians currently use off-label IOP lowering medications that are FDA-approved for a different disease entity, namely open-angle glaucoma.
 
For MicroTears, there is an estimated $850 million U.S. market of OTC medications including ocular decongestants and artificial tears with an aggregate of 200 million units sold annually in the United States, but none that we are aware of with targeted, ocular surface coating micro-droplet delivery. We believe the benefits of microdosing as well as simplicity and convenience of our MicroTears system, which can be administered without tilting the head and with minimal risk of inconveniences such as dripping down the patient’s cheek, can differentiate our product from other OTC products.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Our success may depend on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our proprietary rights related to our products and other technologies. We must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others while preventing others from infringing our proprietary rights. We will seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications. We may also rely on trade secrets and know-how for some proprietary methods, methods of manufacture, and systems and devices. We continue innovating our technologies, and will file appropriate U.S. and foreign patent applications for our future innovations.
Patents
 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned seven U.S. issued utility patents, one issued design patent, and nine pending U.S. patent applications, as well as 33 issued foreign patents, 41 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending international PCT application.
 
Patent coverage within the portfolio includes issued and pending patent applications disclosing and claiming the following devices and methods:
 

• | A piezoelectric device configured to generate an ejected stream of droplets is the subject of one patent family. The device ejects droplets having an average ejected droplet diameter greater than 20 microns and an average initial droplet ejecting velocity between 0.5 m/s and 10 m/s. Furthermore, the stream of droplets is generated with low entrained airflow so that at least 75% of the mass is deposited on the eye. U.S. patents for these devices are expected to expire in 2031.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A method of delivering a medicament or solution to an eye with a piezo-ejector device is the subject of another patent family. The method involves delivering an average droplet size of 20 microns to 100 microns in diameter with an average initial droplet ejecting velocity between 1 m/s and 10 m/s to the eye. About 85% to 100% of the ejected mass of droplets is deposited on the eye. U.S. patents for these methods are expected to expire in 2031.

• | A device having a piezo-ejector that generates a directed stream of droplets through specially shaped openings in the piezo-ejector is the subject of still another patent family. The openings provide laminar flow through the openings. Laminar flow is provided by shaping the openings with a gradual slope change so that an external entry radius has a circular shape which reduces airflow while providing laminar flow through the openings. U.S. patents related to these devices are expected to expire in 2033.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A piezo-electric ejector device having a microcontroller which auto-tunes the ejector mechanism is the subject of another patent family. The device generates at least one cycle in a range of drive signal frequencies and obtains time-energy product feedback from a decay signal emitted by the actuator. U.S. patents related to these devices are expected to expire in 2033.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A method of monitoring the treatment of ophthalmic subjects by capturing images of the eye is the subject of another patent family. Images of the eye are taken which are sufficient to obtain information about the diagnosis or health of the eye. The data is stored and analyzed to monitor treatment. U.S. patents related to this method are expected to expire in 2031.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A fluid ejector having a fluid loading plate in parallel arrangement with an ejector mechanism is the subject of patent family patented in Europe. The fluid loading plate forms a capillary separation with the ejector mechanism to generate capillary fluid flow. The fluid loading plate is also attached to the reservoir (at a fluid reservoir interface) and to the ejector mechanism (at an ejector mechanism interface) and may have one or more fluid channels from the fluid reservoir interface to the ejector mechanism interface. The ejector produces a stream of droplets having a droplet diameter greater than 15 microns with the stream having low entrained airflow so that the pressure of the stream will be substantially imperceptible.

The expiry of any patent depends upon the legal term for patents in that particular country. In the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent. A patent term may also be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or application.
 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force.
 
A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension. Similar patent term extension/reduction provisions are available in the European Union and other jurisdictions. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we will apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering our products to the extent available under the applicable law, depending upon the length of any such clinical trials for any product and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension of a foreign patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
 
Government authorities in the United States, at federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with applicable requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA.

Preclinical Studies
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
The IND and IRB Processes
 
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that clinical trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.

Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase I. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials might not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. Eyenovia is currently eligible for a waiver of the application fees under the small business provisions.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within 10 months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. For applications of drug products that are not new molecular entities, FDA aims to conduct standard reviews within 10 months of receipt of the NDA and priority reviews within six months of receipt of the NDA. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical trials which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application “were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
 
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”
 

26
--

 

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred to as the Orange Book. Clinicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing clinicians or patient.
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA might not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
 
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval).
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension, in connection with any of our product candidates.
The 21st Century Cures Act 
 
On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 
With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Within this framework, manufacturers may seek approval of hybrid medicinal products under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Hybrid applications rely, in part, on information and data from a reference product and new data from appropriate preclinical tests and clinical trials. Such applications are necessary when the proposed product does not meet the strict definition of a generic medicinal product, or bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence, or there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product compared to the reference medicinal product. In such cases the results of tests and clinical trials must be consistent with the data content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC.

Hybrid medicinal product applications have automatic access to the centralized procedure when the reference product was authorized for marketing via that procedure. Where the reference product was authorized via the decentralized procedure, a hybrid application may be accepted for consideration under the centralized procedure if the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or the granting of a community authorization for the medicinal product is in the interest of patients at the community level.
 
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
 
Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are set forth in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the E.U. member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each E.U. member state in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.
 
In April 2014, the E.U. passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable. According to the current plans of EMA, the new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable in 2019. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system.
 
The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states; a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned, and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned); strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications; and the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 
Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 
In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.

Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
 
As in the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual E.U. Member States both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. The holder of an E.U. marketing authorization for a medicinal product must, for example, comply with E.U. pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the European Union is also highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable E.U. laws, including compliance with E.U. cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of approved products are subject to E.U. Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with clinicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual E.U. Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited in the European Union.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates might not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Third-party reimbursement might not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
 
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products might not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 
Arrangements with healthcare providers, pharmacists, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include without limitation the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which amended HIPAA to impose additional obligations, including mandatory contractual terms regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to clinicians and teaching hospitals and clinician ownership and investment interests; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been several federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control, and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or ACA, included provisions related to the coverage of and payment for prescription drugs under government healthcare programs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is designed to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, impose an annual fee on branded pharmaceutical manufacturers and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are:
 

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The ACA also included reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain health care providers. These reports must be submitted annually and are placed on a public database. If we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties. A related provision of the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical companies to annually report samples distributed to physicians, though the law does not include any specific penalties for failure to submit these reports.
 
The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
Pharmaceutical pricing has been a focus of the Trump administration, which has also continued efforts to repeal the ACA. It remains to be seen, however, what impact new legislation, if passed, will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The elimination of the ACA’s individual mandate, which imposed penalties to individuals who failed to obtain insurance coverage, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage, which changes to the ACA’s minimum coverage requirements may lead to policies with less generous benefits. While the timing and scope of any potential future legislation to repeal and replace ACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, it is also possible that some of the ACA provisions that generally are not favorable for the research-based pharmaceutical industry could also be repealed along with ACA coverage expansion provisions.
