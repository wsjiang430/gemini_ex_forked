Webster Bank also has various other subsidiaries that are not significant to the consolidated group.
Competition
Webster is subject to strong competition from banks, thrifts, credit unions, non-bank health savings account trustees, consumer finance companies, investment companies, insurance companies, and online lending and savings institutions. Certain of these competitors are larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources, lending limits, larger branch systems, and a wider array of commercial and consumer banking services than Webster. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-bank entities, greater technological developments in the industry, and continued bank regulatory reforms.
Webster faces substantial competition for deposits and loans throughout its market areas. The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates, personalized services, the quality and range of financial services, convenience of office locations and hours, mobile banking and other automated services. Competition for deposits comes from other commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, non-bank health savings account trustees, mutual funds, and other investment alternatives. The primary factors in competing for consumer and commercial loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, ease and convenience of loan origination channels, the quality and range of lending services, personalized service and ability to close within customers' desired time frame. Competition for origination of loans comes primarily from commercial banks, non-bank lenders, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, mortgage brokers, online lenders, and insurance companies. Other factors which affect competition include the general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels, and volatility in the lending markets.
Supervision and Regulation 
Webster and its bank and non-bank subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies. Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to Webster and its bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations, and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to Webster and its bank and non-bank subsidiaries could have a material effect on the results of the Company.
Webster Financial Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from Webster Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a registered bank holding company and a financial holding company it is subject to inspection, examination, and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and is regulated under the BHC Act. Webster is under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Webster is subject to the rules for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) supervises Webster for compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. Webster also is subject to oversight by state attorneys general for compliance with state consumer protection laws. Webster's non-bank subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations of the Federal Reserve System.
Webster Bank is organized as a national banking association under the National Bank Act. Webster Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as its primary federal regulator, as well as by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as its deposit insurer. Webster Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with FDIC laws and regulations. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the United States. Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight. Several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking, guidance, and interpretation by the federal banking agencies. The current administration and its appointees to the federal banking agencies have expressed interest in reviewing, revising, and perhaps repealing portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain of its implementing regulations.
On May 14, 2018, the President signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which among other things, amended certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as statutes administered by the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and the OCC. The amendments made by the EGRRCPA provide limited regulatory relief for certain financial institutions and additional tailoring of banking and consumer protection laws, while preserving the existing framework under which U.S. financial institutions are regulated, including the discretionary authority of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and the OCC to supervise bank holding companies and insured depository institutions, such as Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank.
In addition, EGRRCPA includes certain other banking-related consumer protection as securities law-related provisions. Many of the EGRRCPA changes must be implemented through rules adopted by the federal banking regulators and certain changes remain subject to substantial regulatory discretion of the federal banking regulators. As a result, the full impact of EGRRCPA will remain unclear for the immediate future. The Company expects to continue to evaluate the potential impact of EGRRCPA as it is further implemented by the regulators.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
Webster Financial Corporation is a bank holding company as defined under the BHC Act. The BHC Act generally limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that have elected to become financial holding companies, such as Webster Financial Corporation, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system (as solely determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting, and making merchant banking investments.
Mergers and Acquisitions
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions. The BHC Act requires the prior Federal Reserve System approval for a bank holding company to acquire, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company, other than a bank holding company, to acquire 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company.  Under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person, including a company, may not acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a bank without providing 60 days prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency.  
Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions.  In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger or purchase and assumption transactions, the federal banking agencies will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined banks, the applicant's performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), and the effectiveness of the merging banks in combating money laundering.
Enhanced Prudential Standards
Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes enhanced prudential standards on larger banking organizations. However, as of the enactment of EGRRCPA on May 24, 2018, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in assets, such as Webster Financial Corporation are exempt from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under Section 165. As a result Webster Financial Corporation is relieved from the requirement to conduct company-run stress testing for itself and Webster Bank. However, while the federal banking agencies will not require company-run stress testing, the capital planning and risk management practices of the Company will continue to be reviewed through regular supervisory processes of the Federal Reserve System and the OCC. The Company will continue to perform certain stress tests internally and incorporate the economic models and information developed through its stress testing program into its risk management and business planning activities.
Furthermore, under a previously issued rule of the Federal Reserve System implementing enhanced prudential standards required by the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets were subject to certain rules, including a requirement to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors to manage enterprise-wide risk. EGRRCPA subsequently increased the asset threshold for requiring a bank holding company to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors from $10 billion to $50 billion. Notwithstanding the changes implemented by EGRRCPA, the Company anticipates retaining its Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
Debit Card Interchange Fees
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction, with regulations that establish such fee standards, eliminate exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions, and limit restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. Under the Federal Reserve System's approved final debit card interchange rule pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, an issuer's base fee is capped at 21 cents per transaction and allows for an additional amount equal to 5 basis points of the transaction's value. The Federal Reserve System separately issued a final rule that also allows a fraud-prevention adjustment of 1 cent per transaction conditioned upon an issuer developing, implementing, and updating reasonably designed fraud-prevention policies and procedures. 
Identity Theft
The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jointly issued final rules and guidelines implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft. The rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy these requirements. In addition, the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC or the CFTC, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances. Webster implemented an ID Theft Prevention Program, approved by its Board of Directors, in compliance with these requirements.
Volcker Rule
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as Webster and Webster Bank, from: (i) engaging in proprietary trading and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Volcker Rule, the term covered funds is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the exemption in section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, which includes collateralized loan obligation securities (CLO) and collateralized debt obligation securities. There are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund, including, among other things, loan securitizations, joint ventures, certain types of foreign funds, entities issuing asset-backed commercial paper, and registered investment companies. The Federal Reserve approved Webster's illiquid funds extension request, thereby providing Webster with up to five additional years, to July 21, 2022, to bring such holdings into compliance with the Volcker Rule.
Dividends
The principal source of liquidity for the Holding Company is dividends from Webster Bank. Prior approval of the OCC would be required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in a year would exceed the sum of its net income for that year and its undistributed net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits a national bank from paying dividends that would be greater than its undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). Webster Bank paid the Holding Company $290.0 million in dividends during the year ended December 31, 2018 and had $341.8 million of undistributed net income available for payment of dividends at December 31, 2018.
In addition, Webster Financial Corporation and Webster Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. Federal regulatory agencies are authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company, or a bank, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
Federal Reserve System
Federal Reserve System regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily interest-bearing and regular checking accounts. The required cash reserves can be in the form of vault cash and, if vault cash does not fully satisfy the required cash reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with Federal Reserve Banks. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System generally makes annual adjustments to the tiered cash reserve requirements. The regulations require that Webster maintain cash reserves against aggregate transaction accounts in excess of the exempt amount of $16.0 million at December 31, 2018. Effective January 17, 2019, amounts greater than $16.3 million up to and including $124.2 million have a reserve requirement of 3% and amounts in excess of $124.2 million have a reserve requirement of 10%. Webster Bank is in compliance with these cash reserve requirements.
As a national bank and member of the Federal Reserve System, Webster Bank is required to hold capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of Boston. The required shares may be adjusted up or down based on changes to Webster Bank's common stock and paid-in surplus. Webster Bank was in compliance with these requirements, with a total investment in FRB of Boston stock of $50.7 million at December 31, 2018. The FRBs pay a semi-annual dividend, to member banks with total assets greater than $10 billion, equal to the lesser of 6% or the yield on the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction prior to the dividend payment date. For the semi-annual period ended December 31, 2018, the FRB of Boston declared a cash dividend equal to an annual yield of 2.92%.
Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. Webster Bank is a member of the FHLB of Boston. Webster Bank (the Bank) is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB for both membership and activity-based purposes. The capital stock requirement includes an amount equal to 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Bank's unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, up to a maximum of $25 million, plus an amount that varies from 3.0% to 4.5% depending on the maturities of its FHLB advances, which totaled approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Webster Bank was in compliance with these requirements, with a total investment in FHLB stock of $98.6 million at December 31, 2018. On November 2, 2018, the FHLB paid a quarterly cash dividend equal to an annual yield of 5.87%.
Source of Strength Doctrine
Federal Reserve System policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength. As a result, Webster Financial Corporation is expected to commit resources to support Webster Bank, including at times when Webster Financial Corporation may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. The U.S. bankruptcy code provides that, in the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. In addition, under the National Bank Act, if the capital stock of Webster Bank is impaired by losses, or otherwise, the OCC is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the Holding Company. If the assessment is not paid within three months, the OCC could order a sale of the Webster Bank stock held by Webster Financial Corporation to cover any deficiency.
Capital Adequacy 
The final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (Capital Rules) under a global regulatory framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BASEL III) adopted by the Federal Reserve System, the OCC, and the FDIC generally implement the capital framework for strengthening international capital standards. The Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios.
The Capital Rules: (i) include the capital measure Common Equity Tier 1, defined by Basel III capital rules (CET1 capital) and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 capital and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.
Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including Webster, the most common form of additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and the qualifying portion of ALLL, in each case, subject to specific requirements of the Capital Rules. Tier 1 capital to adjusted, as defined, average consolidated assets is known as the Tier 1 leverage ratio.
Pursuant to the Capital Rules, ratio thresholds are as follows:

 | Adequately Capitalized | | Well Capitalized
CET1 risk-based capital | 4.5 | % | | 6.5 | %
Total risk-based capital | 8.0 | | | 10.0 | 
Tier 1 risk-based capital | 6.0 | | | 8.0 | 
Tier 1 leverage capital | 4.0 | | | 5.0 | 

The Capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1 capital, in addition to the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid limitations on distributions, such as dividends; equity; other capital instrument repurchases; and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall. The Capital Rules became fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Thus, the capital standards applicable to Webster and Webster Bank beginning in 2019, include an additional capital conservation buffer for which the lowest capital ratio excess over adequately capitalized must be at least 2.5%.
The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1 capital. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets (DTAs), and significant investments in non-consolidated financial institutions be deducted from CET1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 capital or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1 capital.
Under the Basel III Rule, certain off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are converted into risk-weighted assets, that together with on-balance sheet assets, are the base against which regulatory capital is measured. The risk-weighting categories are standardized for bank holding companies and banks based on a risk-sensitive analysis, depending on the nature of the exposure. Risk weights range from 0% for U.S. government securities to 1,250% for exposures such as certain tranches of securitizations or certain equity exposures. 
Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness 
Pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should an insured depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the under capitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or under capitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 
Prompt corrective action ratios are as follows:

 | Well | | Adequately | | Under | Significantly 
 | Capitalized | | Capitalized | | Capitalized | Under-Capitalized
CET1 risk-based capital | 6.5 | % | | 4.5 | % | < 4.5% | < 3.0%
Total risk-based capital | 10.0 | | | 8.0 | | < 8.0% | < 6.0%
Tier 1 risk-based capital | 8.0 | | | 6.0 | | < 6.0% | < 4.0%
Tier 1 leverage capital | 5.0 | | | 4.0 | | < 4.0% | < 3.0%

An insured depository institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than 2% is considered critically under-capitalized.
Bank holding companies and insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution affiliated parties; the termination of the insured depository institution’s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the insured depository institution; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the FDIC, as receiver, would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
Under federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) and Federal Reserve Regulation W. In a bank holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company, are affiliates of the bank. Generally, sections 23A and 23B of the FRA are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate, and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA and its implementing Regulation O restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders or insiders. Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution's total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h) of the FRA, loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank's employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers.
Consumer Protection and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision
The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Practices Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, which is part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or operations.
The ability-to-repay provision of the Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to make reasonable, good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable third-party documents. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the qualified mortgage provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, commonly known as the qualified mortgage (QM) Rule, loans meeting the definition of qualified mortgage are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. The presumption is a conclusive presumption/safe harbor for prime loans meeting QM requirements and a refutable presumption for higher-priced/subprime loans meeting QM requirements. The QM definition incorporates the statutory requirements, such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than 30 years. The QM Rule also adds an explicit maximum 43% debt-to-income ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the QM definition, though some mortgages that meet GSE, FHA, and VA underwriting guidelines may, for a period not to exceed seven years, meet the QM definition without being subject to the 43% debt-to-income limits. The CFPB is expected to continue to issue and amend rules implementing the consumer financial protection laws, which may impact Webster Bank's operations.
Financial Privacy and Data Security
Webster is subject to federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from non-affiliated financial institutions. These provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt-out or opt-in authorizations. 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third-parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity plannning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution's operations after a cyber attack. Further, pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their non-public personal information.
Depositor Preference
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Federal Deposit Insurance
The FDIC’s deposit insurance limit is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. Substantially all of the deposits of Webster Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.
The Bank’s quarterly assessment is calculated using the FDIC’s standardized risk-based assessment methodology, determined by the FDIC, which multiplies the Bank's assessment base by its assessment rate. The assessment base is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the Bank. The assessment rate is based on measures of the institution’s capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk (CAMELS) ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress, and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the Bank’s failure. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the base assessment rate to reflect idiosyncratic quantitative and qualitative risk factors not captured in the FDIC’s standardized risk-based assessment methodology.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Webster's management is not aware of any practice, condition, or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance.
Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including Webster and Webster Bank, with at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called "golden parachute" payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. At Webster's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, its shareholders voted on a non-binding, advisory basis to hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers of Webster annually. As a result of the vote, the Board of Directors determined to hold the vote annually.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws
Webster Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by OCC regulations to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The OCC examines Webster Bank's record of compliance with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. Webster Bank's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of Webster Financial Corporation. Webster Bank's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions against it by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Department of Justice. Webster Bank's latest OCC CRA rating was Outstanding.
USA PATRIOT Act
Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns, and are prohibited from dealing with foreign "shell banks" and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. Webster has in place a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act compliance program and engages in very few transactions of any kind with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the "OFAC" rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Office of Foreign Assets Control-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Future Legislative Initiatives
Federal and state legislatures may introduce legislation that will impact the financial services industry. In addition, federal banking agencies may introduce regulatory initiatives that are likely to impact the financial services industry, generally. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and/or depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to Webster or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
Risk Management Framework 
Webster takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined enterprise risk management framework which provides a structured approach for identifying, assessing and managing risks across the Company in a coordinated manner, including strategic and reputational, credit, information security and technology, operational and compliance, market, liquidity, and capital risks as discussed in detail in the sections below.
Strategic and Reputational Risks
The enterprise risk management framework enables the aggregation of risk across the enterprise and ensures the Company has the tools, programs, and processes in place to support informed decision making in order to anticipate risks before they materialize and to maintain Webster's risk profile consistent with its risk strategy and appetite.
The enterprise risk management framework includes an articulated risk appetite statement approved annually by the Board of Directors. The risk appetite statement is supported by board and business level scorecards with defined risk tolerance limits to ensure that Webster maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures that indicate the level of risk that the Company is willing to accept. The risk appetite is refreshed annually in conjunction with the strategic plan to align risk appetite with Webster's strategy and financial plan.
Webster promotes proactive risk management by all Webster employees and clear ownership and accountability across three lines of defense to enable an effective and credible challenge in line with Webster's strong risk culture. Employees in each line of business serve as the first line of defense and have responsibility for identifying, managing and owning the risks in their businesses. Risk and enterprise support functions, for example third party risk management and legal departments, serve as the second line of defense and are responsible for providing guidance, oversight and challenge to the first line of defense. Internal Audit and Credit Risk Review, both of which are independent of management, serve as the third line of defense and ensure, through review and testing, that appropriate risk management controls, processes and systems are in place and functioning effectively.
The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, comprised of independent directors, oversees all of Webster's risk-related matters and provides input and guidance to the Board of Directors and the executive team, as appropriate. Webster's Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), which reports directly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and is comprised of Webster's executive management and senior risk officers.
The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining Webster's enterprise risk management framework and overseeing credit risk, operational and compliance risk, Bank Secrecy Act compliance and loan workout/recovery programs. The Corporate Treasurer, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for overseeing market, liquidity, and capital risk management activities. The Chief Information Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for overseeing information security and technology risk management activities.
Credit Risk
Webster manages and controls credit risk in its loan and investment portfolios through established underwriting practices, adherence to standards, and utilization of various portfolio and transaction monitoring tools and processes. Credit policies and underwriting guidelines provide limits on exposure and establish various other standards as deemed necessary and prudent. Additional approval requirements and reporting are implemented to ensure proper risk identification, decision rationale, risk ratings, and disclosure of policy exceptions.
Credit risk management policies and transaction approvals are managed under the supervision of the Chief Credit Officer who reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer and team of credit executives are independent of the loan production and treasury areas. The credit risk function oversees the underwriting, approval and portfolio management process, establishes and ensures adherence to credit policies, and manages the collections and problem asset resolution activities.
As part of credit risk management governance, Webster has an established Credit Risk Management Committee that meets regularly to review key credit risk topics, issues, and policies. The Credit Risk Management Committee reviews Webster's credit risk scorecard, which covers key risk indicators and limits established as part of the Company's risk appetite framework. The Credit Risk Management Committee is chaired by the Chief Credit Officer and includes senior managers responsible for lending as well as senior managers from the credit risk management function. Important findings regarding credit quality and trends within the loan and investment portfolios are regularly reported by the Chief Credit Officer to the ERMC and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
In addition to the credit risk management team, there is an independent Credit Risk Review function that assesses risk ratings and credit underwriting process for all areas of the organization that incur credit risk. The head of Credit Risk Review reports directly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and administratively to the Chief Risk Officer. Credit Risk Review findings are reported to the Credit Risk Management Committee, ERMC and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Corrective measures are monitored and tested to ensure risk issues are mitigated or resolved.
Information Security and Technology Risks
The use of technology to store and process information and an increasing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions continues to expose Webster to the risk of potential operational disruption, or information security incidents. Sources of these risks include deliberate or accidental acts by employees, external parties, technology failure, third-party security practices, and environmental factors. Webster is committed to preventing, detecting, and responding to incidents that may impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets and has established a comprehensive information security and technology framework, with policies, procedures, processes, systems, and oversight by the Information Security Oversight Committee. The Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of Webster's information security framework and serves as the Chair of the Information Security Oversight Committee.
Operational and Compliance Risks
Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The Operational Risk function is responsible for establishing processes and tools to identify, manage, and aggregate operational risk across the organization; providing guidance and advice on operational risk matters; and educating the organization on operational risks. Compliance risk represents the risk of non-adherence to applicable laws and regulations, including fines penalties and reputation damage. Specific programs and functions have been implemented to manage the risks associated with legal and regulatory requirements, suppliers and other third-parties, information security, business disruption, fraud, analytical and forecasting models, and new products and services.
Webster's Operational Risk Management Committee, which consists of senior risk officers and senior managers responsible for operational and compliance risk management across the Company, periodically reviews the aforementioned programs, as well as key operational risk trends, issues, and mitigation activities. The Director of Enterprise and Operational Risk Management chairs the Operational Risk Management Committee and is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of Webster's operational risk management framework.
Market Risk
Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates and prices, such as equity prices. The risk of loss is assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows, and future earnings. Due to the nature of its operations, Webster is primarily exposed to interest rate risk. Webster's interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by its Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO). The primary goal of ALCO is to manage interest rate risk to maximize earnings and net economic value in changing interest rate and business environments, subject to Board approved risk limits. ALCO is chaired by Webster's Corporate Treasurer and members include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. ALCO activities and findings are regularly reported to the ERMC and the Board of Directors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk refers to the ability to meet a demand for funds by converting assets into cash or cash equivalents and by increasing liabilities at an acceptable cost. Liquidity management for Webster Bank involves maintaining the ability to meet day-to-day and longer-term cash flow requirements of customers, whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs. Sources of funds include deposits, borrowings, or sales of assets such as unencumbered investment securities.
The Holding Company requires funds for dividends to shareholders, payment of debt obligations, repurchase of shares, potential acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes. Its sources of funds include dividends from Webster Bank, income from investment securities, and the issuance of equity and debt in the capital markets.
Both the Holding Company and Webster Bank maintain a level of liquidity necessary to achieve their business objectives under both normal and stressed conditions. Liquidity risk is monitored and managed by ALCO and reviewed regularly with the ERMC and the Board of Directors.
Capital Risk
Webster aims to maintain adequate capital in both normal and stressed environments to support its business objectives and risk appetite. ALCO monitors regulatory and tangible capital levels according to regulatory requirements and management operating ranges and recommends capital conservation, generation, and/or deployment strategies. ALCO also has responsibility for the annual capital plan, capital ratio range setting, contingency planning and stress testing, which are all reviewed and approved by the ERMC and the Board of Directors, at least annually.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit provides independent, objective assurance and advisory services by applying a risk-based approach to selectively test and evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of applicable internal controls throughout the Company. This evaluation function brings a systematic and disciplined approach to enhancing the effectiveness of the Company's governance, risk management, and internal control processes.
Results of Internal Audit reviews are reported to management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Corrective measures are monitored to ensure risk issues are mitigated or resolved. The General Auditor reports functionally to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Executive Officer. The appointment or replacement of the General Auditor is overseen by the Audit Committee.
Additional information on risks and uncertainties and additional factors that could affect the Company's results of operations can be found in Item 1A and elsewhere within this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and in other reports Webster Financial Corporation files with the SEC.
