Item 1. Description of Business
Our Company

Allied Corp. (“Allied”) is an international company with a mission to address medical issues by researching, creating and producing targeted cannabinoid health solutions including CBD, cannabis, and psilocybin-based products. Through the efforts of its Officers, Directors, and strategic partners over the past two decades, we have developed a variety of cannabinoid and psilocybin solutions for health and wellness applications, with an initial focus on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, General Depression and Anxiety. We use what we consider to be an evidence-informed scientific approach to undertake its mission, through pharmaceutical research and development, plant-based production and development of unique therapeutic products.

We are targeting the cannabis and psilocybin markets, which are growing at 50% per year and projected to reach $20 billion of global revenues by 2024, according to BDS Analytics. We believe we have an opportunity to diversify revenue streams across consumer segments of the CBD, cannabis, and psilocybin product markets, including wellness, beauty, as well as food and beverages.

Historical Company Information

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 3, 2013 under the name “Cosmo Ventures, Inc.” On July 1, 2019 the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with Nevada changing the name to Allied Corp.

Effective July 25, 2019 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase and Reorganization Agreement with AM (Advanced Micro) Biosciences, Inc., a British Columbia Canada corporation. Upon completion of the closing effective September 10, 2019, AM (Advanced Micro) Biosciences became a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Company.

References in this Offering Circular to “Allied” or the “Company” may include references to the operations of our subsidiaries AM (Advanced Micro) Biosciences, Inc., Allied Corp Colombia S.A.S., Pacific Sun Fungi Inc., Allied US Products, LLC and Tactical Relief, LLC. All of these entities are 100% wholly owned subsidiaries of Allied. 

The Company’s principal corporate office is located at 1405 St. Paul St., Suite 201, Kelowna, BC Canada V1Y 9N2. Our telephone number is (877) 255-4337. Our email is ir@allied.health. 

Our Opportunity

We focus on the development of medicinal cannabis and psilocybin products for patients with conditions potentially suitable for treatment therewith. Such conditions include anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, chronic pain, epilepsy, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Parkinson’s disease, Tourette syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI)1.

Our objective is to be a company that controls its own international vertically integrated supply chain or CBD, cannabis, and psilocybin products in order to maximize cash flow and profit margins. Our management team believes that having control over our supply chain should enable us to provide a consistent, rolling-harvest supply to the global cannabis community. 

Given the average cost of production in North America being approximately $1.00 to $2.00 per gram, we believe our anticipated raw flower cash cost of $0.05 per gram based on historical production of ours and other companies in the same region of cannabis production afforded by our Colombian production and cultivation should provide us a competitive advantage.


4


In addition to what we consider our demonstrated ability to cultivate low-cost, high margin cannabis in Colombia primarily for use in proprietary cannabinoid drug and natural health products for international distribution, we have hemp derived CBD natural health products for sale in the United States, have received commercial approval for exports of medical cannabis being produced in Colombia for export and have initiated human clinical phase I trial for our psilocybin-based pharma products ALID 11, ALID 12 and Psilonex™ which are protected under provisional patent and trademarks in the United States. 

We intend for our clients to access superior cannabis-related products developed with a high level of quality control. The Company believes that is fortunate to have assembled a team of industry veterans and management professionals with the background and experience to enable the Company to build, manage and grow such systems.

Key Strategic Objectives 

Scale cannabis production in Colombia

We believe our Bucaramanga, Colombia development and cultivation facility gives us a significant competitive advantage in our production and sales of cannabis:


● | We are licensed to produce, extract, as well as both import and export psychoactive and non-psychoactive strains of cannabis. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We were approved to export cannabis by the Colombian government in April 2021. 
● | We have constructed a one-hectare greenhouse, with another ten to twenty hectares more planned for 2023. 
● | We are now deriving monthly revenue from our Colombian cannabis harvests. 
● | We completed our first harvest in July 2020 for the Colombian Ministry of Agriculture (“ICA”). 
● | We obtained commercial approval for production of non-psychoactive cannabis in October 2020, and commercial approval for production of psychoactive cannabis in February 2021. 
● | Each of our ten non-psychoactive CBD seed strains, and our ten THC seed strains submitted to ICA have been approved over a course of a process that began in October 2019. 
● | We shipped 1,728 kilograms of Colombia-grown cannabis to Switzerland in August 2022. 
● | In September 2022 we harvested our first psychoactive THC harvest of 2,200 plants. In October 23 harvested an additional 6,100 plants. These have been dried and cured and will be tested before being offered to sale and export. The production pipeline has additional work packages of approximately 6,000 plants every two to three weeks. We only sell and ship Colombia produced cannabis flower to countries where it is legal to do so. 
● | Lower production cost: Our anticipated cash cost of raw flower production is approximately $0.05 per gram based on historical production of ours and other companies based in the same region, as favorably compared to the North American production costs of as opposed to most production between $1.00 and $2.00 per gram that we have observed. 


5


● | Access to scalable land holdings in what we consider to be one of Colombia’s best suited climates for cannabis production in the order of 200 acres. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have all Colombian commercial production approvals and has applied for psychoactive quota for the equivalent of 10,000 kgs of psychoactive flower for 2021 and 85,000 kgs of flower production in 2022. Non psychoactive production and sales are limitless under current Colombian law.
● | We have engaged what we consider to be one of Colombia’s leading agricultural genetics teams for cannabis production. 


Since we received cultivation approval from ICA, we have developed what we consider to be competitive advantages of Yield, Cannabinoid Potency, Quality, Cost, Frequency of Harvests, and, notably have:


● | Yield-Continually increased our yields per hectare. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Potency-Increased and replicated the THC and CBD yields of our plant/seed strains. 
● | Cost-Reduced our cash cost of raw flower production to as little as $0.05 per gram based on historical production of ours and other companies in the same region. 
● | Quality-Met or Exceeded European Pharmacopeia Standards. 
● | Frequency of Harvest-We currently harvest six to seven times per year in order maximize our production footprint. Consequently, each hectare at our Colombian cultivation site is expected to produce the equivalent of six to seven hectares of cannabis on a mono-crop yearly cycle. (See-Cannabis Production-Colombia).

Establish United States Production of Cannabis if Federally legalized

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Allied US Products LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, entered into a contingent asset purchase agreement (the “ Contingent Asset Purchase Agreement”) which allows for the purchase of a Nevada State US-based cannabis license from a subsidiary of Fiore Cannabis, Ltd. upon on the occurrence or waiver of the changes in U.S. federal law to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (the “Triggering Event”). We will only conduct business activities related to growing or processing cannabis in jurisdictions, including the United States, when it is federally permissible to do so. While we have several arrangements with United States based companies that may themselves participate in the United States cannabis market, these relationships do not violate the federal laws of the United States respecting cannabis and in no manner involve us in any activities in the United States respecting cannabis. (See- Potential United States Production in the Event of Federal Cannabis Legalization).

Generate Revenues from Natural Health Products containing Hemp-based CBD.

With the launch of our health hemp-based CBD brands in the United States, we expect from product rollout and expanded distribution. We have conducted focus groups, brand creation and test marketing over the past year. We have now commercially launched three brands in the US: Tactical Relief™, Equilibrium Bio™, MaXXa ©. The Buds Pure Naturals brand is intended to be licensed to a Canadian License holder to sell into the Canadian market. (See-Our CBD Brands and Products).

Complete trials of ALID 11, 11 and Psilonex™ Prescription Medications

We completed our clinical Phase 1 pharma trials in 2021, eventually leading to a drug indication for PTSD. We plan to pursue a licensing deal with a larger developer, producer, and distributor of pharmaceuticals. (See-Pharmacologic Products).

Distribution

Our goal is to become a market leader in the cultivation and processing of medicinal-grade cannabis oil and high quality cannabis derived medical and well-being products for large channel distributors, including pharmacies, medical clinics, and cosmetic companies, by expanding our production capacity, creating sustainable and natural products, expanding our geographic footprint, continuing to explore strategic partnerships and pursuing accretive acquisitions to supplement our organic growth as set forth below.

6


Explore strategic partnerships.

Because we offer a variety of cannabis related products, including beauty and skincare products, foods and beverages, we believe that we can create a competitive advantage by partnering with national and multinational companies, across various product categories to jointly develop and market branded cannabis offerings.

Pursue accretive acquisitions.

We believe that our deal-making capabilities and experience will allow us to successfully identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions. The cannabis industry is highly fragmented and as it continues to evolve, we expect significant industry consolidation in existing and new markets. Our deal-making capabilities and experience may allow us to successfully identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions. As a public company, we could have greater ability to finance acquisitions, including through using our equity as consideration and accessing the capital markets.

Due to the competitive and dynamic nature of the emerging cannabis products market and rapid changes in the regulatory environment, we recognize the need to remain flexible, so we can react to opportunities and risks as they develop. We will continue to re-evaluate and re-prioritize our strategies to respond to these developments. We are actively fostering a culture of continued agility and exploration since the ability to pivot depending on market dynamics will deliver competitive advantage.

Our CBD Brands and Products

Over the past year we have developed, manufactured and test marketed all of our hemp derived CBD products for sale in the United States. Under the Farm Bill of December 2018, the use and sale of hemp derived CBD products in the United States is legal.

We have three hemp derived CBD product brands to market in the United States all with a catalog of products. We are selling these through e-commerce portal at www.alliedcorpbrands.com, and is also actively seeking physical retail store distribution throughout many states.

Pharmacologic Products

Allied was organized because our founders believed veterans and first responders suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) could have their underlying symptoms better addressed with targeted cannabinoid pharmacologic solutions. We entered into an agreement to purchase all common shares of Pacific Sun Fungi Inc. on January 24, 2021 which was subsequently amended and the acquisition later closed in March 2021. The primary business plan for acquiring Pacific Sun Fungi Inc. is to develop psilocybin-based solutions, including both potential pharmaceutical and natural health products, for those suffering from PTSD. Accordingly, we have expanded our pharmacologic research to find better treatment options for those suffering from depression, anxiety and general mental health issues. Accordingly, we believe we are in a unique position to develop a full-scope, closed-loop therapy protocol, which contrasts with psilocybin therapies that support the patient for an episodic micro-dosing treatment regime following a specific dosing and wash out cycle. We believe our existing cannabinoid treatment solutions may alleviate the effects of the “treatment gaps” between psilocybin dosing periods, providing what we call the “Allied Full Scope Treatment”.

9


Our proprietary “Allied Full Scope Treatment” offers the patient continual therapy with treatment options both before and after the psilocybin treatment period. This is accomplished by offering our cannabinoid and natural health products combined with the psilocybin products and protocols under legally mandated licenses with physician supervision.

We are also in the process of applying for a Section 56 exemption in Canada for physicians to be able to prescribe our formulations to military veterans and first responders. Our objective is to be one of the first companies to come to market with a PTSD treatment regimen of internally-developed proprietary psilocybin products augmented by our natural health and cannabis-derived pharmacologic products.

Products in Development

Psilonex™

On March 25, 2021 we announced that we filed for trademark protection with the United States Patent Office for our pharmaceutical product Psilonex™. Psilonex™ is a proprietary formulation prescribed within a treatment path that involves both a pharmaceutical psilocybin-based formulation, followed by a daily cannabinoid maintenance period. Psilonex™ is intended to be prescribed by a physician, followed by the cannabinoid daily therapy that can be purchased by the consumer in regions where it is legal to do so as “Psilonex™ Daily,” Both of these products are currently being researched, developed and tested by our pharmaceutical development team.

The filed trademark protects our intellectual property for Psilonex™ covering: chemical preparations for pharmaceutical or medical purposes, namely, for treating depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and for improving mental health; nutraceuticals for the treatment of mental health disorders and conditions, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD; nutraceuticals for use as a dietary supplement; Nutraceuticals for use as a dietary supplement for improving mental health; pharmaceutical preparations and substances for the treatment of psychiatric diseases and disorders; pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment and prevention of mental health disorders; Pharmaceuticals, namely, psychotropics; dietary and nutritional supplements; fungal extracts sold as a component ingredient of nutritional supplements and vitamins, and; related websites.

ALID 10 and ALID 11

ALID 10 and ALID 11 target the treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and related mental health conditions through the targeted function of the 5-HT2 receptor and physiological pathways. Following the completion of the pre-clinical research phase, we intend to bring ALID 10 and ALID 11 through human clinical trials through its relationships with the University of Haifa, Israel and MGC Pharma in Europe. 

In 2020, we filed a United States provisional patent application entitled “Compositions and Methods for Modulating Endocannabinoid Systems Activity and Treating Mental Health Disorders”. The patent application covers ALID-10 and ALID-11, as well as other cannabis derived compounds designed for superior pharmaceutical properties for treatment of PTSD and other mental disorders.

In October 2019, we signed a Master Services Agreement with the University of Haifa, Israel. This academic research center gives us access to a proprietary pre-clinical animal model that is owned by Carmel. Carmel is the business unit that manages the University of Haifa center for Research in Israel. Specifically, we will use this proprietary animal model for the purposes of specialized pharmaceutical cannabinoid research and pharmaceutical product development. Through our agreement, we have access to the University of Haifa’s leading-edge facilities, proprietary animal model, pharmaceutical development, academic laboratory and associated scientists and investigators. This should enable us to conduct the pre-clinical phase of the development of a proprietary pharmaceutical product for ALID-10 and ALID-11. 


10


In the second quarter of 2020, we expanded our ALID-10 and ALID-11 research activities, as well as entered into a manufacturing and sales agreement with MGC Pharmaceuticals of Australia (“MGC”). Under the terms of these agreements, MGC will manufacture our pharmaceutical products within their GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified factory in Slovenia (which is in the European Union, or EU), which should enable us to have our pharmacological products produced under procedures and methods that meet those high-quality standards. In addition, the MGC sales and distribution agreement, should provide us a channel to sell our products following the completion of a PHASE I clinical trial. MGC currently has cannabis-based pharmaceutical products for sale in Europe, and. Moreover, we believe it has demonstrated a proven ability to commercialize cannabis based pharmaceutical products. We also announced the initiation of a pharmaceutical human clinical PHASE I research trial with MGC, but COVID-19 had an operational impact on the progression of this research trial. We intend to complete this trial as a part of the use of proceeds from this financing. 

Under the terms of our agreements with MGC, it will provide what we consider to be a comprehensive suite of pharmaceutical services to advance our pharmaceutical products into human clinical PHASE 1. This trial is expected to test the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of our pipeline of proprietary cannabis derived drug candidates targeting PTSD. The scope of MGC Pharma’s services are to cover clinical research, Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) registration, manufacturing of lab volumes for the research project, drug stability testing, GMP manufacturing and regulatory assistance for obtaining an IMP numbers that are needed in order for pharmaceutical products to be sold.

Psilocybin Development

Recent Regulatory Developments Suggest Increased Acceptance of Pharmacologic Psilocybin


● | In 2018, the FDA recognized psilocybin therapies as a “breakthrough” therapy for PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. (Food and Drug Administration, 2018). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In 2019, Imperial College of London and John Hopkins open the first psychedelic research centers. MAPS clinics across the nation conduct research on psilocybin therapy. (Forbes.com, 2019). 
● | In 2020, Health Canada approves psilocybin for use with select patients with terminal illnesses, while the State of Oregon decriminalized psilocybin. (Health Canada, 2020 and Oregon State Health, 2020).

Our Psilocybin Patent Applications

On October 20, 2020 we filed a new United States provisional patent application entitled “PSILOCYBIN COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS AND THEIR USE IN TREATING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH”. The provisional patent application covers a novel combination of psilocybin and proprietary mushroom formulation, as well as a novel treatment regimen targeting Post Traumatic Stress (PTSD), Depression and General Anxiety. Along with the novel treatment regimen, our formulation consists of novel micro-dose ratios of several medical mushroom compounds combined with additional natural health molecules.

Along with the proprietary functional mushroom formulation under provisional patent, a full scope treatment regime involving our specific CBD and terpene products is ready to add to the patent. This is the first full scope treatment of its kind that involves a specific psilocybin treatment regime that is bridged with a cannabinoid therapy approach. A full scope psilocybin and cannabinoid treatment approach to mental health.

In March 2021, we submitted a second provisional patent for our therapeutic formulation and treatment regimen involving a prescription drug followed by a prophylactic daily drug formulation. These two products together administered under a novel treatment regimen are intended to be tested through our clinical trial infrastructure in pursuit of a drug indication for general depression and anxiety.


11

The provisional patent submitted is entitled: COMPOSITIONS AND FORMULATIONS OF PSILOCYBIN AND CANNABINOIDS AND METHODS OF THEIR USE TOGETHER FOR TREATING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH.

This provisional patent contemplates the full scope treatment of general depression and anxiety with a proprietary prescription medication followed by a daily prophylactic dose of proprietary medicinal compositions. This includes a proprietary dosing and therapeutic regimen of psilocybin, additional functional mushrooms and cannabinoid therapeutics.

Among the various aspects of the present invention contemplated in the provisional patent submission are compositions, formulations, methods for modulating endocannabinoid system activity, for modulating neuro-steroid biosynthesis, and for modulating neurotransmission, and methods for treating mental health disorders and improving mental health, using synergistic combinations of psilocybin, cannabinoids, and other active agents, provided in distinct daily dosing regimens.

Pacific Sun Fungi

In March 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pacific Sun Fungi which is now a 100% wholly owned subsidiary. This acquisition further expands upon our provisional patent submissions for our functional mushroom formulation targeting major depression and anxiety. Pacific Sun performs psilocybin research and development, and holds several formulations that have been tested under physician supervision. In addition, Pacific Sun also has proprietary extraction knowledge and proprietary formulations for several specific disease targets and physician-led therapy protocols. We are in testing these products rigorously through the appropriate research protocols to determine their efficacy as treatments for specific disease targets.

We believe Pacific Sun has many products some of which have provisional patents or patent applications ready for clinical intake consisting of both novel functional mushroom formulations including psilocybin and additional medical mushrooms. We will be research, and intend to bring to market, a 100mg psilocybin formulation, a 250mg formulation, as well as other novel dosing technologies.

Cannabis Production

Colombia

We believe our Bucaramanga, Colombia development and cultivation facility gives us a significant competitive advantage in our production and sales of cannabis:


● | We are licensed to produce, extract, as well as both import and export psychoactive and non-psychoactive strains of cannabis. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We were approved to export cannabis by the Colombian government in April 2021. 
● | We have constructed a one-hectare greenhouse, with another three to five additional hectares are anticipated in 2021, and ten to twenty hectares more planned for 2022. 
● | We completed our first harvest in July 2020 as part of the approval process for the Colombian Ministry of Agriculture (“ICA”). 
● | We obtained commercial approval for production of non-psychoactive cannabis in October 2020, and commercial approval for production of psychoactive cannabis in February 2021. 
● | Each of our ten non-psychoactive CBD seed strains, and our ten THC seed strains submitted to ICA have been approved over a course of a process that began in October 2019. 
● | Lower production cost: Our anticipated cash cost of raw flower production is approximately $0.05 per gram based on historical production of ours and other companies in the same region, as favorably compared to the North American production costs of as opposed to most production between $1.00 and $2.00 per gram that we have observed.
● | Access to scalable land holdings in what we consider to be one of Colombia’s best suited climates for cannabis production in the order of 200 acres. 


12


● | We have all Colombian commercial production approvals and has applied for psychoactive quota for the equivalent of 10,000 kgs of psychoactive flower for 2021 and 85,000 kgs of flower production in 2022, as applied for on April 29, 2021. Non psychoactive production and sales are limitless under current Colombian law. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have engaged what we consider to be one of Colombia’s leading agricultural genetics teams for cannabis production. 
● | The first product shipped in June 2022, and subsequently we have had shipments of 272 kilograms, 200 kilograms 1,728 kilograms and 3,425 kilograms for further distribution. 
● | We shipped 1,728 kilograms of Colombia-grown cannabis to Switzerland in August 2022. 
● | In September 2022 we harvested our first psychoactive THC harvest of 2,200 plants. In October 23 harvested an additional 6,100 plants. These have been dried and cured and will be tested before being offered to sale and export. The production pipeline has additional work packages of approximately 6,000 plants every two to three weeks. We only sell and ship Colombia produced cannabis flower to countries where it is legal to do so. 


In the 2020 fiscal year, we activated our Colombian licenses that are required to produce, extract, import and export psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis. This has been a year-long process that began with the registration of our ten (10) novel strains with the national cultivar registry. Each strain was then germinated into plantlets in our cultivation center in Colombia. Following germination, the plants entered into five (5) months of field trials that included rigorous data collection, analysis and phenotyping of the strains while in the vegetation life cycle. During this time, the strains were provided with propriety nutrients, handled with standard operating procedures and guided towards the plant flowering phase. Proprietary nutrients and procedures were also adhered to during the flowering phase and detailed batch record audit data were diligently collected during every day of the plant life cycle. Following flowering, the plants were harvested and tested for cannabinoid profiles and quality assurance testing parameters. The harvested material was then sent to several accredited testing laboratories and tested its products by high performance liquid chromatography testing methods. Testing was carried in several labs for validation of the results regarding the accuracy of the cannabinoid profiles. 

The lab results from the testing of the cannabis showed a higher cannabinoid profile from being grown in the Colombian climate when compared to the same strains grown in North American climate. The lab results, batch records and procedural archives were also submitted to the Colombian Institute of Agriculture and a day-long presentation was provided by our team. As a result of this process, we received approval for twenty novel strains (ten psychoactive, ten non-psychoactive) from the technical directorate of the ICA, representing a diverse range of chemotypes with novel cannabinoid profiles. 

Our production approach is designed according to the European Pharmacopeia and Good Agricultural Collection Practices (GACP) standards. These standards meet South American, European, US and Canadian quality assurance standards for production of commercialization of cannabis.

In addition, in order to adhere to Canadian production regulations with respect to seed approval and strain-acclimatization, in Canada we have created research and development environments (under personal production licenses approved by the Canada Regulators) that mimic micro-climates in Colombia. We found Bucaramanga to have the best micro climate for production of our plant strains, and accordingly located our Colombian production there. We have stressed the strains with high temperatures and humidity levels to mimic the average natural weather patterns in the areas in which we will be cultivating. This is designed to mitigate the acclimatization risk that we believe many peer companies are experiencing in Colombia.

Our Colombian Cultivation Results

On April 15, 2021 we shared an analysis of our Colombian production harvests. Over this period, we continued to harvest weekly, while adding to our inventory and expanding our analytic data set. 

We have now cultivated several successive Colombian harvests with what we consider to be consistent results. The results showed increased production yield, higher cannabinoid percentages, high quality as measured by cannabinoid potency, as well and as low cost per gram production cost relative to North American production. Our lab results showed a higher cannabinoid profile from being grown in the Colombian climate when compared to similar genotypes of strains grown in North American climate. These lab results, batch records and procedural archives, were submitted to ICA during a day-long presentation by our team, which, in turn, resulted in the approval by the technical directorate of ICA for the ten THC (i.e., psychoactive) strains tested. We believe these THC strains represent a diverse range of chemotypes with novel psychoactive cannabinoid profiles.

In addition to the increase in grams produced per square meter, the cannabinoid percentages showed an increase when produced in Colombia when compared to North America. We have now cultivated several successive harvests with repeatable results. We believe these results suggest we have competitive advantages that we describe as Yield, Cannabinoid Potency, Quality, Cost, Frequency of Harvests.

Increased yield - Approaching One kilogram per Square Meter

We believe we have a proprietary approach to cultivation which fosters high yield production. Our first Colombian harvest yielded 424 grams per square meter of production space. The second harvest, 612 grams per square meter and third and fourth harvest resulted in yields of 684 grams and 893 grams per square meter respectively. The fifth and sixth harvest yielded 894 and 905 grams per square meter respectively. We believe this data shows that our team, is approaching its goal of one kilogram per square meter goal of production output.

Potency-Cannabinoid Production

In Colombia, per our internal testing we have achieved repeatable THC cannabinoid percentages of 29.08% in the psychoactive varieties and CBD percentages of 24.64%. With our continuous quality improvement program, these percentages have continued to increase. The data collected showed that these strain profiles showed a significant increase in cannabinoid content when comparing the output from our Colombian cultivation to our North American cultivation environments. 

Cost of Production - Approximately $0.05 per Gram

Our cash cost of raw flower production is anticipated to be $0.05 cents per gram based on historical production of ours and other companies in the same region. This presents a potential increased margin advantage to multi-state operators within the United States if and when we are able to sell cannabis to the United States, and potentially for wholesale buyers internationally. We believe suggests we can reduce the cost of supply and improve margin for distributors in markets with costs of production between $1.00 - $2.00. 
Quality - Meeting European Pharmacopeia (International) Standards

Our cultivation and production processes meet European Pharmacopeia standards and Good Agricultural Collection Practices (GACP) standards with zero pesticide use, as they were designed from inception. These standards meet South American, European, US and Canadian quality assurance standards for production of commercialization of cannabis. Every cannabis plant is counted and audited during every day of its life cycle. Data collected includes temperature, humidity, pest and disease management indicators. All harvested material is tested for physical identity, aflatoxins, foreign body count, total aerobic plate count, total yeast, e coli, salmonella, bile tolerant gram-negative bacteria, cannabinoids, cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury, terpenes and pesticides. All product is analyzed and approved based upon meeting thresholds for each of the testing parameters.

Frequency of Harvests: We Have Maintained Consistent Production with Weekly Rolling Harvests

Given the advantages that the equatorial climate of Colombia offers, we have been harvesting weekly, suggesting we should be able to offer reliably consistent supplies in large volumes to multiple markets simultaneously.
Our Focused Cultivation and Cannabis Plant Development Approach 

We received approval from the Colombian Ministry of Agriculture (“ICA”) for 20 out of 20 plant strains (10 CBD and 10 THC). ICA reported to us in February 2021 that we were the first company to do so. Our strains have both non-psychoactive and psychoactive varieties that have been legally cultivated both in North America and now in the South America. As a result, we have activated our Colombian licenses for production, extraction, importation and exportation of psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabis. 

This is the culmination of a year-long process that began with the registration of what, in our opinion, are our novel strains with the Colombian national cultivar registry. Each strain was then germinated into plantlets in our cultivation center in Colombia. Following germination, the plants were tested in field trials over five months of field trials that included data collection, analysis and phenotyping of the strains during the vegetation life cycle. These strains were given proprietary nutrients, handled with standard operating procedures guided towards the plant flowering phase, while detailed batch record audit data was collected every day of the plant life cycle. Following flowering, the plants were harvested and tested for cannabinoid profiles and quality assurance testing parameters. The harvested material was then sent to several (accredited testing laboratories and tested by liquid chromatography testing methods for validation of the accuracy of the cannabinoid profiles. 

It should be noted that production is divided into two key types of products: (i) “non-psychoactive” means the strains and genetics with THC levels of less than 1% by weight (ii) “psychoactive” means the strains that have more than 1% THC by weight. Approval of psychoactive cultivation is much more complex than the non-psychoactive approvals in Colombia. In order for a Colombian licensed producer to gain approval to sell and export, the producer must first register their genetics, then go forth and cultivate a limited number of plants as a test harvest. Following the harvest, drying and extraction processing, the product is analyzed and presented to the Colombian Ministry of Agriculture; we have received the requisite approvals from the Colombian Government for each phase of its cannabis development and cultivation.

Our Path from Testing to Approved Cannabis Exports from Colombia

On April 20, 2021 we received clearance from the Colombian authorities to export our harvested non psychoactive cannabis-based products from our first harvest. This milestone was achieved after having undergone the testing and cultivation activities described immediately above herein, and having received the ICA and Colombian Ministry of Justice approvals and licenses described below. Moreover, on April 26, 2021, we received approval to export cannabis-based products to a second international market. 

In October 2020 we were granted from ICA approval to begin the seed evaluation process for our ten non-psychoactive CBD strains. In addition, on April 29, 2021, the Ministry of Justice signed a resolution authorizing us to evaluate our Company’s proprietary strains in order that we could select our best pheno-typed THC psychoactive cannabis strains with the best commercial production characteristics. Along with our previous approval for non-psychoactive evaluation, our subsidiary Allied Colombia S.A.S. could then evaluate all twenty of our psychoactive and non-psychoactive strains.

On October 15, 2020, we received approval from the Colombian Institute of Agriculture (“ICA”) for the cultivation and commercialization of each of our ten proprietary CBD non-psychoactive strains submitted within seed evaluation process which commenced a year earlier. Such enabled us to process and sell our Colombian CBD non-psychoactive production. 


15


On March 9, 2021, we announced that we received ICA approval for the commercialization of its our proprietary THC psychoactive cannabis strains, which was the culmination of the evaluation process for which permission was granted in late April 2020. Each of our ten psychoactive strains were approved and we have passed all of the ICA requirements to be able to cultivate the resultant plants. As a result, we have has applied for a psychoactive export quota for both 2022 and 2023 under the Colombian regulatory regime. These applications are for the oil equivalent of 10,000 kgs of flower and 85,000 kgs of flower for 2022 and 2023. 

Following the first commercial harvest, and in anticipation of requisite ICA and Ministry of Justice approvals, we obtained signed sales off-take contracts with international buyers from Canada, the USA, Europe, and then applied for clearance to export.

Potential United States Production in the Event of Federal Cannabis Legalization

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Allied US Products LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, entered into a contingent asset purchase agreement (the “ Contingent Asset Purchase Agreement”) which allows for the purchase of a Nevada State US-based cannabis license from a subsidiary of Fiore Cannabis, Ltd. upon on the occurrence or waiver of the changes in U.S. federal law to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States (the “Triggering Event”). 

While we have begun to enter into arrangements with United States based companies that may themselves participate in the United States cannabis market, we do not hold any US assets, but rather have a call option to purchase that can be exercisable or exchangeable upon cannabis becoming legal or permissible in the United States under Federal law. 

We will only conduct business activities related to growing or processing cannabis in jurisdictions, including the United States, when it is federally permissible to do so. We are not considered a United States Marijuana Issuer (as defined in the Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-352 - Issuers with United States Marijuana-Related Activities (the “Staff Notice”)) nor do we have material ancillary involvement in the United States. cannabis industry in accordance with the Staff Notice. While we have several arrangements with United States based companies that may themselves participate in the United States cannabis market, these relationships do not violate the federal laws of the United States respecting cannabis and in no manner involve us in any activities in the United States respecting cannabis.

Regulatory Matters

Colombia

Our cultivation operations are in Colombia and are conducted by Allied Colombia S.A.S., a wholly-owned subsidiary. As a cultivator of cannabis, the Company is substantially dependent on the licenses for cultivation, production and other regulatory activities, granted to Allied Colombia by Colombian governmental and regulatory bodies.

Licenses

The Ministries of Health, Justice and Agriculture issued Decree 613 of 2017 to define the licenses that can be granted with respect to permissible activities related to medical cannabis that include: (i) the production of cannabis derivatives; (ii) use of seeds for sowing; (iii) planting of psychoactive cannabis plants; and (iv) planting non-psychoactive cannabis plants.

Apart from a psychoactive cannabis license, Allied Colombia has obtained licenses in each of the above categories, necessary to carry out its operations. Licenses are not transferable, interchangeable, or assignable and are valid for five years and can be renewed for additional five-year periods upon request. Each of the Licenses is current and has not expired. None of the Licenses are subject to current, pending, or compromised regulatory action.

Strains Registration

Allied Colombia has varieties of cannabis in various stages of the registration process. Each strain, whether high or low in THC, must undergo an agronomic evaluation by the agricultural health entity - Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA). For the strains to be included in the National Registry of Cultivars, the following steps must be completed: (i) Genetic Stabilization; (ii) Agronomic Test; (iii) Phase 1 strain registry (legal document that allows the license to enter a strain in the registry); and (iv) Strain registration phase 2 (registration that allows the licensee to market any cannabis product derived from the specific strain in the registry). The harvest is also in the process of agronomic evaluation of additional strains. Based on the yields of each strain, as determined by agronomic testing, Allied Colombia may decide to register fewer strains than available. The decision to complete the registration process of a strain depends on several factors, such as biomass yields, cannabinoid profile, average cannabinoid content, resistance to pests among others as determined by agronomic tests, and the intended uses by the company.

Allied Colombia has twenty varieties of medicinal cannabis registered with the ICA and has the registration as a producer of selected seeds granted by the ICA. Upon receiving the ICA Permit, Allied Colombia commenced commercial cultivation. 

In compliance with its international obligations, Colombia establishes an annual limit for the production volume of cannabis plants and derivatives, which is monitored by the International Narcotics Control Board. Based on this limit, the Colombian government established a quota system, in order to control the amount of psychoactive cannabis production per license. This means that for the Psychoactive Cannabis License, licensees must first apply for a specific crop or manufacturing quota, before beginning production.

According to publicly available information from ICA, as of December 2020, there are 650 companies with license for the production of Cannabis derivatives in Colombia. All companies are at different stages and many are not moving forward. Approximately 10% of these companies have passed their ICA seed evaluation and only a handful of companies have been cleared to export product. Allied Colombia is now one of the Colombian companies cleared to export to more than one international market.

Protection of Environment and Human Health and Safety

We are subject to various Colombian federal, state and local and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Some of our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We also plan to acquire ownership in new facilities and properties, some of which may have had a history of commercial or other operations. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to contamination of sites we own or operate, including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites, abutters or other persons, and the off-site disposal of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil penalties or fines.

18

United States

The United States health care industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governments. Government regulation affects our businesses in several ways, including requiring licensure or certification of facilities. Our ability to conduct our business and to operate profitability depends in part upon obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses and other approvals; and complying with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. 
Regulation of CBD (Medical Cannabidiol Product)

The United States Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Act”) removed hemp, defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% of THC, from Schedule 1 status under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), and Federally legalized the cultivation and sale of hemp, subject to compliance with certain federal requirements and state laws. THC is the psychoactive component of plants in the cannabis family generally identified as marihuana or marijuana. Our medical CBD products are Federally legal in the United States in that they contain less than 0.3% THC in compliance with the 2018 Farm Act guidelines and have no psychoactive effects on our patients and customers. However, there can be no assurance that the 2018 Farm Act will not be repealed or amended such that our products containing hemp-derived CBD would once again be deemed illegal under Federal law in the United States.

The 2018 Farm Act also shifted regulatory authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The 2018 Farm Act did not change the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) oversight authority over CBD products. The 2018 Farm Act delegated authority to regulate and limit the production of hemp and hemp derived products to the state governments. Although many states have adopted laws and regulations that allow for the production and sale of hemp and hemp derived products under certain circumstances, no assurance can be given that such laws of the several states will not be repealed or amended such that our intended products containing hemp-derived CBD would once again be deemed illegal, which in turn would render such intended products illegal in those states under federal law even if the federal law is unchanged. In the event of either repeal of Federal or State laws and regulations, or amendments thereto that are adverse to our intended medical CBD products, we may be restricted or limited with respect to those products that we may sell or distribute, which could adversely impact our intended business plan with respect to such intended products. 

Additionally, the FDA has indicated its view that certain types of products containing CBD may not be permissible under the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA’s position is related to its approval of Epidiolex, a marijuana-derived prescription medicine to be available in the United States. The active ingredient in Epidiolex is CBD. On December 20, 2018, after the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement in which he reiterated the FDA’s position that, among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce and that the FDCA prohibits introducing into interstate commerce food products containing added CBD, and marketing products containing CBD as a dietary supplement, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Although we believe our existing and planned CBD product offerings comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, legal proceedings alleging violations of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Marijuana (Cannabis)

Marijuana (Cannabis) in the United States, cannabis is regulated at the both the Federal and State levels. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis in some states, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), making it illegal under Federal law in the United States to cultivate, distribute, or possess cannabis. Certain states may have enacted statutes and regulations take a permissive approach to medical and/or recreational use of cannabis, the CSA may still be enforced by U.S. Federal law enforcement officials against citizens and businesses of those states for activity that is legal under state law.

19


As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the U.S. federal government regarding cannabis, investments in cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation. The response to this inconsistency was first addressed in August 2013 when then Deputy Attorney General James Cole authored a memorandum (the “Cole Memorandum”), addressed to all U.S. district attorneys acknowledging that notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a controlled substance at the federal level in the United States, several U.S. states have enacted laws relating to cannabis.

The Cole Memorandum outlined certain priorities for the Department of Justice relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. In particular, the Cole Memorandum noted that in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. Notably, however, the Department of Justice has never provided specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems it deems sufficient under the Cole Memorandum standard.

In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis. States where medical cannabis had been legalized were not characterized as a high priority. On January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum (the “Sessions Memorandum”) that rescinded the Cole Memorandum. The Sessions Memorandum rescinded previous nationwide guidance specific to the prosecutorial authority of U.S. attorneys relative to cannabis enforcement on the basis that they are unnecessary, given the well-established principles governing federal prosecution that are already in place. Those principles require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.

As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and therefore it is uncertain how active federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities. Due to the ambiguity of the Sessions Memorandum, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not seek to prosecute cases involving cannabis businesses that are otherwise compliant with state law. 

On January 15, 2019, U.S. Attorney General nominee William P. Barr suggested a different approach to cannabis regulation than Sessions (his predecessor) during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Barr stated that his approach to cannabis regulation would be not to upset settled expectations that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum, that it would be inappropriate to upset the current situation as there has been reliance on the Cole Memorandum and that he would not be targeting companies that have relied on the Cole Memorandum and are complying with state laws with respect to the distribution and production of cannabis. While he did not offer support for cannabis legalization, Mr. Barr did emphasize the need for the U.S. Congress to clarify federal laws to address the untenable current situation which has resulted in a backdoor nullification of federal law.

Additionally, under U.S. federal law it may, under certain circumstances, be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to accept any proceeds from cannabis sales or any other Schedule I controlled substances. Certain Canadian banks are similarly reluctant to transact business with U.S. cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework characterizing the industry at present. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to U.S. cannabis businesses. Under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering or conspiracy. Despite these laws, in February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FCEN”) of the U.S. Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the “FCEN Memo”) providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FCEN Memo states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA. It is unclear at this time whether the Biden administration will follow the guidelines of the FCEN Memo.


20


As previously discussed herein, we plan on expanding our activities to include cannabis and psilocybin product sales and distribution in the United States if and when such activities are legalized by the Federal Government of the United States. 

If Federally legalized in the United States, we expect that our cannabis products will be specifically focused on cannabis for use (i) as a treatment aid; (ii) to provide relief for a large array of neurological and musculoskeletal system disorders; and (iii) as an alternative option for healthcare providers in place of prescribing opioids to patients. Offering our patients access to non-hallucinogenic and non-addictive natural remedies, under required clinical oversight policies and procedures as they relate to medicinal cannabis, combined with our existing clinic-based treatment protocols may allow us to provide a unique model that we do not believe is readily available in the United States.

Other Medical Practice Regulation

The United States healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we may provide cannabis products, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities, and other aspects of our planned operations in the event such activities become Federally legal in the United States, of which there can be no assurance. Of particular importance are:

● | The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration for referring an individual, in return for ordering, leasing, purchasing or recommending or arranging for, or to induce the referral of an individual or the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services covered, in whole or in part, by any federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The criminal healthcare fraud provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), and related rules which prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent, to violate it to have committed a violation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, and false claims issues. 
● | State laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions, or engaging in certain practices such as splitting fees with physicians. 
● | Laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices. 


Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment, and loss of status. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could impose liability on us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from business operations, and result in adverse publicity.


21

Packaging, Labeling and Advertising

The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, HHS, the USDA and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various state, local and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost sales and increased costs to the Company. A regulatory agency may not accept the evidence of safety for any new ingredients that we may want to market, or may determine that a particular product or product ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk. Regulatory agencies may also determine that a particular statement of nutritional support on our products, or a statement that we want to use on our products, is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a food “health claim,” or that particular claims are not adequately supported by available scientific evidence. Any such regulatory determination could prevent us from marketing particular products or using certain statements on those products, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
Canada

On October 17, 2018 marijuana in Canada became Federally legal.

According to Canadian Federal law, adults are legally permitted to purchase, use, possess, and grow recreational cannabis. The legal age and cultivation laws vary depending on the province. The minimum legal age is 19 in Canada except in the provinces of Alberta and Quebec where it is 18.

The maximum amount one is allowed to possess from a recreational source is 30 grams in all Canadian provinces, but in most locations, one is allowed to have larger amounts at home. In British Columbia for example, a person may possess up to 1,000 grams of marijuana at home. There is no limit to home possession in Manitoba. Those with a prescription are authorized to possess up to a five-day amount of their prescribed amount of medical cannabis. 

Legal Proceedings

We are not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties 

Employees

As of the date of this Offering Circular, the Company has approximately 15 contracted employees. Our wholly-owned subsidiary Allied Colombia, S.A.S. has approximately 150 employees who farm and produce our cannabis products.  The Company does not intend to pay a full salary to any of its executives or management at this time, but has entered into certain consulting agreements. (See “Executive Compensation”). The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.
