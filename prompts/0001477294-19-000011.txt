ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company
The reporting company is Sensata Technologies Holding plc ("Sensata plc"), the successor issuer to Sensata Technologies Holding N.V. ("Sensata N.V."), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the "Company," "Sensata," "we," "our," and "us."
On September 28, 2017, the Board of Directors of Sensata N.V. unanimously approved a plan to change our location of incorporation from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom (the "U.K."). To effect this change, on February 16, 2018 the shareholders of Sensata N.V. approved a cross-border merger between Sensata N.V. and Sensata plc, a newly formed, public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, with Sensata plc being the surviving entity (the "Merger"). 
We received approval of the Merger by the U.K. High Court of Justice, and the Merger was completed, on March 28, 2018. As a result thereof, Sensata plc became the publicly-traded parent of the subsidiary companies that were previously controlled by Sensata N.V., with no changes made to the business being conducted by us prior to the Merger. Due to the fact that the Merger was a business combination between entities under common control, the assets and liabilities exchanged were accounted for at their carrying values.
Overview
Sensata plc conducts its operations through subsidiary companies that operate business and product development centers primarily in Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, the U.K., and the United States (the "U.S."); and manufacturing operations primarily in Bulgaria, China, Germany, Malaysia, Mexico, the U.K., and the U.S. 
We develop, manufacture, and sell a wide range of customized sensors and controls that address increasingly complex engineering requirements for specific customer applications and systems such as air conditioning, braking, exhaust, fuel oil, tire, operator controls, and transmission in automotive and heavy vehicle and off-road ("HVOR") systems, and temperature and electrical protection and control in numerous industrial applications, including aircraft, refrigeration, material handling, telecommunications, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems. The acquisition of GIGAVAC, LLC ("GIGAVAC"), discussed further below, expands our product offerings to include high voltage contactors and fuses. We can trace our origins back to entities that have been engaged in the sensors and controls business since 1916. 
Our sensors are devices that translate a physical phenomenon, such as pressure, temperature, or position, into electronic signals that microprocessors or computer-based control systems can act upon. Our controls are devices embedded within systems to protect them from excessive heat or current. Underlying these sensors and controls are core technology platforms—thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit protection, micro electromechanical systems, ceramic capacitance, Microfused Silicon Strain Gage, and wireless communication protocol—that we leverage across multiple products and applications, enabling us to optimize our substantial research, development, and engineering investments and achieve economies of scale.
By locating our global engineering teams in close proximity to key customers in regional business centers, we are exposed to many development opportunities at an early stage and work closely with our customers to deliver solutions that meet their needs. As a result of the long development lead times and embedded nature of our products, we collaborate closely with our customers throughout the design and development phase of their products. Systems development by our customers typically requires significant multi-year investment for certification and qualification, which are often government or customer mandated. We believe the capital commitment and time required for this process significantly increases the switching costs once a customer has designed and installed a particular sensor or control into a system.
We have a diverse revenue mix by geography, customer, and end market. We organize the sales and marketing function within our business into regions—the Americas, Asia, and Europe—but also globally across all geographies according to market segments, so as to facilitate knowledge sharing and coordinate activities involving our larger customers through global account managers. 
Refer to Note 20, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto (our "Financial Statements") included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Report") for details of our net revenue and property, plant and equipment, net by region. Refer to Note 3, "Revenue Recognition," of our Financial Statements for details of our net revenue by end market.

We organize our business into two segments: Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions. Performance Sensing designs and manufactures sensors for the automotive and HVOR markets, including low-, medium-, and high-pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, and temperature sensors, and markets them to leading global automotive and HVOR original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and their Tier 1 suppliers. Sensing Solutions designs and manufactures various sensors and control products, including bimetal electromechanical controls, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, solid state relays, power inverters, interconnection products, and temperature, pressure, and position sensors, selling them to a wide range of industrial and commercial manufacturers and suppliers across multiple end markets. The acquisition of GIGAVAC, portions of which will be integrated into each of our operating segments, expands our product offerings to include high voltage contactors and fuses. 
Customers
We have long-standing relationships with a geographically diverse base of leading OEMs and other multinational companies. In geographic and product markets where we lack an established base of customers, we rely on third-party distributors to sell our sensors and control products. We have had relationships with our top ten customers for an average of 29 years. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 8% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Performance Sensing customers consist primarily of leading global automotive and HVOR OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers. Our products are ultimately used by the majority of global automotive OEMs, providing us with a balanced customer portfolio, which, we believe, helps to protect us against global shifts in market share between different OEMs. Sensing Solutions customers include a wide range of industrial and commercial manufacturers and suppliers across multiple end markets, primarily OEMs in the climate control, appliance, semiconductor, medical, energy and infrastructure, data/telecom, and aerospace industries, as well as Tier 1 aerospace and motor and compressor suppliers.
Seasonality
Because of the diverse global nature of the markets in which we operate, our net revenue is only moderately impacted by seasonality. However, Sensing Solutions experiences some seasonality, specifically in its air conditioning and refrigeration products, which tend to peak in the first two quarters of the year as inventory is built up for spring and summer sales. In addition, Performance Sensing net revenue tends to be weaker in the third quarter of the year as automotive OEMs retool production lines for the coming model year.
Acquisition and Divestiture History
In August 2018 we completed the sale of the capital stock of Schrader Bridgeport International, Inc. and August France Holding Company SAS (collectively, the "Valves Business") to Pacific Industrial Co. Ltd. The Valves Business, which we acquired in connection with the acquisition of Schrader in 2014, manufactures mechanical valves for pressure applications in tires and fluid control and assembles tire hardware aftermarket products with manufacturing locations in the U.S. and Europe. Refer to Note 17, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," of our Financial Statements for additional details on this divestiture.
In October 2018 we acquired GIGAVAC, an industry-leading producer of high voltage contactors and fuses that are mission-critical components for electric vehicles and equipment, for $233.0 million of cash consideration, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The acquisition of GIGAVAC extends our capabilities on battery electric vehicles, with significant potential for additional growth, and will enable us to tap into a broad market opportunity for high-voltage contactors required in mission-critical sensing and electrical protection applications across electrified vehicles and industrial equipment such as cars, delivery trucks, busses, material handling equipment, and charging stations. It will immediately augment our ongoing investments in electrification for many complex and challenging applications in the automotive, battery storage, industrial, and HVOR markets. Refer to Note 17, "Acquisitions and Divestitures," of our Financial Statements for additional details on this acquisition.

Performance Sensing Segment
Overview
Performance Sensing, which accounted for approximately 75% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2018, is a developer and manufacturer of a broad portfolio of application-specific sensors, including pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, and temperature sensors, that are used in a wide variety of automotive and HVOR applications. The acquisition of GIGAVAC, portions of which will be integrated into each of our operating segments, expands our product offerings to include high voltage contactors and fuses. 
We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of pressure and high temperature sensors in the majority of the key markets in which we compete. 
Markets
Performance Sensing primarily serves the automotive and HVOR sensor markets through the design, manufacture, and sale of various types of sensors. Refer to the Product Categories section below for a summary of the key products, solutions, applications, systems, and end markets for our sensor product category. 
The global sensor market is characterized by a broad range of products and applications across a diverse set of market segments. We believe large OEMs and other multinational companies are increasingly demanding a global presence to supply sensors for their key global platforms. According to an October 2018 report prepared by Strategy Analytics, Inc., the global automotive sensor market was $24.3 billion in 2018, compared to $23.2 billion in 2017. 
The automotive and HVOR sensor markets are characterized by high switching costs and barriers to entry, benefiting incumbent market leaders. Sensors enable a wide variety of applications, and many are critical components that are essential to the proper functioning of the products in which they are incorporated. Sensor application-specific products require close engineering collaboration between the sensor supplier and the OEM or the Tier 1 supplier. As a result, OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers make significant investments in selecting, integrating, and testing sensors as part of their product development. Switching to a different sensor results in considerable additional work, both in terms of sensor customization and extensive platform/product retesting and certification. This results in high switching costs for automotive and HVOR manufacturers once a sensor is designed in. We believe this is one of the reasons that sensors are rarely changed during a platform life-cycle, which in the case of the automotive industry typically lasts five to seven years. Given the importance of reliability and the fact that the sensors must be supported through the length of a product life, our experience has been that OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers tend to work with suppliers that have a long track record of quality and on-time delivery and the scale and resources to meet their needs as the automobile platform evolves and grows. In addition, the automotive industry provides one of the largest markets for sensors, giving participants with a presence in this market significant scale advantages over those participating only in smaller, more niche industrial and medical markets.
Net revenue growth from the automotive and HVOR markets served by Performance Sensing has historically been driven, we believe, by three principal trends, including (1) growth in the number of vehicles produced globally, (2) expansion in the number of sensors per vehicle, and (3) a shift towards higher value sensors. We are also investing in new technologies that we believe will shape future revenue growth by increasing content per vehicle. In addition, our presence in emerging markets positions us to take advantage of future growth opportunities in these regions.

Light vehicle production: Global production of light vehicles has consistently demonstrated annual growth since the recession in 2008 and 2009 and is expected to continue to increase over the long term due to population growth and increased usage of cars in emerging markets. According to the fourth quarter 2018 LMC Automotive "Global Car & Truck Forecast," the production of global light vehicles in 2018 was approximately 94.7 million units, a decrease of 0.4% from 2017.
Number of sensors per vehicle: We believe that the increasing installation in vehicles of emissions, efficiency, safety, and comfort-related features that depend on sensors for proper functioning, such as electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring, advanced driver assistance, transmission, and advanced combustion and exhaust after-treatment, as well as user interfaces in HVOR applications, will continue to drive increased sensor usage and content growth. For example, government regulation of emissions, including fuel economy standards such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements in the U.S. and emissions requirements such as "Euro 6d" in Europe and "China National 6" in China lead to sensor-rich automobile powertrain strategies.
Other applications that are driving increased sensor content in vehicles include braking systems, which are transitioning from traditional hydraulic brakes towards electromechanical braking and regenerative braking systems, and electrified vehicles, which require tighter temperature control for efficient operation, driving more sophisticated thermal management systems to control heating and cooling throughout the vehicle.
Higher value sensors: We believe that our revenue growth has been augmented by a continuing shift away from legacy electromechanical products towards higher-value electronic solid-state sensors.
New Technology: As automobiles and heavy vehicles evolve, new alternative technologies are being developed to make these vehicles more efficient, robust, cost effective, and safe. We believe that emerging opportunities, or ("megatrends"), have the potential to grow our business for the foreseeable future, particularly in the areas of electrification, smart & connected, and autonomy. For example, we expect this growth to include content growth in both hybrid and electric vehicles, which require systems and sensors to drive high efficiency across the powertrain, managing better diagnostics, more efficient combustion, and reduced emissions. In addition, we are taking steps and making investments with the intent of positioning ourselves to capitalize on what we believe will be a large, attractive market for autonomous vehicles. In addition, we continue to engage with customers who are seeking enabling sensor technology for autonomous driving. 
Also, sensor content on vehicle climate control and thermal management systems, where we enjoy high market share, is increasing. This is driven by the need for high efficiency control of thermal management in hybrid heating and cooling systems. Additionally, as long range plug-in hybrid and full battery electric vehicles gain share, multiple instances of efficient thermal management across the battery, electronics, and cabin systems is required to protect and manage the vehicle, which drive additional core Sensata sensor content on the market today. Other new emerging opportunities to improve on-vehicle energy density and battery life could also provide the potential for additional content per vehicle.
Other safety systems are also evolving on hybrid and electric vehicles. New and emerging energy recuperation technologies, such as regenerative motors, require additional sensing content to manage and efficiently switch between traditional braking systems and regenerative braking. Additionally, semi-automated vehicles containing advanced driver assistance systems benefit from more efficient and faster electromechanical braking systems, driving additional sensor content to control these brakes. Each of these systems enable more efficient use of energy, enabling greater electric vehicle range.
New content in high voltage electrical protection from our recent acquisition of GIGAVAC addresses many of the needs in evolving electric vehicle powertrain systems. These higher voltage systems must be adequately controlled and protected as vehicle voltages and currents increase. This protection is critical both in safeguarding the expensive electronics used to power the vehicle, and allows for an increase in power levels to improve charging times. These high voltage contactors are critical components in multiple sockets on all highly electrified vehicles.
Moreover, we believe our broad customer base, global diversification, and evolving portfolio provide the foundation that will allow us to grow with these megatrends across a diverse set of markets.
Emerging Markets: We have a long-standing position in emerging markets, including a presence in China for more than 20 years. With our presence in China, we believe that our automotive and HVOR businesses are well positioned to grow. With sustained vehicle modernization in China, we expect our content per vehicle in China will continue to increase, moving towards the levels we see in developed markets.

Product Categories
Prior to fiscal year 2018, we presented four significant product categories in Performance Sensing: pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, temperature sensors, and pressure switches. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, we are categorizing our products more broadly, as sensors, controls, or other, to better reflect how we view our products. 
The following table presents the key products, solutions, applications, systems, and end markets related to the sensor product category (Performance Sensing sales of controls is immaterial and is not separately presented below):

Key Products/Solutions | Key Applications/Systems | Key End Markets

Performance Sensing net revenue | $ | 2,627,651 | | | $ | 2,460,600 | | $ | 2,385,380

Competitors
Within each of the principal product categories in Performance Sensing, we compete with a variety of independent suppliers as well as the in-house operations of Tier 1 systems suppliers. We believe that the key competitive factors in the markets served by this segment are product performance, quality and reliability, the ability to produce customized solutions on a global basis, technical expertise, development capability, breadth and scale of product offerings, product service and responsiveness, and a commercially competitive offering. 
Sensing Solutions Segment
Overview
Sensing Solutions, which accounted for approximately 25% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2018, is a developer and manufacturer of a broad portfolio of application-specific products, including bimetal electromechanical controls, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, solid state relays, power inverters, interconnection products, and temperature, pressure, and position sensors, that are used in a wide variety of applications in various end-markets, including aerospace and defense, industrial, appliance, and HVAC. Our products help our customers' systems run safely and in an efficient and environmentally-friendly manner. The acquisition of GIGAVAC, portions of which will be integrated into each of our operating segments, expands our product offerings to include high voltage contactors and fuses. 
We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of controls in the majority of the key applications in which we compete. 
Markets
Sensing Solutions designs and manufactures various categories of products, each of which serves a variety of markets. Refer to the Product Categories section below for a summary of the key products, solutions, applications, systems, and end markets for each of our significant product categories.

These products perform many functions in the applications in which they are used. Bimetal electromechanical controls and thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers help prevent damage from excess heat or electrical current. Solid state relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a low-power signal, or where several circuits must also be controlled by one signal. Solid state relays have certain advantages over mechanical relays, including long operation life, silent operation, low power, and low electrical interference. Sensors provided by Sensing Solutions employ similar technology to the automotive and HVOR sensors discussed in the Performance Sensing Segment section above, but often require different customization in terms of packaging, calibration, and electrical output. These sensors measure specific parameters in order to provide real-time information about the state of a specific system or subsystem, so control adjustments can be made to optimize system performance. Power inverters and charge controllers enable conversion of electric power from direct current ("DC") power to alternating current ("AC") power, or AC power to DC power. Our interconnection products consist of semiconductor burn-in test sockets used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify packaged semiconductor reliability. 
The demand for bimetal electromechanical controls and thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers tend to follow the general economic environment and is affected by the increasing significance of new electronically-controlled applications. Demand for our sensor products used in industrial and commercial applications is driven by many of the same factors as in the automotive sensor market: regulation of emissions, greater energy efficiency, and safety, as well as consumer demand for new features. For example, many HVAC/Refrigeration ("HVAC/R") and industrial systems are converting to more efficient variable speed control, which inherently requires more sensor feedback than traditional fixed speed control systems. Global trends towards environmentally friendly refrigerants also require more sensors to deliver the desired system performance. Demand for power inverters and charge controllers is driven by economic development, the need to meet new energy efficiency standards, electrification of auxiliary loads on work trucks, emerging opportunities for residential energy storage and off-grid power systems, and a growing interest in clean energy to replace generators, which increases demand for both mobile and stationary power. Demand in the semiconductor market is driven by consumer and business computational, entertainment, transportation, and communication needs. These needs are driven by the desire to have smaller, lighter, faster, more functional, and energy conscious devices that make users more productive and interconnected to society. 
Sensing Solutions benefits from strong agency relationships. For example, a number of electrical standards for motor control products, including portions of the Underwriters' Laboratory ("UL") Standards for Safety, have been written based on the performance and specifications of our control products. We also have U.S. and Canadian Component Recognitions from UL for many of our control products, so that customers can use Klixon®, Crydom®, and Airpax® products throughout North America. Where our component parts are detailed in our customers' certifications from UL, changes to their certifications may be necessary in order for them to incorporate competitors' offerings. Similarly, our aerospace products undergo exhaustive qualification procedures to customer or military performance standards, requiring a significant investment in a re-qualification effort to incorporate competitors’ offerings.
We continue to focus our efforts on expanding our presence in all global geographies, both emerging and mature. Our customers include established multinationals, as well as local producers in emerging markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe, and Turkey. China continues to remain a priority for us because of its export focus and the increasing domestic consumption of products that use our devices. In addition, we continue to focus on managing our costs and increasing our productivity in these lower-cost manufacturing regions.
Product Categories
Prior to fiscal year 2018, we presented five significant product categories in Sensing Solutions: bimetal electromechanical controls, industrial and aerospace sensors, power conversion and control, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, and interconnection. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, we are categorizing our products more broadly, as sensors, controls, or other, to better reflect how we view our products.

Sensing Solutions net revenue | $ | 893,976 | | | $ | 846,133 | | $ | 816,908

Competitors
Within each of the principal product categories in Sensing Solutions, we compete with divisions of large multinational industrial corporations and companies with smaller market share that compete primarily in specific markets, applications, or products. We believe that the key competitive factors in these markets are product performance, quality, and reliability, although manufacturers in certain markets also compete based on price. Physical proximity to the facilities of the OEM/Tier 1 manufacturer customer has, in our experience, also increasingly become a basis for competition. We have additionally found that certain of our product categories have other specific competitive factors. For example, strength of technology, quality, and the ability to provide custom solutions are particularly important in thermal circuit breaker, thermostat, and switch products. With hydraulic-magnetic circuit breakers, as another example, we have encountered heightened competition on price and a greater emphasis on agency approvals, including approvals by the UL, a U.S.-based organization that issues safety standards for many electrical products in the U.S., military agencies, and similar organizations outside of the U.S., such as Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik, and TÜV Rheinland in Europe, China Compulsory Certification in China, and Canadian Standards Association in Canada.
Technology and Intellectual Property
We develop products that address increasingly complex engineering requirements. We believe that continued focused investment in research and development ("R&D") is critical to our future growth and maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. Our R&D efforts are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our core business strategy. We continuously develop our technologies to meet an evolving set of customer requirements and new product introductions. In addition, we constantly consider new technologies where we may have expertise for potential investment or acquisition. We incurred R&D expense of $147.3 million, $130.1 million, and $126.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 10

We rely primarily on patents, trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. While we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall business is dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. Many of our patents protect specific functionality in our products, and others consist of processes or techniques that result in reduced manufacturing costs. 
The following table presents information on our patents and patent applications as of December 31, 2018:

 | U.S. | Non-U.S.
Patents | 324 | | 450
Pending patent applications, filed within the last five years | 34 | | 209

Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2042. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and license various patents and trademarks. "Sensata" and our logo are trademarks.
We use licensing arrangements with respect to certain technology provided in our sensor products and, to a lesser extent, our control products. In 2006, we entered into a perpetual, royalty-free cross-license agreement with our former owner, Texas Instruments Incorporated, which permits each party to use specified technology owned by the other party in its business. No license may be terminated under the agreement, even in the event of a material breach. 
We purchase sense element assemblies, which are components used primarily in our monosilicon strain gage pressure sensors, from Measurement Specialties, Inc. and its affiliates ("MEAS") and also manufacture them internally as a second source. In March 2013, we entered into an intellectual property licensing arrangement (the "License Agreement") with MEAS that provides for an indefinite duration license and is subject to royalties through 2019 and thereafter is royalty-free. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, we are authorized to produce our entire need for these sense elements within the passenger vehicle and heavy-duty truck fields of use. The License Agreement can be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach. As of December 31, 2018, we only purchase sense element assemblies from MEAS that relate to limited industrial applications. We manufacture the rest internally.
The following table presents net revenue realized related to the sense element assemblies subject to the License Agreement:

 | For the year ended December 31,
(Dollars in millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Net revenue: | | | | | 
Manufactured by Sensata | $ | 424.6 | | | $ | 348.4 | | $ | 247.1
Manufactured by MEAS | 8.8 | | | 64.8 | | | 150.6
Total net revenue subject to License Agreement | $ | 433.4 | | | $ | 413.2 | | $ | 397.7

Raw Materials
We use a broad range of manufactured components, subassemblies, and raw materials in the manufacture of our products, including those containing certain commodities, resins, and rare earth metals, which may experience significant volatility in their price and availability. 
The price and availability of raw materials and manufactured components may be subject to change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations and global economic or political events including strikes, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and prevailing price levels. It is generally difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases. Therefore, a significant increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these items could materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 21,650 employees, of whom approximately 8% were located in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 120 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, in various countries, local law requires our participation in works councils. We also engage contract workers in multiple locations, primarily to cost-effectively manage variations in manufacturing volume, but also to perform engineering and other general services. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,050 contract workers on a worldwide basis. We believe 
 11

that our relations with our employees are good. However, as discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors," included elsewhere in this Report, the loss of key employees or material work stoppages at our or our customers' manufacturing sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Environmental Regulations
Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, both domestic and foreign, including those governing air emissions, chemical usage, water discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We are, however, not aware of any threatened or pending material environmental investigations, lawsuits, or claims involving us or our operations. 
Many of our products are governed by material content restrictions and reporting requirements, examples of which include: European Union regulations, such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"), Restriction of Hazardous Substances ("RoHS"), and End of Life Vehicles ("ELV"); U.S. regulations, such as the conflict minerals requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and similar regulations in other countries. Further, numerous customers, across all end markets, are requiring us to provide declarations of compliance or, in some cases, full material content disclosure as a requirement of doing business with them.
Compliance with these laws and meeting customer requirements has increased our cost of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. We do not currently expect any material capital expenditures during fiscal year 2019 for environmental control facilities. We also do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect in the foreseeable future on our business or the markets we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position, or financial standing.
Governmental Regulations
We are subject to compliance with laws and regulations controlling the import and export of goods and services. Certain of our products are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation ("ITAR"). The export of many such ITAR-controlled products requires an individual validated license from the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The State Department makes licensing decisions based on type of product, destination of end use, end user, national security, and foreign policy. We have a trade compliance team and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with import and export regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to import or export raw material and finished goods across various jurisdictions. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to change technology or incur expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.
Available Information
