GENERAL
 
The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “our Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” “BlackStar,” or the “Company” are to BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
We are engaged in Merchant Banking and Finance and we have recognized net losses of ($411,380) in the year ended December 31, 2018. We have relied solely on sales of our securities to fund our operations. To execute our business plan, our parent company, International Hedge Group, Inc., through a Securities Purchase Agreement dated January 25, 2016, acquired 44,400,000 shares of the common stock and the Class A Super Majority Voting Preferred Stock of our Company for $100,000 in August 2016, and for an additional $100,000 in October 2016. The Company then completed a private placement offering pursuant to the offering exemption under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, raising $165,000. On November 29, 2018, BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. and Power Up Lending Group Ltd. entered into a convertible promissory note totaling $53,000 and a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) (Form 8-K filed Dec. 14, 2018) in order to fund continued operations of the

Company. The Company intends to raise additional funds in order to fund operations of the merchant bank, and to expand its services into the blockchain industry. To fund ongoing operations, we may raise funds in the future, which are not yet committed.
 
Reports to Security Holders
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and as such, we intend to file all required disclosures.
 
You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC in the SEC’s Public Reference Section, Room 1580, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Section by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) as we did not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as of December 31, 2018, our last fiscal year.
 
We may lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year during which (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1,000,000,000 or (ii) we issue more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt in a three-year period. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company if at any time we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We will lose our status as an emerging growth company on the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement.
 
As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable to generally reporting companies. These provisions include:
 

- | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statement and only two years of related Management Discussion and Analysis Disclosures:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such sections are provided below:
 
Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires a public company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls.
 
Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities and Exchange Act, implemented by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act, require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation.
 
We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities

Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. 
 
HISTORY
 
Our Company, BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. (“BlackStar Enterprise,” “We,” or the “Company”) was originally formed on December 17, 2007 as NPI08, Inc. in the State of Delaware. Our name was changed in 2010 to BlackStar Energy Group, Inc. In August of 2016, our name was changed to BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc.
 
Our Company was divested from Kingsley Capital, Inc. in a bankruptcy proceeding in 2008, in which Kingsley was the debtor. Our Company attempted to start up in the energy business in 2010 without success, resulting in losses totaling $1,819,530 over a three-year period. Our Company was inactive until 2016 when new management and capital were introduced.
 
BlackStar Enterprise is engaged in Merchant Banking and Finance. BlackStar Enterprise’s venue is private early stage companies throughout various industries that, in our judgement, exhibit a potential for sustained growth. We are a publicly traded specialized merchant banking firm, facilitating joint venture capital to early stage revenue companies. We are actively seeking opportunity for discussion with revenue generating enterprises and emerging companies for financing. BlackStar intends to offer consulting and regulatory compliance services to crypto-equity companies, and blockchain entrepreneurs for securities, tax, and commodity issues. BlackStar is conducting ongoing analysis for opportunities in involvement in crypto-equity related ventures though our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crypto Equity Management Corp. (“CEMC”) formed in September 2017. BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. is traded on the OTC QB under the symbol “BEGI.” Further details about the business plan for CEMC, the operating subsidiary of BlackStar, can be found in the “Current Business” section below. 
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 4450 Arapahoe Ave., Suite 100, Boulder, CO 80303 and our office telephone number is (303) 500-5073. We maintain a website at www.blackstarenterprisegroup.com, and such website is not incorporated into or a part of this filing.
 
International Hedge Group, Inc. (“IHG”), our parent company, contracted to acquire 95% of our outstanding stock in January 2016 and closed on the purchase in summer of 2016. In lieu of the 95% of common shares originally agreed upon, IHG received 44,400,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 of Class A Preferred Stock. IHG is our controlling shareholder and is engaged in providing management services to companies, and, on occasion, capital consulting. IHG’s strategy in investing in BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. is to own a controlling interest in a publicly quoted company which has the mission to engage in funding of start-up and developed business ventures using its stock for private placement or public offerings. IHG and BlackStar are currently managed and controlled by the same individuals, but IHG and BlackStar may each seek its funding from different and as yet, undetermined sources, with funding structures of different natures.
 
Definitions
 
As used throughout this annual report on Form 10-K, capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the filing. The following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
 
BlackStar Digital Trading Platform (“BDTP”): a peer-to-peer digital equity trading platform enabling the trading of registered BlackStar Digital Equities only.
 
BlackStar Digital Equity: a digitally evidenced share of BlackStar common stock holding the same characteristics as securities evidenced by a paper certificate which has been transmitted and protected by cryptographic protocols.
 
Blockchain: a disintermediating technology, where each transaction is cryptographically signed, and always appended to an immutable ledger, visible to all participants, and distributed across boundaries of trust. The ledger runs on a set of nodes, each of which may be under the control of a separate company, individual or organization.
  
4
-

These nodes connect to each other in a dense peer-to-peer network so that no one node acts as a central point of control or failure. There is no need for a central intermediary, where one central database is used to rule transaction validity. A ledger is both a network and a database. It has rules and built-in security, and it maintains internal integrity and its own history. Once a ledger transaction has received a sufficient level of validation, some cryptography ensures that it can never be replaced or reversed. Transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable.
 
Digital Shares: common shares holding the same characteristics as securities evidenced by a paper certificate but are recorded via electronic book-entry through the Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian (“DWAC”) system in digital form and are protected by cryptographic protocols.
 
CORPORATE STRUCTURE
 
Our corporate structure is as follows:

BLACKSTAR ENTERPRISE GROUP, INC. (a Delaware corporation) 
Crypto Equity Management Corp. (a Colorado corporation) | Crypto Industry SRO Inc. (a Colorado non-profit corporation)

CURRENT BUSINESS
 
Our Company, BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. (OTC QB: BEGI) is a publicly traded merchant banking firm seeking to facilitate venture capital to early stage revenue companies. BlackStar intends to offer consulting and regulatory compliance services to blockchain and DLT companies and blockchain entrepreneurs for securities, tax, and commodity issues. BlackStar is conducting ongoing analysis for opportunities in involvement in crypto-related ventures though our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Crypto Equity Management Corp., (“CEMC”), mainly in the areas of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. BlackStar intends to serve businesses in their early corporate lifecycles and may provide funding in the forms of ventures in which we control the venture until divestiture or spin-off by developing the businesses with capital. We have only engaged in one transaction as a merchant bank form to date.
 
Our investment strategy focuses primarily on ventures with companies that we believe are poised to grow at above-average rates relative to other sectors of the U.S. economy, which we refer to as "emerging growth companies." Under no circumstances does the company intend to become an investment company and its activities and its financial statement ratios of assets and cash will be carefully monitored and other activities reviewed by the Board to prevent being classified or inadvertently becoming an investment company which would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
BlackStar is conducting a continuing analysis for the Company’s involvement in Distributed Ledger Technology (“DLT”) related ventures. To pursue that end, the Company formed a subsidiary, Crypto Equity Management Corp. (“CEMC”), on September 30, 2017. As a merchant bank, BlackStar intends to seek to provide access to capital for companies and is specifically seeking out ventures involved in DLT. BlackStar recognizes the similarities in the rapidly evolving DLT ecosystem today compared to the Dot Com era in the 90’s, which present both challenges and opportunities. BlackStar intends to facilitate funding and management of DLT involved companies through majority controlled joint ventures through its subsidiary Crypto Equity Management Corp.  BlackStar, through CEMC, intends to initially control and manage each venture. Potential ventures for both BlackStar and CEMC will be analyzed using the combined business experience of its executives, with CEMC looking to fill those venture criteria with companies in crypto-related businesses such as blockchain or DLT technologies. The Company does not intend
  
5
-

to develop Investment Objectives or “criteria” in any manner but will rely on the acumen and experience of its executives.
 
Additional Steps Taken – In June of 2017, the management of BlackStar began analyzing the crypto industry due in large part to its rapid ascent in popularity. Mr. Kurczodyna took an educational legal seminar on securities laws relating to blockchain, attended national and international conferences on cryptocurrency, and spoke with several experts at each event, informing himself about the industry, regulations, and potential pitfalls. Mr. Kurczodyna believed that many of the unregistered cryptocurrency offerings that had occurred throughout much of 2016 and 2017 were “illegal unregistered securities” offerings and that BlackStar could design and implement a better strategy for future capital raising using the security benefits of blockchain technology, perhaps in digital equity.
 
After significant study and discussions with multiple vendors and service providers in the digital currency industries, in May 2018 BlackStar retained Solidgreen Software, LLC, d/b/a Artuova (“Artuova”) to design a technological plan and an overall estimated cost of implementation of an equity trading platform (agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4). BlackStar intends to assign the contract to CEMC so that CEMC may continue to handle crypto-related ventures as the operating subsidiary of BlackStar. CEMC currently plans to build the referenced digital equity trading platform in order to trade BlackStar shares as registered Digital Shares, only after the securities have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
We estimate developing the BDTP at a cost of $105,000 USD over the next five months. As of the date of this Form 10-K, BDTP has been completely designed in terms of the following components: data model, reports, web-based user interface, blockchain interface, transaction logic, and cloud interface.
 
We have contracted the services of Dr. David Gnabasik, a computer scientist contractor of Artuova and a former employee of Colorado Parks and Wildlife, who has demonstrated a working blockchain project for managing licenses for Parks and Wildlife state agencies.
 
On November 29, 2018, the Company and Power Up Lending Group Ltd. entered into a convertible promissory note totaling $53,000 and a Securities Purchase Agreement in order to continue funding the development of the BDTP and ongoing operations (Form 8-K filed Dec. 14, 2018).
 
Risk Management Framework – We currently have no risk management framework for addressing material risks associated with this new business strategy and our decisions will be guided by management’s judgment and experience.
Nature and Types of Services Provided – As a subsidiary of BlackStar, CEMC additionally intends to offer consulting and regulatory compliance services to cryptocurrency entities and blockchain entrepreneurs for securities, tax, and commodity issues. Our Company has always operated under the assumption that cryptocurrencies and tokens are “securities” and regulated under the SEC rules and in some circumstances, the CFTC rules. Due to significant experience of our management in the US securities and commodities industry, we felt that we had regulatory compliance backgrounds that could be useful in assisting with regulatory compliance for former cryptocurrency offerors and token offerors. In the 1990s, Mr. Kurczodyna was formerly the majority shareholder, general principal, and financial principal assistant of a Broker-Dealer (BD) registered with the SEC and an Introducing-Broker (IB) with the CFTC, Mills Financial Services Inc. (“Mills”). In his time at Mills, Mr. Kurczodyna wrote the policies and procedures such as: know your client; preventing the misuse of material non-public information; books and records requirements; and financial responsibility rules including the requirements concerning the safeguarding and custody of customer funds and securities. The lack of management’s cryptocurrency experience is applicable to virtually all the current “experienced” cryptocurrency executives and since BlackStar has always operated under the assumption that cryptocurrencies were securities, the securities experience applied to the cryptocurrency industry seemed like a natural progression. Other companies’ principals have been offering unregistered securities with multiple violations of securities and other laws including FinCen

6
-

regulation, CFTC rules, exchange rules, AML, and tax laws. The concept of CEMC as a subsidiary of BlackStar was to provide compliance services for the multitude of laws that are applicable.
 
Expertise and Experience – The management of BlackStar have each been involved in the securities and financial markets for well over 40 years and understand many of the intricate rules and regulations surrounding securities/commodities in general. Through CEMC, the management plans to pass on this knowledge and connect the cryptocurrency and blockchain entities with the correct industry experts. CEMC will bring in technology and/or cryptocurrency consultants when necessary to inform the design, strategy, and implementation of the planned digital equity trading platform (“BDTP”). Currently, Artuova software engineer Dr. David Gnabasik is providing the expertise needed to develop the hyperledger-fabric blockchain solution for CEMC. Dr. Gnabasik holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Denver.
Regulatory Challenges – BlackStar has always recognized that crypto equities must be registered within the existing SEC regulations and guidelines. BlackStar’s aim is to develop BDTP, a digital shares trading platform, to trade registered BlackStar digital shares only. The regulatory challenges presented come from integration of the existing broker-dealer ecosystem into the platform, approvals/advice of and compliance with the rules and regulations of the OTC Market Group, SEC, FinCen, IRS, CFTC, anti-money laundering rules, and FINRA for the functionality of the system, cybersecurity laws, and other state and federal financial and banking laws. Until the implementation of the BDTP as designed, BlackStar digital shares (encrypted DWAC common shares) will be traded through the existing Market Makers system.
 
Our Company has examined numerous “exchanges” or “platforms” for trading including Aphelion, tZero, and others and found them lacking essential regulatory compliance practices. This research and management’s securities and compliance background lead the Company to engage a team of software experts at Artuova to create the platform that is being designed to contain the essentials for full regulatory compliance including:
 
• Know-Your-Customer (KYC)
 • Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
 • IRS tax reporting
 • SEC compliance
 • Exchange registration (ATS)
 
CEMC intends to engage further software developers as needed for blockchain implementation on the Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) BDTP platform. CEMC intends to integrate BDTP with the existing FINRA and SEC regulated brokerage ecosystem in order to trade BlackStar digital shares, addressing many of the regulatory issues by operating within the existing confines of the system. The intent of BDTP is to replace the market-makers in the brokerage ecosystem. As intended, the system would operate in the following manner: broker-dealers would invite customers to participate as users on the BDTP to buy and sell BlackStar equity trades; the broker-dealers comply with all FinCen and Exchange regulations, KYC and FinCen rules, submit IRS tax reports, etc.; orders, bids, and offers are entered into the BDTP (like a specialist’s order book) either by broker-dealers or Users through trading software supplied by the broker-dealers; BDTP records all transactions; and finally, OTC Market Group and the SEC/FINRA have complete and transparent access to the data stored in BDTP, offering FINRA and the likes a single data interface and consolidated history of transactions. BDTP seamlessly integrates with the order entry processes, priority rules, and execution procedures of the existing brokerage ecosystem. Although not a profit center, BlackStar intends to charge a $0.99 cent fee per executed trade to cover expenses, and broker-dealers would recover the fee. CEMC plans to implement the technology based upon the hyperledger-fabric, an open-source blockchain framework from IBM, and to use the IBM Cloud for transaction data storage. BDTP would offer a web-based interface for trading transactions as well as an Application Programming Interface (API) that directly accesses all immutable transactions stored on BDTP. The participating members on the platform would be buying and selling broker-dealers, OTC Market Group, FINRA, SEC, DTCC, and Clearing House. FINRA and the SEC would serve as Certificate Authorities in the BDTP

-

permissioned blockchain, restricting the actors who can contribute to the consensus of the system state – only a restricted set of users would be enabled to have the rights to write or validate the block transactions. The distributed consensus process satisfies the following purposes: 1) permissioned clients are voted into the network by all existing validators; 2) the process helps to keep inaccurate or potentially fraudulent transactions out of the database through a chosen computational mechanism; and 3) all relevant network participants agree that a transaction is valid through the use of a multi-signature consensus algorithm where a majority of validators must agree that a specific transaction or transaction class is valid. BlackStar and CEMC hope to build and implement BDTP over the next six months, pending comments/approval by various regulatory agencies. BlackStar and CEMC would operate and manage the platform and remain responsible for the functionality and security of the platform.
 
Neither CEMC nor BlackStar intend to underwrite these entities or entrepreneurial companies, nor do they intend to act as a broker-dealer or investment company, though we acknowledge the potential requirements to register as such or to claim exemption from registration.
 
We understand that we may be required to register as an ATS. Alternatively, we may seek an exemption if we are able to establish a relationship with OTC Market Group to quote our stock on the OTCQB page alongside the Market Makers. We plan to trade only registered shares of BEGI on a blockchain platform, and have the SEC, FINRA and BlackStar deemed the Certificate Authority on the blockchain trading platform once implemented.
 
Volatility of Cryptocurrencies and Tax Implications – Neither BlackStar nor CEMC will be trading in, accepting loan repayments in, or making loans in cryptocurrencies; the intent is to build a P2P platform on which to trade registered digital securities of BlackStar.
 
Cybersecurity Implications of DLT – Transactions on the distributed ledger fabric are protected by public-key X.509 certificates. The protection of PII data is the responsibility of each brokerage dealer. Any blockchain code used will be placed in a public repository after having been certified by an independent cybersecurity audit. Further, CEMC bases the operational requirements and cyber-security framework in part on the following publications the “Distributed Ledger Technology: Implications of Blockchain for the Securities Industry” published by FINRA, and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) report entitled “Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity.”
 
IHG, our parent company, also may enter into management consulting agreements with companies for which BlackStar provides funding to attempt to guide the companies in the complex business world for the purpose of protecting and enhancing the venture investments made by BlackStar.
 
SERVICES
 
Crypto Equity Management Corp. is a recently formed subsidiary of BlackStar and has no operating history or assets to date. CEMC is authorized to issue 999,999,999 shares of common stock and 99,999,999 shares of preferred stock. At organization, BlackStar received 1,000 shares of common stock for formation services and is the only shareholder.
 
As BlackStar focuses its merchant banking efforts on the crypto-equity and DLT industry, BlackStar intends to seek investments through joint ventures in private or public emerging commercial-stage businesses within the blockchain ecosystem. BlackStar also intends to offer consulting and compliance services to member crypto companies and blockchain entrepreneurs on securities and commodity futures.
 
The Company will seek targeted joint ventures in the sector, primarily focusing on distributed ledger security features and technology, and the peer-to-peer (P2P) global equity trading arena. BlackStar, through CEMC, will initially control and manage each venture into which it enters. While remaining compliant with current SEC

disclosure and reporting guidelines, BlackStar is conducting an in-depth analysis into the Company’s involvement in crypto-equity and DLT related ventures.
 
In addition to the services described above, BlackStar Enterprise formed a subsidiary nonprofit company, Crypto Industry SRO Inc., on December 31, 2017. Crypto Industry SRO is in the beginning stages of organizing membership participation in the newly-formed nonprofit. Crypto Industry SRO is planned to act as a self-regulatory membership organization for the crypto-equity industry and set guidelines and best-practice rules by which industry members would abide. BlackStar will provide management of this entity under a services contract.
 
BlackStar Enterprise Group intends to leverage its experience in the traditional world of public finance, including experience with securities, options, and SEC registration and compliance, into working with select organizations supporting the development and implementation of new technologies in the crypto-equity and DLT world. To facilitate this process, BlackStar plans to establish an advisory board in its subsidiary, Crypto Industry SRO Inc., with applicable technical and practical experience.
 
The Company’s success will be dependent upon the Company’s ability to analyze and manage the opportunities presented.
 
BlackStar’s Operating Principles:
 

· | Provide alternative joint venture funding for entrepreneurs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require GAAP and SEC accounting compliance for portfolio ventures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Require competent and efficient legal representation;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Require qualified managers for portfolio ventures, and in some cases, help staff the client company while avoiding recruiting costs or attempts to bring in high-price executives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We seek venture investments in private, or public emerging commercial-stage businesses with perceived strong growth prospects within certain industry sectors. Companies that we work with may engage in consulting agreements with our parent company, International Hedge Group, Inc. (“IHG”), to add additional monitoring as to their financial situations. We seek to invest up to $1 million per company in business ventures. We may provide off-balance sheet financing to venture companies, through joint ventures or limited liability companies under structures we cannot now predict.
 
Our success will be dependent upon are our abilities to analyze and manage the lending opportunities presented to us.
 
Our management may earn shares of our Company under our Stock Option and Award Plan as incentives on the basis of achievement. All are accountable to each other, as well as the shareholders, and bonus awards are intended based upon individual performance, as well as team cooperation, and enterprise building.
 
 INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
 
CAPITAL APPRECIATION. Our primary investment objective is to provide our shareholders with long term capital appreciation by investing primarily in business ventures in which we maintain majority control with selective private companies.  We believe that a typical new business venture will have a five-year window. Our investment objective is to restrict our investments to emerging growth companies we believe offer special opportunities and meet our growth criteria, and we intend to reduce the risks associated with investments in startups. Our goal is to provide mezzanine and expansion capital to companies through legally formed joint venture entities through which we control in order to develop a comprehensive growth strategy, possibly involving a consolidation of similarly situated businesses or a geographic expansion of existing product or service offerings. We are currently exploring options for investments in companies involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain (DLT) technology industry.
 
CAPITAL PRESERVATION. A second investment objective is to preserve investor capital through risk management and monitoring the management of our loan portfolio. Among the risk management techniques which we expect to employ are: (i) limiting our investments in very early stage companies, (ii) holding majority ventures interests in venture companies that have a positive cash flow; (iii) co-investing in venture companies with other

professional venture capital. Many ventures will not provide any gain, and some will be complete losses. BlackStar, through CEMC, will initially control and manage each venture it enters into in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industry.
 
OUR APPROACH COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF VENTURE FINANCING
 
Emerging companies traditionally seek financing for growth from three primary sources: small private placements, independent private venture capital funds and corporate strategic investors. Each of these sources has advantages but also notable disadvantages for the emerging company. Small Private Placements are often underfunded and untimely. Venture capital funds generally are established for a limited term and their primary goal is to maximize their financial return within a short time frame, often two years or less with severe terms for extensions or additional funding.  A venture capital fund often seeks to liquidate its investment in the emerging company by encouraging either an early initial public offering or a sale. This often can jeopardize an emerging company's chances for success especially if its business has not been fully developed or its intellectual property fully safeguarded prior to its debut into the market.
 
Corporate strategic investors are typically large corporations that invest in emerging companies to gain access to a promising product or technology without incurring the initial cost of development or the diversion of managerial time and attention necessary to develop new products or technologies. Often these investments involve both financing support to the emerging company and an arrangement under which the strategic investor obtains the right to use, and intellectual property ownership of, the products or technology of the emerging company. While strategic investors are generally able to provide business development support, the rationale behind the investment of a strategic investor may be incompatible with the development of the emerging company. Strategic investors often discourage the emerging company from becoming a public company, selling to competitors of the strategic investor or from retaining the intellectual property rights to products developed jointly with the strategic investor.
 
We may be limited in our ability to fund ventures because we may not be successful in raising additional funds to fund ventures or growth.  Through the public market for our common stock, we hope to have access to additional equity capital that may be needed for growing our ventures. We hope to offer to fill this opportunity on selected ventures.
 
We believe that our advantage over a strategic investor is that our interests are more closely aligned with those of the emerging company. An initial public offering of the emerging company, our venture, often required to raise the additional capital investment necessary to fully develop a venture company's product or technology, would also benefit us by creating repayment of our loan, and possibly in certain instances, an equity position.
 
OUR VENTURE POLICIES
 
We may invest in ventures which do not have any annual revenue, if we have determined that an investment may make of such company have growth capital.
 
Although we may seek to venture into companies with existing positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization), we may also consider turn around situations where we can clearly identify the source(s) of financial distress and see a possible solution. Through our investment, or through co-investment with other private equity funding sources we will seek to achieve performance improvements.
 
In the shorter term, we do not anticipate paying any dividends or making other distributions, but this may change in the future. We may not always achieve a return on our venture investment.
 
In selecting venture investments for our venture, we will endeavor to meet our guidelines, as established by our Board which include the following concepts. We may, however, make investments that do not conform to one or more of these guidelines when deemed appropriate by our Board of Directors. Such investments might be made if we believe that a failure to conform in one area is offset by exceptional strength in another or is compensated for by a higher yield, favorable warrant issuance or other attractive terms or features.

VENTURE CRITERIA
 
STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA. We are a special situations Company. We will primarily look for opportunities with a core business which we believe will provide us with a return of investment and on investment within a moderate period of time, typically targeting about thirty-six to sixty months. Our objective is to invest in emerging corporations which meet our requirements as well as qualitative potential that we look for in each opportunity. In addition, we will look to invest in ventures with corporations. In some instances, we may relax our quantitative requirements with the view to assist such venture companies in developing a strategic business plan which may include merger or acquisition of other private operating businesses which may be synergistic to the existing business of the public corporation. We may invest in ventures with companies in any of the following stages. We will always have majority control and Board control of our venture subsidiaries.
 
The stages of development are defined as follows:
 

Seed capital companies represent the earliest
stage of development. These companies have raised relatively modest equity capital to prove a concept and qualify for start-up
capital. Their activities generally are limited to product development, scientific and market research, recruiting a management
team and developing a business plan. These companies likely do not have financial support from either venture capitalists or larger
companies making strategic investments.


Start-up stage companies are completing or
have recently completed product development and initial marketing but have not sold their products commercially. Generally, such
firms have made market studies, assembled key management, developed a business plan and are ready to commence operations.


Expansion stage companies have initiated or
are about to initiate full-scale operations and sales but may not be showing a profit.


Mezzanine stage companies are approaching
or have attained break even or profitability and are continuing to expand. An acquisition or initial public offering may be imminent.

 
QUALITATIVE CRITERIA. All potential ventures will first be evaluated and assessed based on their relative stage of development and the quality of an investment in such venture company based on the above criteria. Once our management team has determined that a potential venture satisfies the above criteria and is suitable for investment, it will then be evaluated using the multi-step process described below. After completion of the process, receipt and review of all internal and outside reports and evaluations of the potential venture company, the Board will consider the potential venture terms. If the Board approves the investment, we will then create appropriate legal documents to reflect our venture and any management service contracts between the venture and our company.
 
We intend to follow the steps set forth below in our venture process:
 
(1) BUSINESS PLAN/ASSESSMENT. Business plan description and complete resumes of management from all entrepreneurs. Members of our management team will meet with the best of these entrepreneurs, attempting to identify key traits that have been associated with entrepreneurial success in the past, such as high energy, a must-win attitude, intellectual brilliance, high personal integrity, relevant experience, a strong work ethic, and the ability to prioritize and focus. A business plan submitted for evaluation to us should contain the following information:
 

· | Overview of the business concept as well as the company's strategic focus and direction.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Discussion of competition including a discussion of specialized expertise, intellectual property, patents, and/or other unique advantages held by either the company or its competitors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sources and uses of cash with respect to investment capital sought.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


11
--


· | Pro forma financial projections for at least the current year and two subsequent years including expected capital requirements from the time of the investment capital received through the two subsequent years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Operating plan including current and projected staffing, equipment, and space requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Discussion of minimum dollar proceeds necessary in order to implement the business plan.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Marketing plan.
--+----------------


· | Discussion of conflicts of interest with investors together with steps being taken by the venture company to mitigate such conflicts of interest and to protect against future conflicts of interest.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Resumes for all key officers/managers.
--+---------------------------------------

 
(2) EVALUATE POTENTIAL MARKET. We have developed relationships with consultants, who represent a valuable source of information about a target investment's market. We will call upon these contacts as well as create new ones in the markets of each company seeking funding. As we evaluate markets, we must become confident that the company can attain a competitive market position over time.
 
(3) EXAMINE STRUCTURE OF BUSINESS MODEL. We will examine the structure upon which the business plan is built. The Board has indicated a distinct bias toward business models calling for high gross margins and relatively low capital intensiveness. Such businesses have the potential for higher internally sustainable growth rates than average and superior return on equity invested. In addition, we will require, whenever possible, implementation of the following policies into the articles, bylaws or operating agreements of its venture companies:
 

· | There can be only one class of common shares, all with equal voting rights, and all distributions of capital or earnings can only be made to all members based upon their percentage interest without preference;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compensation of the key officers/managers and their affiliates, including, but not limited to, all salary, bonuses, commissions and/or fees, shall be limited based upon the success of the venture company in reaching predetermined milestones; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The primary responsibility of the management/officers of the entity is to serve as fiduciaries charged with serving the best interests of the stockholders/members even when such interests may be in conflict with the management, officers or other employees of the entity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
(4) CHECK REFERENCES. We will require that each entrepreneur supply a list of references in order that we may get a better sense of the entrepreneur's past experience, strengths, weaknesses, and work habits. We make it a point to get references outside of this list as well, in order to avoid only "cherry-picked references." We believe that these checks are important to develop a more complete and accurate picture of the team.
 
(5) CALL CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. We intend to call a number of current and/or prospective customers and suppliers to get a sense of how they view the targeted investment including its products and the market.
 
(6) EVALUATE PRODUCTS/TECHNOLOGY. As part of our analysis, we will evaluate the target venture’s current products, development pipeline and underlying technology. To evaluate technology, we will not rely on in-house expertise alone, but will contact and hire appropriate specialists and consultants.
 
(7) EVALUATE RISKS/REWARDS. Evaluate the pro-forma financials, the likelihood of an exit after a 6 month to 24 month holding period.

(8) NEGOTIATE VENTURE TERMS. When deciding on making a venture investment, we will draw up a term sheet for negotiation, and terms will be agreed upon.
 
(9) FINANCIALS AND CORPORATE INFORMATION.
 
We will, after formation of the venture subsidiary, control all accounting and financials as a subsidiary of our Company.  
 
RESERVES. We intend to retain reserves after the venture investment in order to have sufficient funds for equity-oriented follow-on investments in venture companies. We intend to sell additional common stock to meet the funding requirements for any follow-on venture investments. If such sales are successful, we expect to have cash reserves. In order to enhance the rate of return on these reserves and increase the amounts ultimately available for investments and our operating costs, we plan to engage in a reserve management strategy.
 
AVERAGE INVESTMENT. The amount of funds committed to a venture will vary depending on the funds available to us, the quality and completeness of the venture management team, the perceived business opportunity, the capital required compared to existing capital, and the potential return. Although the venture or investment amounts will vary considerably, we expect that the venture (excluding follow-on investments) will be between $250,000 and $500,000.
 
INDUSTRY ANALYSIS AND HISTORY
 
Barriers to Entry in the Merchant Banking Industry
 
There is one major barrier to entry into the Merchant Banking Industry which is capital. We have very limited capital with which to compete in this industry. Many other competitors have been in the business for many years and have very large capital resources and an established reputation. Our barriers to entry are, in addition to lack of capital, lack of reputation, lack of recognition, part-time management, lack of financial history to raise money, and lack of equity in our company upon which to base a capital raise.
 
Competitive Factors impacting our ability to gain market share
 
Our competition enjoys advantages which may prevent us from achieving a market share due to our competitors’ known reputations, large funding abilities, competent management, and capital resources all of which will impede our abilities to achieve market share.
 
Competitive Factors in the Industry
 
There are numerous entities, Investments banks, merchant banks, hedge funds, private equity, commercial banks and private investors which will compete for the same business in which we intend to engage. We will be at a significant disadvantage to all of these other competitors for the foreseeable future. All of our competitors should be considered to be far better capitalized than we are.
 
Registrant’s Competitive position in the Industry
 
Registrant is an insignificant participant in the merchant banking industry and cannot be expected to obtain a market share even discernable percentage wise. Without a large infusion of capital, it will remain a very small participant in the industry.
 
Merchant Banking 
 
The term merchant banking is generally understood to mean negotiated private equity investment or financing through alternative methods by financial institutions in loans, convertible debt or off-balance sheet vehicles, or through unregistered securities of either privately or publicly held companies. Both investment banks, commercial banks, and other companies engage in merchant banking, and the type of security in which they invest is diverse.

13
--

They may invest in securities with an equity participation feature; these may be convertible preferred stock or subordinated debt with conversion privileges or warrants. Other investment bank services include raising capital from outside sources, advising on mergers and acquisitions, and providing bridge loans while bond financing is being raised in a leveraged buyout (LBO) and are also typically offered by financial institutions or broker dealers engaged in the merchant bank industry. One which is often omitted is the provision of experienced management by the merchant to commercialize ideas, or technology.
 
Merchant banking has been an occasionally lucrative but a highly risky endeavor for the small number of bank holding companies and banks that have engaged in it under existing law, and for private equity investors. Banking law legislation has expanded the merchant-banking activity that is permissible to commercial banks and has spurred interest in this specialty on the part of some institutions. However, limitations exist that have scared many banks away from the markets after the Lehman collapse and the resulting fallout with JP Morgan, Bank of America and the big bank Wall Street bailout. Although for much of the past half-century commercial banks have been permitted (subject to certain restrictions) to engage in merchant banking activities, their continued role is limited by the conservatism of the regulators and their Boards.
 
Evolution of Modern Era Merchant Banking
 
Many banks entered merchant banking in the 1960s to take advantage of the economies of scope produced when private equity investing is added to other bank services, particularly commercial lending. As lenders to small and medium-sized companies, banks become knowledgeable about individual firms' products and prospects and consequently are natural providers of direct private equity investment to these firms.
 
In the middle to late 1980s, the decision to enter merchant banking was thrust on other banks and bank holding companies by unforeseen events. In those years, as a result of the LDC (less-developed-country) debt crisis, many banks received private equity from developing nations in return for their defaulted loans. At that time, many of these banks set up merchant-banking subsidiaries to try to extract some value from this private equity.
 
Also, at about that time, most commercial banks began refocusing their private equity investments to middle-market and public companies (often low-tech, already profitable companies) and, rather than providing seed capital, financed expansion or changes in capital structure and ownership. Most particularly, they took equity positions in LBOs, takeovers, or recapitalizations or provided subordinated debt in the form of bridge loans to facilitate the transaction. Often, they did both. Commercial banks financed much of the LBO activity of the 1980s.
 
Then, in the mid-1990s, major commercial banks began once again focusing on venture capital, where they had substantial expertise from their previous exposure to this kind of investment. Some of these recent venture-capital investments have been spectacularly successful. For example, the Internet search engine Lycos was a 1998 investment of Chase Manhattan's venture-capital arm.
 
We do not compete in the area of these merchant banks, or even large or mid-market banks. We are an insignificant participant in the total market and our focus is on small investments, which larger banks may rule out.
 
Historical Track Records
 
Our Company has no historical track record and we should be deemed a pure start-up of earning or operating with all of the risks of an unproven company (see “Risk Factors”).
COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
 
Competition
 
There are a large number of companies and individuals engaged in the Merchant Banking and Finance industry; accordingly, there is a high degree of competition. Almost all of the companies and individuals so engaged have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we do.

14
--

We are an insignificant participant among the firms which engage in the funding of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
 
Investment Company Act 1940
 
Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities within the definitions and parameters which would make us subject to the “1940 Act.” In the event we engage in business activities that result in us holding investment interests in a number of entities, we might become subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an Investment Company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. Under no circumstances does the company intend to become an investment company and its activities and its financial statement ratios of assets and cash will be carefully monitored and other activities reviewed by the Board to prevent being classified or inadvertently becoming an investment company which would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
As a fundamental concept, the 1940 Act requires registration of companies that invest and manage funds to invest for others and trade in securities of other companies. Those companies that cross a threshold of 40% of assets in cash and stock in other companies may be required to register. Investment companies may issue face amount certificates, be a Unit Investment Trust, or be a mutual fund. We intend to do several things to remain outside of the 1940 Act: a) we will not trade in securities of other companies or manage investments for others, b) we intend to remain primarily in the merchant bank lending business recognized as exempt under Sections 3(c)(4) and (5) of the 1940 Act, c) we intend to carefully monitor our ratios of cash and securities to total assets to avoid crossing the 1940 Act threshold, d) we intend to hold loans comprising 60% to 70% of our assets at any time, e) we intend to maintain secured loans to companies as our primary business, f) we do not intend to issue face amount certificates, g) we do not intend to distribute profits and dividends to our shareholders on an annual or shorter basis, if ever, h) we do not pass through profits and losses to our shareholders on a tax basis, i) smaller secured loans will be our primary business and our primary profit center, which we intend will account for more than 50% of our revenues; j) we will not issue Units in investment trusts, k) we will not act as a mutual fund, and l) we will not invest funds on behalf of others.
 
We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3(c)(4) and (5) of the 1940 Act.
 
Markets.
 
Our market is highly competitive and constantly changing. Commercial success is frequently dependent on capital availability, the effectiveness and sufficiency of which are very difficult to predict accurately. It is one of the principal economic risks of mezzanine and expansion stage funding companies like ours.
Federal Regulations.
 
Governmental Regulation.
 
We are subject to regulations by securities laws as a public company. We do not intend to become an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, but if we exceed certain thresholds of certain assets or our business operations cease to fall within certain exemptions, we might inadvertently become subject to the Act.
Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations.
 
Certain states may require that we obtain a Lender’s License prior to making a loan in that state. We intend to address this on an as needed basis.

16
--

Based on our current cash reserves of approximately $6,319 as of December 31, 2018, we have the cash for an operational budget of less than three months.  We intend to offer a private placement of digital shares to investors in order to achieve at least $1,300,000 in funding in the next year. We intend to commence this offering in late Spring of 2019. If we are unable to generate enough revenue, to cover our operational costs, we will need to seek additional sources of funds. Currently, we have no committed source for any funds as of date hereof. No representation is made that any funds will be available when needed. In the event funds cannot be raised if and when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan and could fail in business as a result of these uncertainties.
 
The independent registered public accounting firm’s report on our financial statements as of December 31, 2018, includes a “going concern” explanatory paragraph that describes substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
While our cash reserves were only $6,319 in December 2018, our parent company, IHG, has agreed to fund on an interim basis any shortfall in our cash reserves. We would use our funds to pay legal, accounting, office rent and general and administrative expense. We have estimated $50,000 per quarter in 2019 in operations costs which includes legal, accounting, travel, general and administrative, audit, rent, telephones and miscellaneous, with $150,000 budgeted for the first quarter of 2019 for additional legal and regulatory filings as needed. In early 2018, we completed a private placement of units for $165,000, and in November 2018 we raised $53,000 through a convertible promissory note which increased our working capital.
 
We received the funding to loan the monies to our first borrower company, Meshworks Media Corporation, from our parent, IHG, in the form of two loans to BlackStar for a total of $500,000. The notes were three-year notes payable at 6% interest per year. Further details of the Meshworks notes are below.
 
MATERIAL TERMS OF OUR LOANS TO MESHWORKS MEDIA CORPORATION
 
Meshworks Media Corporation (“Meshworks”) borrowed $250,000 from BlackStar Enterprise Group, Inc. on November 1, 2016, bearing Interest at the annual rate of 12 % and a second loan was made for $250,000 in January 2017, with the following material terms:
 
1. Payment. Commencing January 2, 2017, the venture shall issue payments to the lender(s) equal to 15% of the previous months’ revenue and said revenue payments, of principal and interest, shall continue thereafter, to be issued on the first day of each month, until the principal and interest have been paid in full to the lender(s) but in no case, later than January 1, 2019 (“Maturity Date”) when any unpaid principle and interest shall be due in full.
 
2. Security. The Note is secured to us by a security agreement covering all of Meshworks' assets and revenues.
 
3. Additional Consideration. We received, as additional consideration, 2 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred stock (Series B Stock) for each one dollar ($1.00) loaned to Meshworks. After repayment of the loan but no later than February 1, 2019 the Series B Stock, which we own is to receive dividends from profit based on 15% of the previous months’ revenue which will continue until such time as we have received distributions equal to the full amount of the loan. At that point, the Series B Preferred shall automatically convert to common stock of Meshworks at the rate of one share of common for each share of preferred converted. Until such time as all dividends have been paid, Meshworks shall not pay any dividends to or on its outstanding common stock.
 
Our Meshworks loan met our lending criteria as follows:
 
1. Meshworks had spent over $1,000,000 in investment in its software.
 2. Meshworks had generated over $800,000 in income in prior years.
 3. Meshworks has a software product that appears to be at the forefront to serve the real estate industry, with potential for a) repayment of the loan, and b) potential for equity participation in the venture.

Update to the Meshworks Loan:
 
On September 27, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement to Settle Debt with International Hedge Group, Inc. (“IHG”). the majority stockholder of the Company. Under the agreement, IHG agreed to compromise and settle

the Principal Amount under the verbal working capital loan agreement of BEGI, as of November 2016, in the amount of $400,000, by assignment, without recourse, of the MeshWorks Media Corp, Promissory Notes together with all collateral agreements. Upon signing of the agreement, a promissory note was delivered for the difference from IHG to BEGI in the amount of $145,000 for BEGI return of principal of $100,000 and all of the accrued interest to date under the MeshWorks Media Corp. notes, payable in twelve-month with interest of 1% per quarter on the last day of each quarter until paid. The assignment of the MeshWorks Media Corp. Promissory Note and the note from IHG to BEGI in the amount of $145,000 is full and complete payment and consideration for the transaction referenced hereinabove. A copy of the agreement is available by accessing the Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov) on September 27, 2017.
 
As a result of our Agreement to settle debt we no longer have any loans to companies and we do not intend to make loans in the future. Under our revised business plan, we will control all of our business ventures until divestiture, spin-off, or liquidation.
 
REPORTS TO SECURITIES HOLDERS
 
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, (“SEC”), at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
