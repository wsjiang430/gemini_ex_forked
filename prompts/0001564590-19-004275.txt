 Atara’s most advanced T-cell immunotherapy, tab-cel® (tabelecleucel), is in Phase 3 development for patients with Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, or EBV+ PTLD, who have failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy, as well as other EBV-associated hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or NPC. Atara is also developing T-cell immunotherapies targeting EBV antigens believed to be important for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS (ATA188 and ATA190). Atara’s pipeline also includes next-generation CAR T immunotherapies for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, autoimmune and viral diseases, including ATA2271 targeting mesothelin, ATA2321 for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and ATA2431 and ATA3219 for patients with B-cell lymphomas.  In addition to these core programs, we also have a diverse pipeline of other programs including ATA621 directed against the BK and JC viruses, ATA368 for patients with human papillomavirus, or HPV, associated cancers, ATA520 for patients with Wilms Tumor 1, or WT1, associated cancers and ATA230 directed against cytomegalovirus, or CMV, related diseases. 
 In June 2018, we opened our dedicated and expandable Atara T-Cell Operations and Manufacturing facility, or ATOM, in Thousand Oaks, California.  ATOM has the flexibility to produce multiple T-cell and CAR T immunotherapies and integrates research and process science to enable rapid development.  The research and development and process and analytical development labs at ATOM are operationally supporting preclinical development activities. ATOM is designed to global regulatory standards, and the commissioning and qualification activities required to support ATOM manufacturing capacity to support clinical production are expected to be completed in 2019.

Our Technology and Pipeline
 Our pipeline is summarized below: 

Technology Overview
 Our off-the-shelf, allogeneic T-cell platform allows for rapid delivery of a T-cell immunotherapy product that has been manufactured in advance and stored in inventory, with each manufactured lot of cells providing therapy for numerous potential patients. This differs from autologous treatments, in which each patient’s own cells must be extracted, modified outside the body and then delivered back to the patient. We utilize a proprietary cell selection algorithm to select the appropriate set of cells for use based on a patient’s unique immune profile. This matching process is designed to allow us to eliminate pre-treatment before our cells are administered and to reduce monitoring following administration. For example, in our ongoing studies, patients are monitored for one to two hours following receipt of tab-cel®. 
 Our T-cell immunotherapy platform is applicable to a broad array of targets and diseases. With more than 200 patients treated across the platform, we have observed clinical proof of concept across both viral and non-viral targets in conditions ranging from hematological malignancies and solid tumors to infectious and autoimmune diseases. We have also observed a safety profile characterized by few treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, positive long-term outcomes including durable remissions, and no evidence of cytokine release syndrome to date. 
 Our allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy product candidates are bioengineered from cells donated by healthy individuals with normal immune function. Once cells are collected from a donor, they are bioengineered to recognize the antigens of interest and then expanded in number. The resulting expanded T-cells are then characterized and held as inventory. From inventory, these cells can be selected, distributed and prepared for infusion in a partially human leukocyte antigen-, or HLA-, matched patient within approximately three days. Following administration, our T cells are designed to home to their target, undergo target-dependent proliferation, eliminate diseased cells and eventually recede. Target-dependent proliferation means that our T cells expand in number when they encounter diseased cells in a patient’s body that express the antigen the cells are designed to recognize.  Our existing allogeneic process and know-how allow for minimal cell manipulation (single versus multiple genetic manipulations) which we believe will enable us to develop a new generation CAR T construct that includes multiple chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, per cell and CAR designs that will enhance persistence and efficacy.
We recognize that our clinical studies may not be available to all patients and we have established expanded access and compassionate use programs in instances where there is a significant patient need.

Tab-cel® for EBV+ PTLD Following HCT or SOT
 Since its discovery as the first human oncovirus, EBV has been implicated in the development of a wide range of diseases, including lymphomas and other cancers. EBV is widespread in human populations and persists as a lifelong, asymptomatic infection. In healthy individuals, a small
 percentage of T-cells are devoted to keeping EBV in check. In contrast, immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplants, or 
HCT, 
or solid organ transplants, or SOT, have a reduced ability to control EBV. Left without appropriate immune surveillance, EBV transformed cells can, in some patients, proliferate and cause an aggressive, life-threatening cancer called EBV+ PTLD. Nearly all cases of PTLD that occur following HCT are EBV positive while approximately 70% of PTLD cases that occur following SOT are EBV positive. Approximately 10-15% of PTLD patients are children. Historical studies suggest a high unmet medical need for improved therapies in patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy, with approximately 40 to 60% of patients either not responding to or progressing following this first line of therapy. Expected median overall survival in patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab-based first line therapy is between 16 and 56 days, with a one-year survival rate of approximately 23% based on our evaluation of available historical outcomes data. Estimated one- and two-year survival following incomplete response to rituximab in patients with high-risk EBV+ PTLD after SOT is 36% and 0%, respectively. The use of chemotherapy in patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab is frequently associated with significant rates of treatment-related mortality due to the frailty of the patients and severe toxicities associated with chemotherapy.
 We licensed certain patent rights, know-how and a library of T cells and cell lines specific to EBV, CMV and WT1 from MSK in June 2015 in an agreement we refer to as the 2015 MSK License Agreement.  In the 2015 MSK License Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products and to make milestone payments with respect to the licensed programs and to make royalty payments to MSK to the extent product candidates arising from the collaboration are commercialized. Our most advanced product candidate, tab-cel®, is part of this MSK collaboration and targets EBV.
 Tab-cel®, is an allogeneic EBV-specific T-cell immunotherapy that is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD who have failed rituximab or rituximab plus chemotherapy. Tab-cel® received Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT who have failed rituximab, Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the same indication, and orphan designation in the U.S. and European Union for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT or SOT. In December 2016, we announced that we had reached agreement with the FDA on the designs of two Phase 3 studies for tab-cel® intended to support approval in two separate indications, the treatment of EBV+ PTLD following HCT (which we refer to as the MATCH study) and SOT in patients who have failed rituximab (which we refer to as the ALLELE study). In December 2017, following discussion with the FDA of manufacturing and comparability data generated on material manufactured by our contract manufacturing organization, we initiated these studies in the U.S. We expect to expand these studies geographically to include clinical sites outside the U.S. Discussions with the FDA regarding the development of tab‑cel® are ongoing and our intention is to reach alignment on a global regulatory strategy for patients with EBV+ PTLD. Outcomes of these discussions are expected in the first half of 2019. 
The Phase 3 MATCH study is a multicenter, open label, single arm study currently designed to enroll approximately 35 patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab. The Phase 3 ALLELE study is a multicenter, open label study currently designed with two non-comparative cohorts of approximately 35 patients each. The first cohort includes patients who previously received rituximab monotherapy, and the second cohort includes patients who previously received rituximab plus chemotherapy. Both cohorts are enrolling concurrently. The primary endpoint of both the MATCH and ALLELE studies is confirmed best objective response rate, or ORR, defined as the percent of patients achieving either a complete or partial response to treatment with tab-cel® confirmed after the initial tumor assessment showing a response. The current protocols are designed to rule out a 20% ORR as the null hypothesis. This means that if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval on ORR among patients receiving at least one dose of tab-cel® exceeds 20% at the end of the study, then the study would be expected to meet the primary endpoint for the treatment of PTLD. For example, assuming enrollment of 35 patients in MATCH, an observed ORR above approximately 37% would be expected to meet the primary endpoint. ALLELE is currently designed such that each of the two cohorts will be analyzed separately with respect to the primary endpoint and, as an example, with 35 patients enrolled in either cohort, an observed ORR above approximately 37% would be expected to meet the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints for both studies include duration of response, overall survival, safety, quality of life metrics, and other measures to evaluate its health economic impact. 
 In clinical studies conducted at MSK that have enrolled patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT and SOT, efficacy following treatment with tab-cel® monotherapy compared favorably with historical data in these patient populations. Patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT who have failed rituximab and were treated with tab-cel® had one-year overall survival of approximately 70% in two separate clinical studies. In the setting of EBV+ PTLD after SOT in patients who have failed rituximab, similar results were observed, with one-year overall survival of approximately 60% in tab-cel®-treated patients. A response rate of greater than or equal to 50% was observed in HCT and SOT patients in these studies.

We are also pursuing marketing approval of tab-cel® in the European Union. The EMA issued a positive opinion for orphan drug designation for tab-cel® for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD and granted tab-cel® access to the EMA’s PRIME regulatory initiative for the treatment of patients with EBV+ PTLD following HCT who have failed rituximab. PRIME provides early enhanced regulatory support to facilitate regulatory applications and accelerate the review of medicines that address a high unmet need. Discussions with the EMA regarding the development of tab‑cel® are ongoing and our intention is to reach alignment on a global regulatory strategy for patients with EBV+ PTLD. Outcomes of these discussions are expected in the first half of 2019. We plan to submit a tab‑cel® EU conditional marketing authorization, or CMA, application in the second half of 2019. 
We anticipate that initial tab‑cel® Phase 3 results to be available to the company in the first half of 2019. To ensure the integrity of the ongoing, open-label tab-cel® Phase 3 studies, we anticipate disclosing initial top-line EBV+ PTLD results in the second half of 2019 following submission of the EMA CMA application.
 We are continuing our preparations to support the planned commercialization of tab-cel®. This includes the development of a proprietary, web-based, off-the-shelf delivery solution for commercial use that we call Atara MatchMe™. The Atara MatchMe™ system will be a portal for health care professionals and institutions that allows for order input, including the provision of required patient HLA and other information, the execution of our cell selection algorithm, product shipment and tracking and the capture of data on outcomes following treatment. We expect to pursue approvals in key geographies, including the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia and may seek partners to aid in our commercialization efforts in select markets. In addition, we expect to pursue development of tab-cel® in earlier lines of therapy as well as in other EBV-associated diseases and malignancies. 
 We maintain a multicenter expanded access protocol, or EAP. The primary objective of this program is to provide tab-cel® monotherapy to patients with EBV-associated diseases or certain EBV+ malignancies for whom there are no other therapeutic options. Key secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy and safety through a robust collection of data. 
 Tab-cel® for NPC 
 NPC is a type of head and neck cancer that is primarily associated with EBV. Standard treatment for NPC typically includes radiation therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy or a combination of both. Surgical intervention is only rarely employed and is usually only utilized in select early stage cases. There are no approved therapeutic agents available to treat relapsed/refractory NPC, although there are multiple agents in development for this patient population. In April 2017, we entered into an agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme (known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada) to provide drug supply for a study to be sponsored and conducted by us to evaluate tab-cel® in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with platinum-resistant or recurrent EBV-associated NPC. This Phase 1/2 study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the combination and was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2018.
ATA188 and ATA190 for Multiple Sclerosis
 MS is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system, or CNS, that disrupts the myelination and normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. The evolution of MS results in an increasing loss of both physical and cognitive (e.g., memory) function. This has a substantial negative impact on the more-than two million people worldwide affected by MS, with approximately 800,000 prevalent cases of MS in the U.S. and EU each year.
 There are two categories of MS: progressive MS, or PMS, and relapsing-remitting MS, or RRMS. RRMS is a form of MS that is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery and quiescence during which the disease does not progress. PMS is a severe form of MS that is characterized by persistent progression and worsening of MS symptoms and physical disability over time for which there are few therapeutic options. There are two types of PMS: secondary progressive MS, or SPMS, and primary progressive MS, or PPMS. Published reports indicate that together, SPMS and PPMS make up 30%-35% of MS patients. PPMS occurs when the patient has a disease course characterized by steady and progressive worsening after disease onset. SPMS initially begins as RRMS, but once patients have continuous progression of their disease, they have developed SPMS. 
 Scientific and clinical findings support a potential biologic connection between EBV and MS. EBV is present in nearly all patients with MS. The MS disease course has been shown to correlate with measures of EBV activity, and with exhaustion of EBV-specific T cell populations. In addition, in separate studies, clear differences in location and frequency of EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells were evident between the brains of subjects without MS and the brains of MS patients, where EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells were in close proximity to areas of active demyelination. Further data suggest that EBV-positive B cells and plasma cells in the CNS have the potential to catalyze an autoimmune response, resulting in the typical MS pathophysiology. In patients with MS, their T cells may be unable to control EBV-positive B cells and plasma cells so that B cells and plasma cells could then accumulate in the brain, function as antigen-presenting cells and generate antibodies that attack and destroy myelin, the protective layer that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord. This loss of myelin ultimately leads to MS symptoms. The role of B cells in MS is supported by the approval by the FDA of ocrelizumab for PPMS, which broadly targets B cells through their expression of a cell surface marker known as CD20.

In October 2015 and September 2016, we licensed rights to certain know-how and technology from QIMR Berghofer that uses targeted antigen recognition to create off-the-shelf T-cell immunotherapy product candidates applicable to a variety of diseases, including autoimmune conditions such as MS. Our license agreement with QIMR Berghofer, which we refer to as the 2016 QIMR License Agreement, requires that we make various milestone and royalty payments to QIMR Berghofer based on the sales of products arising from this collaboration, if any. We are also working with QIMR Berghofer on the development of EBV-targeted and other virally targeted T cells. Through this technology, we are expanding the role of T-cell-based immunotherapy beyond oncology and viral infections to autoimmune disease.
 Our T-cell immunotherapy product candidate utilizing this technology, ATA188 is an off-the-shelf EBV-specific T-cell preparation that utilizes a targeted antigen recognition technology that enables the T cells we administer to selectively identify cells expressing the EBV antigens that we believe are important for the potential treatment of MS. We are also developing ATA190, an autologous EBV-specific T-cell preparation. ATA190 utilizes the same approach to targeted antigen recognition as ATA188. These product candidates are designed to selectively target only those cells which are EBV-positive while sparing those that are not. We believe that eliminating only EBV-positive B cells and plasma cells has the potential to benefit some patients with MS. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated an open label, single arm, multi-center, multi-national Phase 1 study with ATA188 for patients with PMS and in January 2018 announced that we received clearance of our investigational new drug, or IND, application from the FDA to proceed with patient enrollment at U.S. sites.  In the first quarter of 2018, we initiated this study in the U.S. The primary objective of this Phase 1 study is to assess the safety of ATA188 in patients followed for at least one year after the first dose. Key secondary endpoints in the study include measures of clinical improvement such as Expanded Disability Status Scale, or EDSS, and annualized relapse rate, or ARR, as well as MRI imaging. We expect initial safety results from the ongoing ATA188 study in the first half of 2019. Additional safety and efficacy results from this study are expected in the second half of 2019.
 Our collaborating investigators at QIMR Berghofer have conducted a Phase 1 study utilizing autologous ATA190 for the treatment of patients with PMS. Based on the Phase 1 clinical results observed to date with ATA190, we believe the continued development of ATA190 will enhance our understanding of the potential therapeutic utility of targeting EBV in the treatment of MS and further inform and complement our development of ATA188. We plan to initiate a randomized ATA190 study in PMS patients in the second half of 2019.
 We expect to broadly explore the utility of our targeted antigen recognition technology in EBV-related and other virally driven diseases, and additional product candidates derived from our collaboration with QIMR Berghofer are being developed. As part of our collaboration with QIMR Berghofer, we entered into a research and development collaboration agreement, which requires us to reimburse the cost of agreed-upon development activities related to the collaboration and also provides for various milestone payments to QIMR Berghofer based on achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones.
 Next-Generation CAR T Program
In 2018, we entered into several agreements to expand our collaboration with MSK to the development of CAR T immunotherapies, with a license in May 2018 related to multiple collaboration targets and a license in December 2018 related to our next-generation allogeneic CAR T program targeting mesothelin. In our CAR T agreements with MSK, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialize certain collaboration targets and to make certain milestone and royalty payments.  
 In August 2018, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Moffitt to develop multi-targeted CAR T immunotherapies for patients with AML (ATA2321) and B cell malignancies (ATA2431). As part of this relationship, we agreed to collaborate with Moffitt to develop multi-targeted CAR T immunotherapies designed to address cancers with diverse cell types that often become resistant to treatment, such as AML and B-cell malignancies, and to make certain milestone and royalty payments associated with the collaboration targets. In addition, the collaboration includes the use of novel CAR T intracellular co-stimulatory domains based on CD28 and 4-1BB that may improve CAR T proliferation when responding to an appropriate antigen and enhance CAR T persistence by reducing T-cell exhaustion.
 We are rapidly advancing our CAR T pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas and expect results to be presented at upcoming scientific conferences. The first IND submission for our next-generation CAR T program is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020.

In addition to our partnered CAR T programs, we are also pursuing an internal allogeneic CD19 program. 
 Our next-generation CAR T oncology pipeline is summarized below:


Additional Platform Expansion Activities 
 We believe our platform will have utility beyond the current set of targets to which it has been directed. We continue to evaluate additional product candidates, including those derived from collaborations with our partners. We expect to further research and develop additional cellular therapies, which may include T-cell programs targeted against other antigens as well as engineered T-cell immunotherapies such as CAR T cell programs. We believe that viral antigens are well suited to adoptive immunotherapy given that people with normal immune systems are able to mount robust responses to these viral targets, but immunocompromised patients and some cancer patients are not. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to license or acquire additional product candidates or technologies to enhance our existing platform. 
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and public and private research institutions. Some of these potential competitors may have a more established presence in the market and significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 Should our T-cell product candidates be approved for use, we will face substantial competition. In addition to the current standard of care for patients, commercial and academic clinical studies are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of immunotherapy.  Early results from these studies have fueled continued interest in T-cell immunotherapy. In addition, if approved, our T-cell programs would compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the indications we are addressing, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications.
 EBV+ PTLD
There are currently no FDA- or EMA-approved products for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD. However, some approved products and therapies are used off-label in the treatment of EBV+ PTLD, such as rituximab and combination chemotherapy regimens. In addition, a number of companies and academic institutions are developing drug candidates for EBV+ PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases including: Viracta Therapeutics, Inc., which is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical study for tractinostat (VRx-3996) in combination with antiviral drug valganciclovir in relapsed/refractory EBV+ lymphomas, ViraCyte, LLC, which is conducting a Phase 2 clinical study for Viralym-MTM , an allogeneic, multi-virus T-cell product that targets five viruses including EBV and Tessa Therapeutics Pte Ltd., or Tessa, which is conducting a Phase 1 clinical study of MABEL CTLs, an allogeneic T-cell therapy in relapsed/ refractory EBV+ lymphomas.

NPC
 Drug therapies approved or commonly used for the treatment of NPC include radiation therapy, often given in combination with chemotherapy, and cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR.  Surgery for NPC is also occasionally used after chemoradiotherapy or to treat relapsed/refractory NPC.  Several development candidates are being evaluated for NPC.  Tessa is evaluating TT10, an autologous, EBV-specific T-cell product, in a phase 3 clinical study for advanced NPC. In addition, a number of companies are evaluating immunotherapies in combination with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors for the treatment of head and neck cancers, including NPC.  These include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s ipilimumab, relatilimab and daratumumab, Roche Pharmaceuticals’ bevacizumab and AstraZeneca PLC’s tremelimumab.
Multiple Sclerosis
 Competition in the MS market is high with at least 16 therapies, including three generics, approved for the treatment of RRMS in the U.S. and European Union.  There are many U.S. and international competitors in the RRMS market, including major multi-national fully-integrated pharmaceutical companies and established biotechnology companies.  Most recently, Ocrevus®, marketed by Roche Pharmaceuticals, was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS in the U.S. and European Union.  There are numerous development candidates in Phase 3 studies for RRMS including Novartis International AG’s, or Novartis, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, TG Therapeutics’ anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ublituximab and J&J/Actelion’s next-generation sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonist ponesimod.  There are also several therapeutic candidates awaiting FDA or EMA regulatory approval including EMD Serono’s cladribine, a lymphocyte-targeting agent, Biogen’s diroximel fumarate, a next-generation oral fumarate and Celgene’s ozanimod, an S1PR and S1PR5 agonist.
 Only three therapies have been approved for the treatment of PMS.  Recently, Ocrevus® was approved in the U.S. and European Union for the treatment of PPMS.  Extavia® (marketed by Novartis) and Betaseron® (marketed by Bayer AG) are approved in the European Union for the treatment of SPMS. In the U.S., there is one drug (mitoxantrone) approved to treat SPMS, which is now generic.  Novartis has filed marketing applications for siponimod in SPMS in both the U.S. and EU and is on track for launches in 2019.
 The SPMS and PPMS markets have active development pipelines and additional novel agents could be approved in the future.  Several development candidates are being evaluated in Phase 3 studies for progressive forms of MS including primary and secondary progressive MS. These are MedDay’s MD-1003, a concentrated form of biotin, and AB Science’s masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Medicinova’s ibudilast (MN166), a non-selective PDE inhibitor is in Phase 2 studies for primary and secondary progressive MS.  
 CAR T Program
 There are currently two CAR T therapies approved in the U.S. and EU, Novartis’ Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) and Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s and Kite Pharma’s Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel). However, given the explosion of innovation in this area, there are more than 100 CAR Ts in development with more than 35 being allogeneic and off-the-shelf cell therapies. In addition, depending on the diseases that our CAR T therapies target, we may face competition in the indication of interest from both CART therapies and other modalities such as small molecules and antibodies.
Terms of Certain License and Research and Development Collaboration Agreements 
 2015 MSK License Agreement
In June 2015, we entered into the 2015 MSK License Agreement. Under the terms of the 2015 MSK License Agreement, MSK granted us a worldwide, exclusive license to certain patent rights, know-how and a library of T cells and cell lines, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize T-cell products specific to CMV, EBV or WT1 that comprise or are based on or made using these licensed rights. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed products and, if commercialized, continue active marketing efforts for any commercialized licensed product through the term of the license agreement. 
 Under the 2015 MSK License Agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to $33.0 million with respect to the three licensed clinical stage T-cell programs based on achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-related milestones. We are also required to make escalating mid to high single-digit royalty payments to MSK based on sales of any licensed products. In addition, under certain circumstances, we must make certain minimum annual royalty payments to MSK, which are creditable against earned royalties owed for the same annual period. We are also obligated to pay a low double-digit percentage of consideration we receive for sublicensing the licensed rights. 
 10


The 2015 MSK License Agreement expires for each licensed T-cell product on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis and a country-by-country basis, on the latest of: (i) expiration of the last licensed patent rights related to a licensed product in a country, (ii) expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by law with respect to a licensed product in a country, and (iii) a specified number of years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product in a country. Upon expiration of the 2015 MSK License Agreement, the licenses granted to us will become non-exclusive royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable. MSK may terminate the 2015 MSK License Agreement if we materially breach the agreement and do not cure this breach within a specified period or if we experience certain insolvency events.
 QIMR Berghofer License Agreement and Research and Development Collaboration Agreement
 In September 2016, we entered into the 2016 QIMR License Agreement and an amended and restated research and development collaboration agreement, or the 2016 QIMR Collaboration Agreement, with QIMR Berghofer, each of which amended and restated prior agreements entered into with QIMR Berghofer in October 2015.  Under the 2016 QIMR License Agreement and 2016 QIMR Collaboration Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize allogeneic T-cell programs utilizing technology and know-how developed by QIMR Berghofer as well as the option to license additional technology in exchange for $3.3 million in cash. We exercised this option in June 2018. 
 The 2016 QIMR License Agreement provides for various milestone payments of up to $15 million and low to mid single-digit royalty payments to QIMR Berghofer base
d on future product sales, if any. Under the terms of the 2016 QIMR Collaboration Agreement, we are required to reimburse the cost of agreed-upon development activities related to programs developed under the collaboration. The 2016 QIMR Collaboration Agreement also provides for various milestone payments of up to $7 million to QIMR Berghofer based on achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones.
 We have the right at any time to terminate the 2016 QIMR License Agreement, at will, by providing written notice of termination to QIMR Berghofer and paying QIMR Berghofer a break-up fee equal to 50 percent of the amount of the next milestone payment that would be payable to QIMR Berghofer. QIMR Berghofer or we may terminate the 2016 QIMR Collaboration Agreement at any time if either party determines that the collaboration is no longer academically, technically, or commercially feasible by giving the other party 30-day written notice. In the event of a material breach of either agreement, QIMR Berghofer or we may terminate the agreement if the breaching party does not cure such breach within a specified period.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Some of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and other intellectual property rights we rely on are owned by us and others are in-licensed from our partners.  When we refer to “our” technologies, inventions, patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights, we are referring to both the rights that we own or possess as well as those that we in-license. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the U.S., Europe and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide certain periods of regulatory exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See “Government Regulation.” 
Patents
 We seek composition-of-matter and/or associated method patents, including method-of-treatment patents, for each of our product candidates in key therapeutic areas. The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications.  A provisional patent application is not examined for patentability by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and automatically expires 12 months after its filing date.  As a result, a provisional patent application cannot mature into an issued patent.  Provisional patent applications are often used, among other things, to establish an early effective filing date for a later-filed non-provisional patent application.  A non-provisional patent application is examined by the USPTO and can mature into a patent once the USPTO determines that the claimed invention meets the standards of patentability.

Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application, the priority date claimed, and the legal term of patents as determined by the applicable law in the countries in which those patents are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Additionally, patent term adjustments can extend term to account for certain delays by the USPTO during prosecution before that office. The duration of non-U.S. patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically, the life of a non-U.S. patent is 20 years from the earliest international filing date, not inclusive of any patent term extension that may be available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 National and international patent laws concerning protein-based biologics such as our products remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in patents in this field has emerged to date among the U.S., Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. or other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims for our patents and enforcing those claims once a patent is granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of any drug we may develop from our product candidates, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 Our global patent estate consists of both solely-owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications, is directed to compositions of matter and/or associated methods, including methods of treatment, and consists of 45 patent families having a total of more than 200 issued patents or patent applications.  Our patents and patent applications (if issued) are expected to expire between 2022 and 2038, not inclusive of any patent term extension that may be available is any associated jurisdiction.
 Trade Secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by an employee. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or any unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
Trademarks
 We also rely upon trademarks to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we continue to pursue and obtain trademark rights relating to our business. We have a vigorous global program of trademark registration and enforcement to maintain and strengthen the value of our trademarks and prevent the unauthorized use of those trademarks.  Our global trademark portfolio consists of 11 different trademarks having a total of more than 100 trademark registrations and pending trademark applications.

Government Regulation 
 Regulatory Overview
 Government authorities in the U.S. (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Overview of U.S. Government Regulation 
 Our product candidates, including tab-cel®, are regulated by the FDA as biologics which are reviewed by the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical studies to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization.
 Failure to comply with FDA requirements, either before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and criminal prosecution. 
 The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the U.S. generally include: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may commence;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish that the biological product is “safe, pure and potent”, which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP and in the case of our T-cell immunotherapy product candidates, good tissue practices, or GTP; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of the BLA and issuance of a biologics license.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Before conducting studies in humans, laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate must be conducted. Preclinical toxicology studies in animals must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical study lend themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within this 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold because of safety concerns about the product candidate or the conduct of the study described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical studies can proceed. 
 13


All clinical studies for new drugs and biologics must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the study, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical study must review and approve the protocol before a clinical study commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the study and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, and monitor the study until completed. 
 Clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different studies may be initiated with the same product candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. 
 Phase 1 clinical studies may be conducted in a limited number of patients or healthy volunteers, as appropriate. The product candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. 
 Phase 2 usually involves studies in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase 3 studies are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Results from one study are not necessarily predictive of results from later studies. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical studies at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 The results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for a proposed indication. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a BLA, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial but are subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. The fees typically increase each year. Each BLA submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the BLA is found complete, the FDA will file the BLA, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. 
 The expected speed of FDA review depends on whether a BLA application is considered to be a standard application or a priority application. The circumstances under which an application may be considered a priority application are discussed below under the heading “Expedited Review and Approval”. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard BLA applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a product candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMP. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a BLA supplement or a new BLA before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.

Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, a statutory pathway has been created for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act. The BPCIA also grants innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the U.S.
 Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the BLA for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP and GTP requirements, as applicable and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with these standards. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain compliance. 
 Orphan Drug Act 
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. at the time of application for orphan drug designation. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. However, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the U.S. during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 
 Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the U.S., including in the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period in the EU is for 10 years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if the sponsor completes a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the EMA. 
 Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track and RMAT are processes designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although Fast Track, RMAT and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track-designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical studies to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker study. 
 In addition to the Fast Track, RMAT, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, breakthrough therapy designation may be pursued. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review.

Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, in the U.S. there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Additionally, in May 2018, the U.S. presidential administration laid out a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. In January 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to U.S. federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, will affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. Although some of these and other proposals may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, members of Congress and the presidential administration have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Within the U.S., if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our product candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the Public Health Service, or PHS, pharmaceutical pricing program and also seek to sell the products to federal agencies. 
 Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
 Medicare is a federal program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. 
 Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting, and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for Part B covered drugs based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price. 
 Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS. FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and paid for by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended to not exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than inflation. 
 To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.

In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous elements of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by both the executive and legislative branches of the federal government to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the President signed Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. In December 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act.  The Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the presidential administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, but it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. Any other executive, legislative or judicial action to “repeal and replace” all or part of the Affordable Care Act may have the effect of limiting the amounts that government agencies will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure, or may lead to significant deregulation, which could make the introduction of competing products and technologies much easier.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical studies or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical study application, or CTA, which is much like an IND in the U.S., prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical studies. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. We expect to utilize the centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. If this committee delivers a favorable opinion, this typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. Conditional marketing authorization in the European Union is permitted based on incomplete clinical data for a limited number of medicinal products for human use, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under EU law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical study data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions.
 17


As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 11 years of exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, initiative was established by the EMA to help promote and foster the development of new medicines in the European Union that demonstrate potential for a major therapeutic advantage in areas of unmet medical need. Benefits from the PRIME designation include early confirmation of potential for accelerated assessment, early dialogue and increased interaction with relevant regulatory committees to discuss development options, scientific advice at key development milestones, and proactive regulatory support from the EMA.
 Outside the U.S., there are additional challenges in ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical study that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of this type of clinical study could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
 Additional Regulation 
 As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. 
Manufacturing
 In June 2018, we opened our dedicated and expandable manufacturing facility, ATOM, in Thousand Oaks, California.  ATOM has the flexibility to produce multiple T-cell and CAR T immunotherapies and integrates research and process science to enable rapid development.  The research and development and process and analytical development labs at ATOM are operationally supporting preclinical development activities. ATOM is designed to global regulatory standards, and the commissioning and qualification activities required to support ATOM manufacturing capacity to support clinical production are expected to be completed in 2019.
 In addition to ATOM, we also work with Cognate Bioservices, Inc., or Cognate, pursuant to a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement, or Manufacturing Agreement, that we entered into in August 2015 and which was amended in December 2017 and May 2018.  Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, Cognate provides process development and manufacturing services for certain of our product candidates. 
 Our current manufacturing strategy is to evaluate each product candidate and determine which site in our manufacturing network provides the phase-appropriate technical, quality and regulatory compliance requirements. In addition, the long-range supply requirements of our product candidates are evaluated quarterly to ensure we are planning manufacturing capacity and capabilities accordingly across our network. Our manufacturing network is comprised of ATOM, the manufacturing capabilities of our partners and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, including Cognate.  This strategic approach provides us with the flexibility to support our clinical and commercial production needs, address time or capacity constraints as well as provide supply redundancy, where appropriate.

Our T-cell product candidates require blood-derived starting materials which are received from healthy, consenting third-party donors through FDA- and EMA-compliant collection centers. The manufacturing process involves co-culturing and incubating viral- or cancer-specific antigen transformed B cells collected from the third-party donated material along with T cells collected from the same donor.  These manufacturing operations are conducted under Code of Federal Regulations Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, as well as Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs. GTPs are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues and cellular- and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. 
 Through agreements with our partners, we have acquired the right to use certain manufacturing process know-how related to producing clinical research-related drug supply. These include materials to support the manufacturing of clinical study material, including key starting materials and intermediates as well as existing inventory of clinical study materials.  We also have the ability to obtain supply from third parties to ensure we have the necessary blood donated from healthy consenting third-party donors.
