  Item 1. Business.
  
  General
  
  SeD Intelligent Home Inc., formerly known as Homeownusa, was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 10, 2009 with the intention of entering into the home equity lease/rent to own business. The Company is no longer pursuing this business plan. Our address is 4800 Montgomery Lane, Suite 210, Bethesda, MD, 20814. Our telephone number is 301-971-3940.
  
  On December 31, 2013, the Company’s sole director and officer and nine other shareholders sold their interest in the Company to CloudBiz International Pte, Ltd (“CloudBiz”), a Singapore corporation. The total number of shares purchased was 15,730 which represented a 69% interest in the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock (the “Transaction”). Along with the Transaction, the sole director and officer resigned and Mr. Conn Flanigan was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and sole director. On July 7, 2014 CloudBiz invested $37,000 in the Company. For such investment, CloudBiz received an additional 74 million shares of the Company’s common stock. In October 2014, the Company issued 20,534 shares to 30 new investors for total proceeds of $2,053. On December 22, 2016 Cloudbiz International Pte. Ltd transferred 74,015,730 common shares to Singapore eDevelopment. Singapore eDevelopment subsequently contributed its ownership in the Company to its subsidiary SeD Home International, Inc. (which also owned SeD Home, Inc. until December 29, 2017, at which time SeD Home International, Inc. contributed its shares of SeD Home to the Company). The majority of the Company’s common stock continues to be owned by SeD Home International, Inc. On January 10, 2017, our board of directors appointed Fai H. Chan as Director. On March 10, 2017, Mr. Rongguo (Ronald) Wei, CPA, was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
  
  On March 10, 2017, our board of directors approved and ratified a change in the Company's fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31, effective immediately as of the date of the board approval. On September 5, 2017, the Company changed its name to SeD Intelligent Home Inc., and increased its number of authorized shares to 1,000,000,000 (the par value per share remained $.001).
  
  On December 29, 2017, the Company, SeD Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”), SeD Home Inc. (“SeD Home”), a Delaware corporation, and SeD Home International, Inc., a Delaware corporation entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into SeD Home, with SeD Home surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The closing of this transaction (the “Closing”) also took place on December 29, 2017 (the “Closing Date”). Effective as of the Closing, the Company ceased to be a “shell company” as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The Company’s business operations became those operations that SeD Home is currently conducting, and may conduct in the future.
  
  In connection with the acquisition of SeD Home, the Company appointed new officers and directors. Fai H. Chan and Moe T. Chan serve as co-Chief Executive Officers; Rongguo (Ronald) Wei and Alan W. L. Lui serve as Co-Chief Financial Officers, and our Board of Directors includes Fai H. Chan, Moe T. Chan, Conn Flanigan and Charles MacKenzie.
  
  With the completion of the Company’s acquisition of SeD Home, we entered into the business of land development. While the Company will own real estate, the Company does not intend to be a REIT for federal tax purposes.
  
  SeD Home was incorporated in Delaware on February 24, 2015, and was named SeD Home USA, Inc. before changing its name in May of 2015. Prior to the Closing, SeD Home was entirely owned and controlled by Singapore eDevelopment and certain of its subsidiaries since its incorporation. Since SeD Home’s incorporation, the management and funding of SeD Home has been directed by Singapore eDevelopment’s management, including Singapore eDevelopment’s Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder, Fai H. Chan. The officers and directors of SeD Home are the same six individuals who are the officers and directors of the Company (listed above). SeD Home’s Black Oak project is a 162-acre land sub-division development located north of Houston, Texas. SeD Home’s Ballenger Run project is a 197-acre sub-division development near Washington D.C. in Frederick County, Maryland. SeD Home conducts its operations through ten wholly and partially owned subsidiaries. SeD Home’s affiliates will provide project and asset management via separate agreements with consultants.
  
  The land development business involves converting undeveloped land into buildable lots. When possible, in future projects we will attempt to mitigate risk by attempting to enter into contracts with strategic home building partners for the sale of lots to be developed. In such circumstances, it is our intention that (i) we will conduct a feasibility study on a particular land development; (ii) both SeD Home and the strategic home building partners will work together in connection with acquisition of the appropriate land; (iii) strategic home building partners will typically agree to enter into agreements to purchase up to 100% of the buildable lots to be developed; (iv) SeD Home and the strategic home building partners will enter into appropriate agreements; and (v) SeD Home will proceed to acquire the land for development and will be responsible for the infrastructure development, ensuring the completion of the project and delivery of buildable lots to the strategic home building partner.

  We also intend, to the fullest extent practicable, to source land where local government agencies (including county, district and other municipalities) and public authorities, such as improvement districts, will reimburse the majority of infrastructure costs incurred by the land developer for developing the land to build taxable properties. The developers and public authorities enter into agreements whereby the developers are reimbursed for their costs of infrastructure.
  
  The Company will also consider the potential to purchase foreclosure property development projects from banks, if attractive opportunities should arise.
  
  The Company, utilizing the extensive business network of its management and majority shareholder, may from time to time attempt to forge joint ventures with other parties. Through its subsidiaries, SeD Home may manage such joint ventures.
  
  In addition to the completion of our current projects, we intend to seek additional land development projects in diverse regions across the United States. Such projects may be within both the for-sale and for-rent markets, and we may expand from residential properties to other property types, including but not limited to commercial and retail properties. We will consider projects in diverse regions across the United States, however, SeD Home and its management and consultants have longstanding relationships with local owners, brokers, managers, lenders, tenants, attorneys and accountants to help it source deals throughout Maryland and Texas. SeD Home will continue to focus on off-market deals and raise appropriate financing.
  
  SeD Home, via a subsidiary, is presently exploring opportunities to expand its current portfolio by developing communities solely designed for renters. SeD Home is exploring the potential to pursue this new endeavor in part to improve cash flow and smooth out the inconsistencies of income in residential land development. SeD Home will continue to attempt to mitigate risk and maximize returns. At the present time, SeD Home owns one home through its subsidiary SeD USA, LLC which is rented. Previously, SeD Home owned other homes for rent which have been sold.
  
  Entering into the business of building homes with the intention of owning and renting those homes would provide an opportunity for SeD Home to create value by (i) acquiring properties for horizontal and vertical development; (ii) providing fee generation via property management and leasing; and (iii) capturing rent escalations over long term periods. SeD Home and its affiliates would provide property management for customers seeking to offload home maintenance and lawn care.
  
  Through our subsidiaries, we will explore the potential to pursue other business opportunities related to real estate. The Company is evaluating the potential to enter into activities related to real estate and home technologies, although we note that these potential opportunities remain at the exploratory stage, and we may not pursue these opportunities at the discretion of our management. The Company is particularly exploring opportunities related to smart home and eco-friendly home technologies.
  
  We also intend to enlarge the scope of property-related services. Additional planned activities, which we intend to be carried out through SeD Home, include financing, home management, realtor services, insurance and home title validation. We may particularly provide these services in connection with homes we build. These activities are also in the planning stages.
  
  The Company has expended minimal resources on the projects currently being explored as potential additions to our core land development business, consisting primarily of management time, payments for market studies and expenditures for the development of proposed floor plans for potential residential developments. The Company has not yet determined the estimated time frame for when it might commence operations in any such new business opportunities.
  
  As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $46,196,162 (as restated) and total liabilities of $13,733,045. Total assets as of December 31, 2017 were $58,166,606 and total liabilities were $24,561,292.
  
  Employees
  
  At the present time, the Company has four full time employees. Much of our work is done by contractors retained for projects, and at the present time we have no part time employees.

  Compliance with Government Regulation
  
  The development of our real estate projects will require the Company to comply with federal, state and local environmental regulations. In connection with this compliance, our real estate acquisition and development projects will require environmental studies. To date, the Company has spent approximately $42,356 on environmental studies and compliance. Such costs are reflected in construction progress costs in our financial statements.
  
  The cost of complying with governmental regulations is significant and will increase if we add additional real estate projects and become involved in homebuilding in the future and are required to comply with certain due diligence procedures related to third party lenders.
  
  At the present time, we believe that we have all of the material government approvals that we need to conduct our business as currently conducted. We are subject to periodic local permitting that must be addressed, but we do not anticipate that such requirements for government approval will have a material impact on our business as presently conducted. We are required to comply with government regulations and to make filings from time to time with various government entities. Such work is typically handled by outside contractors we retain.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  At the present time, the Company does not own any trademarks, but we anticipate filing trademark applications as we expand into new areas of business.
  
  Corporate Organization
  
  The following chart describes the Company’s ownership of various subsidiaries:

  Black Oak
  
  Our Black Oak project is a 162-acre land infrastructure development and sub-division project situated in Magnolia, Texas north of Houston. 150 Black Oak, Ltd. was a partnership formed by our former partner prior to our investment in this project. Black Oak had contracts to purchase seven contiguous parcels of land. Our initial equity investment was US$4.3 million for ownership of 60% of the partnership. Upon this initial investment in February 2014, we changed the name of the partnership to 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd (“Black Oak”) and subsequently increased our ownership to 69%. On July 23, 2018, SeD Development USA, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into two Partnership Interest Purchase Agreements through which it purchased an aggregate of 31% of Black Oak. Prior to the Partnership Interest Purchase Agreements, the Company owned and controlled Black Oak through its 68.5% limited partnership interest and its ownership of the General Partner, 150 Black Oak GP, Inc, a 0.5% owner in Black Oak. As a result of the purchase, the Company, through its subsidiaries, now owns 100% of Black Oak. 150 Black Oak GP, Inc., is wholly owned by SeD USA, LLC, which in turn is wholly owned by SeD Home. The limited partnership interests are owned by SeD Development USA, Inc., which is wholly owned by SeD Home. 150 Black Oak GP, Inc. was previously jointly owned with a partner, but is now entirely owned by SeD USA, LLC.
  
  Black Oak was obligated, under the Limited Partnership Agreement (as amended) signed between previous limited partners of Black Oak, to pay a $6,500 per month management fee to Arete Real Estate and Development Company (Arete), and $2,000 per month to American Real Estate Investments LLC (AREI). Arete was also entitled to be paid a developer fee of 3% of all development costs excluding certain costs. The fees were to accrue until $1,000,000 in revenue and/or builder deposits relating to the Black Oak Project has received. On December 31, 2017, the Company had $314,630 owed to Arete and $48,000 to AREI in accounts payable and accrued expenses. On April 26, 2018, SeD Development USA, Arete and AREI reached an agreement to terminate the terms related to management fees and developer fees in the Limited Partnership Agreement. In July 2018, per the terms of the termination agreement, Black Oak LP paid Arete $300,000 and AREI $30,000 to fulfill the commitments. Following the termination of these agreements and the payments, no further management fees or developer fees have accrued or been paid.
  
  In October 2015, the project obtained a $6.0 million construction loan from Revere High Yield Fund, LP. This loan was paid off in October of 2017. Currently the Black Oak project does not have any financing from third parties.
  
  The site plan at Black Oak is being revised to allow for approximately 420-512 residential lots of varying sizes. We anticipate that our involvement in land development aspects of this project will take approximately three to five additional years to complete. Since February of 2015, we have completed several important tasks related to the project, including clearing certain portions of the property, paving certain roads within the project and complying with the local improvement district to ensure reimbursement of these costs. 
  
 The estimated construction costs (not include land cost and financing costs) and completion date for each phase are as follows:
  
 
Black Oak | Estimated Construction Costs | Expected Completion Date
----------+------------------------------+-------------------------
Phase 1 | $7,080,000 | April 2019 
Phase 2 | 5,690,000 | April 2020 
Phase 3 | 3,850,000 | August 2020 
Phase 4 | 4,020,000 | April 2021 
Total | $20,640,000 | 


 
 On July 3, 2018, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd. entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Houston LD, LLC for the sale of 124 lots within the Black Oak project (the “Black Oak Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Black Oak Purchase Agreement, it was agreed that 124 lots would be sold for a range of prices based on the lot type. In addition, Houston LD, LLC agreed to contribute a “community enhancement fee” for each lot, collectively totaling $310,000 which is held in escrow. 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd. will apply these funds exclusively towards an amenity package on the property. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Black Oak Purchase Agreement was subject to Houston LD, LLC completing due diligence to its satisfaction.
  
 On July 20, 2018, Black Oak LP received $4,592,079 of district reimbursement for previous construction costs incurred in the land development. Of this amount, $1,650,000 will remain on deposit in the District’s Capital Projects Fund for the benefit of Black Oak LP and will be released upon receipt of the evidence of the: (a) execution of a purchase agreement between Black Oak LP and a home builder with respect to the Black Oak development and (b) of the completion, finishing and making ready for home construction of at least 105 unfinished lots in the Black Oak development. In 2018, $446,745 was released to reimburse the construction costs leaving a balance of $1,203,255 on December 31, 2018.
  
 On October 12, 2018, 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd. entered into an Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Black Oak Purchase Agreement”) for these 124 lots. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Black Oak Purchase Agreement, the purchase price remained at $6,175,000. 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd. was required to meet certain closing conditions and the timing for the closing was extended.
  
 On January 18, 2019, the sale of 124 lots at Black Oak was completed for $6,175,000 and the community enhancement fee equal to $310,000 was delivered to the escrow account. An impairment of real estate of approximately $2.4 million related to this sale was recorded on December 31, 2018. The revenue was recognized in January, 2019, when the sale was closed, and no gain or loss was recognized in January, 2019.
  
  At the present time, the Company is also considering expanding its current policy of selling buildable lots to include a strategy of building housing for sale or rent, particularly at our Black Oak property.

  Ballenger Run
  
  In November 2015, we completed the $15.65 million acquisition of Ballenger Run, a 197-acre land sub-division development located in Frederick County, Maryland. Previously, on May 28, 2014, the RBG Family, LLC entered into the Assignable Real Estate Sales Contract with NVR, Inc. (“NVR”) by which RBG Family, LLC would sell the 197 acres for $15,000,000 to NVR. On December 10, 2014, NVR assigned this contract to SeD Maryland Development, LLC in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and entered into a series of Lot Purchase Agreements by which NVR would purchase subdivided lots from SeD Maryland Development, LLC.
  
  SeD Maryland Development’s acquisition of the 197 acres was funded in part from a $5.6 million deposit from NVR Inc. (“NVR”). The balance of $10.05 million was derived from a total equity contribution of $15.2 million by SeD Ballenger LLC (“SeD Ballenger”) and CNQC Maryland Development LLC (a unit of Qingjian International Group Co, Ltd, China, “CNQC”). The project is owned by SeD Maryland Development, LLC (“SeD Maryland”). SeD Maryland is 83.55% owned by SeD Ballenger and 16.45% by CNQC.
  
  SeD Maryland entered into a Project Development and Management Agreement for Ballenger Run with MacKenzie Development Company, LLC and Cavalier Development Group, LLC on February 25, 2015. MacKenzie Development Company, LLC assigned its rights and obligations to this agreement to Adams Aumiller Properties, LLC on September 9, 2017. Pursuant to this Project Development and Management Agreement, Adams Aumiller, LLC and Cavalier Development Group, LLC coordinate and manage the construction, financing, and development of Ballenger Run. SeD Maryland compensates Adams Aumiller LLC and Cavalier Development Group, LLC with a monthly aggregate fee of $14,667 until all single family and townhome lots are sold. The monthly aggregate fee will then adjust to $11,000 which will continue for approximately eight months to allow all close out items to be finished including the release of guarantees and securities as required by the government authorities. The Project Development and Management Agreement for Ballenger Run also requires SeD Maryland to pay a fee of $1,200 and $500 for each single-family and townhome, respectively, sold to a third party. SeD Maryland also paid a fee of $50,000 after the sale of the parcel underlying the multi-family lots in August 2018.
  
  This property is zoned for 443 entitled Residential Lots, 210 entitled Multifamily Units and 200 entitled continuing care retirement community units approved for twenty (20) years from the date of a Developers Rights & Responsibilities Agreement dated October 8, 2014, as amended on September 6, 2016. We are presently seeking to revise the zoning of this property to include 479 entitled residential lots and 210 entitled multi-family units, with no entitled continuing care retirement community units. We anticipate that the completion of our involvement in this project will take approximately three years from the date of this Annual Report.
  
  Revenue from Ballenger Run is anticipated to come from three main sources:
  
  ● The sale of 479 entitled and constructed residential lots to NVR;
   ● The sale of the lot for the 210 entitled multi-family units; and
   ● The sale of 479 front foot benefit assessments.
  
  Revenues may be adversely impacted, if we fail to attain certain goals, meet certain conditions or if market prices for this development unexpectedly begin to drop.
  
  The estimated construction costs (not include land cost and financing costs) and completion date for each phase are as follows:
  
 
Ballenger Run | Estimated Construction Costs | Expected Completion Date
--------------+------------------------------+-------------------------
Phase 1 | $13,786,000 | Completed 
Phase 2 | 10,210,000 | December 2019 
Phase 3 | 10,170,000 | September 2020 
Phase 4 | 3,460,000 | March 2020 
Phase 5 | 1,690,000 | December 2021 
Total | $39,316,000 |

  Financing from Union Bank (f/k/a The Bank of Hampton Roads, Shore Bank and Xenith Bank) closed simultaneous with the settlement on the land on November 23, 2015, pursuant to a subsequent amendment to the terms of this loan, the loan provides (i) for a maximum of $11 million outstanding; (ii) that the maturity of this loan will be December 31, 2019; and (iii) includes an $800,000 letter of credit facility, with an annual rate of 1.5% on all issued letters of credit.
  
  This loan is to fund the development of the first 276 lots, the multi-family parcel and senior living parcel, the amenities associated with these phases, and certain road improvements.
  
  Expenses from Ballenger Run include, but are not limited to costs associated with land prices, closing costs, hard development costs, cost in lieu of construction, soft development costs and interest costs. We presently estimate these costs to be between $55 and $56 million. We may also encounter expenses which we have not anticipated, or which are higher than presently anticipated.
  
  This project will have five phases. The first phase has been completed and we are currently in the second phase for completion of this project.
  
  The following chart describes the various phases of this project (the chart does not reflect our current attempt to revise the zoning at this project to reflect the addition of 36 villa lots to replace the 200 continuing care retirement community units originally planned):
  
 
  Phase 1 construction of all infrastructure was completed in 2017. The initial model lot sales with NVR began in May 2017 and all lot sales of varying types as outlined in the chart set forth above are continuing through the first quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017 all improvement plans and cost estimates were approved for Phases 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D. Phase 2B is the next phase of lot takedowns for NVR. Phase 2B plat recordation and final construction began in March of 2018. Lot sales to NVR also began in March of 2018. Phases 2A and 2C plat recordation and construction began in June of 2018. Phase 2D construction began in September.
  
  Sale of Residential Lots
  
  The 479 Residential Lots were contracted for sale under a Lot Purchase Agreement to NVR, a company based in the US and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. NVR is a home builder which is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhouses and condominium buildings. It also operates a mortgage banking and title services business. Under the Lot Purchase Agreements, NVR provided SeD Home with an upfront deposit of $5.6 million and has agreed to purchase the lots at a range of prices. The lot types and quantities to be sold to NVR under the Lot Purchase Agreements include the following:

Lot Type | Quantity
-----------------------------------------+---------
Single Family Detached Large | 85 
Single Family Detached Small | 89 
Single Family Detached Neo Traditional | 33 
Single Family Attached 28’ Villa | 121 
Single Family Attached 20’ End Unit | 46 
Single Family Attached 16’ Internal Unit | 105 
Total | 479

  There are five different types of Lot Purchase Agreements (“LPAs”), which are essentially the same except for the price and unit details for each type of lot. Under the LPAs, NVR shall purchase 30 available lots per quarter. The LPAs provide several conditions related to preparation of the lots which must be met so that a lot can be made available for sale to NVR. SeD Maryland is to provide customary lot preparation including but not limited to survey, grading, utilities installation, paving, and other infrastructure and engineering. In the event NVR does not purchase the lots under the LPAs, SeD Maryland would be entitled to keep the NVR deposit and terminate the LPAs. Should SeD Maryland breach the LPAs, it would have to return the remainder of the NVR deposit that has not already been credited to NVR for any sales of lots under the LPAs and NVR would be able to seek specific performance of the LPAs as well as any other rights available at law or in equity.
  
  The sale of 13 model lots to NVR began in May of 2017. 102 lots were sold in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 42 lots sold in the year ended December 31, 2017. NVR has started marketing houses and has commenced sales. 
  
  Sale of Lots for the Multi-family Units
  
 In June 2016, SeD Maryland entered into a lot purchase agreement with Orchard Development Corporation relating to the sale of 210 multifamily units in the Ballenger Run Project for a total purchase price of $5,250,000, which closed on August 7, 2018.
  
  Sale of the Front Foot Benefit Assessments
  
  We have established a front foot benefit assessment on all of the NVR lots. This is a 30-year annual assessment allowed in Frederick County which requires homeowners to pay the developer to reimburse the costs of installing public water and sewer to the lots. These assessments become effective as homes are settled, at which time we can sell the collection rights to the assessments to investors who will pay a lump sum up front so we can realize the revenue sooner. Front foot benefit assessments are subject to amendment by regulatory agencies, legislative bodies, and court rulings, and any changes to front foot benefit assessments could cause us to reassess these projections.
 Wetland Impact Permit
  
  The Ballenger project will require a joint wetland impact permit, which requires the review of several state and federal agencies, including the US Army Corps of Engineers. The permit is primarily required for Phase 3 construction which will not start until 2019 or later but it also affects a pedestrian trail at the Ballenger project and the multi-family sewer connection. The US Army Corps of Engineers allowed us to proceed with construction on Phase 1 but required archeological testing. As of the date of this report, the archeological testing has been completed with no further recommendations on Phase 1 of the project. Required architectural studies on the final phase of development will likely result in the loss of only one lot, however, we cannot be certain of future reviews and their impact on the project.
 K-6 Grade School Site
  
  In connection with getting the necessary approvals for the Ballenger Project, we agreed to transfer thirty acres of land that abuts the development for the construction of a local K-6 grade school. We will not be involved in the construction of such school.
 Home Incubation Project
  
  Recognizing that large land sub-division projects have a longer time horizon, we previously introduced a home incubation initiative to market completed U.S. single-family homes, with existing tenants, to investors in Asia (the “Home Incubation Project”).
  
  Under the Home Incubation Project, we purchased 27 homes, mostly located in Texas. We sold 24 of the homes by the end of 2016 and an additional two in 2017. SeD Home retains only one rental home at the present time.  
  
  Competition
  
  There are a number of companies engaged in the development of land. Should we expand our operations into the business of constructing homes ourselves, we will face increased competition, including competition from large, established and well-financed companies, some of which may have considerable ties and experience in the geographical areas in which we seek to operate. Similarly, as we consider other opportunities we may wish to pursue in addition to our current land development business, we anticipate that we will face experienced competitors.
  
  We will compete in part on the basis of the skill, experience and innovative nature of our management team, and their track record of success in diverse industries.
