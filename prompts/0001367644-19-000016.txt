 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 OVERVIEW
 
Emergent BioSolutions Inc. is a global life sciences company focused on providing to civilian and military populations a portfolio of innovative preparedness and response products and solutions that address accidental, deliberate and naturally occurring public health threats (“PHTs,” each a “PHT”). We were incorporated in the State of Michigan in May 1998 and subsequently reorganized as a Delaware corporation in June 2004.
 
We are focused on the following four distinct PHT categories: Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (“CBRNE”); emerging infectious diseases (“EID”); travelers’ diseases; and opioids. We have a product portfolio of eleven products (vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and drug-device combination products) that generate a majority of our revenue. We also have a development pipeline consisting of a diversified mix of both pre-clinical and clinical stage product candidates (vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and drug-device combination products). Finally, we also have a fully-integrated portfolio of contract development and manufacturing services. The U.S. government (the “USG”) is the largest purchaser of our products and provides us with substantial funding for the development of a number of our product candidates. We continue to pursue acquiring and developing products and solutions that provide an opportunity to serve both government customers and commercial (non-government) customers (“Dual Market”).
 
STRATEGY
 
Our strategy is centered on our core business of addressing PHTs. This strategy contemplates that we:

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND COLLABORATIONS
 
We have a track record of growth through the acquisition of revenue-generating and accretive products and businesses. Our goal is to continue our expansion through targeted acquisitions of (1) government-procured products; (2) Dual-Market product opportunities, which are products that have both government and non-government / commercial market potential; and (3) products that are purely commercial in nature, but would leverage our core competencies in a unique way. Below is a summary of our significant acquisitions, transactions and collaborations.
Adapt Pharma Limited
 
On October 15, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Adapt Pharma Limited (“Adapt”), and its NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray marketed product, the first and only needle-free formulation of naloxone approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and Health Canada, for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. This acquisition includes the NARCAN® Nasal Spray marketed product and a development pipeline of new treatment and delivery options to address opioid overdose, and approximately 50 employees, located in the U.S., Canada, and Ireland, including those responsible for supply chain management, research and development, government affairs, and commercial operations.
 
We paid approximately $581.5 million in cash at the closing (inclusive of closing adjustments) and issued 733,309 shares of Common Stock, based on the volume-weighted average price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten-trading day period ending two days before closing, or $65.28 per share (an aggregate total of $47.9 million, inclusive of adjustments). The remaining consideration payable for the acquisition consists of up to $100 million in cash based on the achievement of certain sales milestones through 2022. The Company funded the cash portion of the payments made at closing using a combination of cash-on-hand and borrowings under its Amended Credit Agreement, as described in the Long-term debt section below.
 
PaxVax Holding Company Ltd.
 
On October 4, 2018, we completed the acquisition of PaxVax Holding Company Ltd. (“PaxVax”), a company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing specialty vaccines that protect against existing and emerging infectious diseases. This acquisition includes Vivotif® (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a), the only oral vaccine licensed by the FDA for the prevention of typhoid fever, Vaxchora® (Cholera Vaccine, Live, Oral), the only FDA-licensed vaccine for the prevention of cholera, an adenovirus 4/7 vaccine candidate being developed for military personnel under contract with the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and additional clinical-stage vaccine candidates targeting chikungunya and other emerging infectious diseases, European-based current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) biologics manufacturing facilities, and approximately 250 employees including those in research and development, manufacturing, and commercial operations with a specialty vaccines salesforce in the U.S. and in select European countries.
 
At the closing, we paid a cash purchase price of $273.1 million (inclusive of closing adjustments), using a combination of cash-on-hand and borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement.
 
ACAM2000
 
In October 2017, we completed the acquisition of the ACAM2000® (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live) business of Sanofi Pasteur Biologics, LLC. This acquisition included ACAM2000, the only smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA, a licensed, live-viral manufacturing facility and office and warehouse space, both in Canton, Massachusetts (for which we received FDA manufacturing approval for the transfer of the upstream portion of the manufacturing process of ACAM2000 in November 2017), and a live-viral fill/finish facility in Rockville, Maryland. With this acquisition, we also acquired a 10-year contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), which expired in March 2018. This contract was originally valued at up to $425 million, and upon acquisition had a remaining value at acquisition of up to approximately $160 million, reflecting the value of doses of ACAM2000 remaining to be delivered to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (“SNS”). As of December 31, 2018, there remains a portion of doses still to be delivered to the SNS under the current BARDA procurement contract. We expect to complete deliveries of such doses in 2019. We are negotiating a new multi-year contract with the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (“ASPR”) to deliver additional doses into the SNS.
 
Total consideration for this acquisition was $125 million. At closing, we paid $117.5 million in cash. The agreement also included an additional cash milestone payment of $7.5 million based upon FDA approval of the Canton facility for the manufacturing of ACAM2000. This regulatory milestone was achieved based on such approval in November 2017 and paid in cash in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
raxibacumab
 
In October 2017, we completed the acquisition from Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline LLC, collectively GSK, of raxibacumab, the first fully-human monoclonal antibody product licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. Total consideration for this acquisition was up to $96 million. At closing, we paid $76 million in cash. The agreement also included up to $20 million in future cash payments tied to product sales and manufacturing-related milestones. As of December 31, 2018, the milestones had not yet been achieved. With the acquisition, we assumed responsibility for a multi-year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) with a remaining value at acquisition of up to approximately $130 million, to supply raxibacumab to the SNS through November 2019. We are currently in the process of pursuing FDA licensure for the transfer of bulk manufacturing of raxibacumab to our Bayview facility and the fill/finish process to our Camden facility, and under the terms of the acquisition agreements we will purchase product from GSK to enable completion of deliveries to the SNS under the current BARDA procurement contract.
 
Spin-Off of Biosciences Business
 
In August 2016, we completed a tax-free spin-off of our former biosciences business into a separate, stand-alone publicly-traded company, Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. (“Aptevo”). As part of the spin-off transaction, the assets that were a part of our former biosciences business segment were transferred to Aptevo. These assets included our former biosciences commercial products IXINITY [coagulation factor IX (recombinant)], WinRho® SDF [(Rho(D) Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)], HepaGam B® [Hepatitis B Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] and VARIZIG® [Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (Human)], as well as our former oncology and hematology therapeutics development assets and platforms.
 
Cangene Corporation
 
In February 2014, we acquired Cangene Corporation, which included the following products: BAT® for the treatment of botulism; Anthrasil for the treatment of anthrax infection; and VIGIV for the treatment of adverse reactions to vaccinia virus vaccinations. The acquisition also included a hyperimmune technology platform as part of a manufacturing site in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (our Winnipeg site), and which is used to manufacture the BAT, Anthrasil and VIGIV products. We also acquired Cangene's fill/finish contract manufacturing services business in Baltimore, Maryland (our Camden facility), including agreements with customers to fill/finish a number of commercial and clinical-stage products worldwide.

OUR BUSINESS UNITS
 
We are organized into four business units: Vaccines and Anti-Infectives; Devices; Antibody Therapeutics; and Contract Development and Manufacturing.
 
Vaccines and Anti-Infectives
 
Products
 
Our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives business unit contains a portfolio of specialty vaccines and unique anti-infectives that address existing and emerging PHTs. The current portfolio consists of the following products.

VACCINES AND ANTI-INFECTIVES UNIT 
---------------------------------------------
Product | Indication(s) | Regulatory Approvals 
BioThrax® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) | GUP - General use prophylaxis of anthrax disease; and PEP - Post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. | United States, Germany, Singapore, UK, Germany, Netherlands, France, Poland, Italy and Canada. 
ACAM2000® (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live) | Vaccination for active immunization against smallpox disease for persons determined to be at high risk for smallpox. | United States, Australia, Singapore 
Vaxchora® (Cholera Vaccine Live Oral) | Oral vaccine for the prevention of cholera. | United States 
Vivotif® (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a) | Oral vaccine for the prevention of typhoid fever. | United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, UK, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, The Czech Republic, Slovakia 

 
BioThrax® (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed). BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for the general use prophylaxis (“GUP”), of anthrax disease. In April 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to BioThrax for the post-exposure prophylaxis (“PEP”), indication, (please see “Regulation – Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines– Orphan Drugs”), giving it market exclusivity in the United States until November 2022. In November 2015, the FDA approved our supplemental Biologics License Application (“BLA”), to expand the BioThrax label to include the PEP indication for BioThrax administered in combination with antimicrobial therapy. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the spore forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax. Death due to inhalational anthrax infection often occurs within 24-36 hours of the onset of advanced respiratory complications. In the U.S., BioThrax is administered in a GUP setting by intramuscular injection in a three-dose primary series over an initial six-month period. The vaccine is protective after completion of this three-dose primary series. After the primary series, two additional doses are given one each at 12 and 18 months, with booster doses annually thereafter. BioThrax is administered in a PEP setting in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs following suspected or confirmed Bacillus anthracis exposure. The vaccination schedule for PEP consists of three doses of BioThrax administered subcutaneously at 0, 2- and 4-weeks post-exposure combined with antimicrobial therapy. In December 2016, we signed a follow-on contract with the CDC, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) for the supply of up to approximately 29.4 million doses of BioThrax for delivery into the SNS, over a five-year period ending in September 2021. The potential value of this contract is approximately $911 million, if all procurement options are exercised. In March 2017, we entered into an additional contract with BARDA, originally valued at up to $100 million, for the delivery of BioThrax to the SNS, over a two-year period of performance. We completed deliveries under this contract in 2017.
 
In August 2016, the FDA licensed Building 55, our large-scale manufacturing facility in Lansing, Michigan, for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually.
 
ACAM2000® (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live). ACAM2000 is the only smallpox vaccine licensed by the FDA and is the primary smallpox vaccine designated for use in a bioterrorism emergency, with more than 230 million doses having been supplied to the SNS. ACAM2000 is also licensed in Australia and Singapore and is currently stockpiled both in the United States and internationally. Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the variola virus, a member of the orthopox virus family. According to the CDC, it is one of the most devastating diseases with a mortality rate as high as 30%. ACAM2000 is administered by percutaneous route in one dose with a bifurcated needle using the multiple puncture method. The vaccine stimulates a person's immune system to develop antibodies and cells in the blood and elsewhere that can then help the body fight off a smallpox infection if exposure to smallpox occurs. Upon the closing of the ACAM2000 acquisition, we acquired a 10-year CDC contract, which expired in March 2018. The original contract, valued at up to $425 million, called for the delivery of ACAM2000 to the SNS and establishing U.S.-based manufacturing of ACAM2000, specifically the transfer of the upstream portion of the ACAM2000 production process from Austria to a U.S.-based manufacturing facility. This technology transfer was completed and approved by the FDA in November 2017 and we are continuing to make deliveries under the prior contract. At acquisition, there was $160 million of remaining value on the prior contract subject to the availability of government funding, and we expect to fulfill the remaining product deliveries to the SNS in the first half of 2019.  We are negotiating a new multi-year contract with ASPR to deliver additional doses into the SNS.
 
Vaxchora®. (Cholera Vaccine Live Oral) Vaxchora is a live attenuated cholera vaccine for oral administration and the first vaccine approved by the FDA for the prevention of cholera infection. Cholera, a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa, Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers from the U.S., so cholera can occur in patients who return to the U.S. from visits to these regions. Vaxchora is indicated for active immunization against cholera caused by the bacterium V. cholerae serogroup O1. Vaxchora is approved for use in patients 18–64 years of age who are traveling to known cholera-infected areas.
 
Vivotif®. (Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a) Vivotif is a live attenuated vaccine for oral administration to prevent typhoid fever. The vaccine contains the attenuated strain Salmonella typhi Ty21a (1,2). Typhoid fever is a potentially severe and occasionally life-threatening febrile illness caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi), a bacterium that only lives in humans. It is usually acquired by consumption of water or food that has been contaminated by feces of an infected person. Typhoid fever is uncommon in North America and Europe. However, travelers from North America and Europe going to Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been particularly at risk. Even short-term travel to high-incidence areas is associated with risk for typhoid fever. In the U.S., Vivotif is indicated for immunization of adults and children greater than 6 years of age against disease caused by S Typhi.

NuThrax™ (anthrax vaccine adsorbed with CPG 7909 adjuvant). We are developing NuThrax, an anthrax vaccine product candidate based on BioThrax combined with CPG 7909, an adjuvant that we license from Pfizer Inc. We are developing NuThrax, in part with funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (“NIAID”) and BARDA, to potentially elicit a more rapid onset of immune response using fewer doses than BioThrax while still providing protective immunity in patients. Using funds from our 2010 development contract with NIAID, in October 2014, we completed a Phase 2 safety, immunogenicity and dose ranging clinical trial of NuThrax in which all endpoints were successfully met, including requiring a two-dose regimen, versus the BioThrax three-dose regimen, which may shorten the recommended antibiotic (60-day) regimen for anthrax post-exposure prophylaxis. In September 2014, we also obtained additional funding through a five-year development contract with NIAID of up to $29 million to support the development of a dry formulation of NuThrax, including: assay development and non-clinical activities through the preparation of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA. The dry formulation of NuThrax is intended to increase stability of the vaccine candidate at ambient and higher temperatures, with the objective of eliminating the need for cold chain during shipping and storage. In March 2015, we signed a development contract with BARDA valued at $31 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease. In September 2016, we signed a combination development and procurement contract with BARDA for up to approximately $1.5 billion, including a five-year base period of performance valued initially at approximately $200 million to develop NuThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax disease and to deliver to the SNS an initial two million doses, subsequently modified to three million doses in March 2017, following Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) pre-approval by the FDA. We applied for EUA in the fourth quarter of 2018 and, although there can be no assurances, we anticipate that the FDA could grant EUA designation to NuThrax as early as this year, triggering the initial three million dose delivery of NuThrax into the SNS in 2019. The contract also includes procurement options for the delivery of an additional 7.5 million to 50 million doses of NuThrax into the SNS, valued from approximately $255 million to up to $1.3 billion, respectively, and options for an additional clinical study and post-marketing commitments valued at $48 million, which, if all were to be exercised in full, could increase the total contract value to approximately $1.5 billion. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations – Overview – Highlights and Business Accomplishments for 2018” for additional details.
 
Chikungunya. We licensed the chikungunya virus (“CHKV”), a virus-like particle (“VLP”), vaccine product candidate from the Vaccine Research Center ("VRC") at the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"). VLPs for alphaviruses are comparable to the physical structure of the native virus, and contain repetitive, high density displays of viral surface proteins that present conformational viral epitopes that elicit strong B- and T-cell immune responses. Since VLPs cannot replicate, they provide a safer alternative to attenuated and inactivated vaccines throughout production and use and can be administered in unrestricted target populations. VRC has previously demonstrated in this product candidate both nonclinical and clinical (Phase 1) safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data. A key passive transfer study demonstrated that mice dosed with purified antibody from VLP-immunized NHPs were protected from an otherwise lethal CHKV infection. We established and scaled a CHKV cGMP production process at our facilities in San Diego, California. A Phase 1 trial demonstrated that the vaccine elicits anti-CHKV neutralizing antibody responses in humans significantly above the level believed to be protective in the passive transfer study. Two Phase 2 safety and immunogenicity trials are currently ongoing. The NIH has sponsored a Phase 2 trial  at multiple endemic sites in the Caribbean. The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 200 subjects, which was initiated in 2016. The subjects are currently being followed for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. As of August 2018, we have completed enrollment of the Phase 2 study. The primary objectives are to assess safety and anti-CHKV neutralizing antibody responses with different doses, different formulations and different dosing schedules. The study will also assess duration of neutralizing antibody responses induced by different formulations and schedules. Upcoming development activities include Phase 3 development, including process validation and manufacture, Phase 3 clinical studies in the U.S. and CHKV endemic areas, supportive nonclinical toxicity and efficacy studies, and a BLA submission. Collectively, these studies are intended to provide clinical and regulatory data for U.S. licensure and possible World Health Organization prequalification.
 
Adenovirus 4/7. In 2014, we formed a partnership with the DoD to modernize the production of the Adenovirus vaccine (“ADVV-MP”). An IND application for a new ADVV-MP was submitted to the FDA on January 30, 2017 and a Phase 1 study has been completed that demonstrates high seroconversion rates for Ad 7, indicating vaccine efficacy. Further development activities of the ADVV-MP will be dependent upon a continued partnership with the DoD and subject to government funding.
 
rVSV-VHF (vector vaccines for hemorrhagic fever). In November 2017, we entered into an agreement with Profectus to have the option to license multiple vector vaccine product candidates, including those for Nipah, and viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by Ebola, Marburg and Lassa viruses. In April 2018, we exercised our development license for rVSV-Marburg and rVSV-Quad vaccines. In October 2018, we exercised our development rights to rVSV-Lassa, rVSV-Ebola and rVSV-Sudan. The rVSV-Quad vaccine development is currently being funded by a contract award to Profectus from the NIAID under which we are performing manufacturing activities.
 
In August 2018, CEPI announced a collaboration with us and Profectus, under which the parties may receive up to $36 million to advance the development and manufacture of a vaccine against the Lassa virus. Lassa virus infection—a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arenaviridae—can cause the acute viral hemorrhagic illness known as Lassa fever. The virus is spread to humans via contact with food or household items that have been contaminated with urine or feces from Mastomys rats. Under the terms of the Framework Partnering Agreement for the collaboration among the three parties, Profectus will receive development funding from CEPI for advancing its Lassa virus vaccine. CEPI will provide $4.3 million to support the first phase of the project, with options to invest up to a total of $36 million over five years, including procurement of the vaccine for stockpiling purposes. We will provide technical and manufacturing support for the CEPI-funded program. Through our agreement executed with Profectus in October 2018, we have exercised the option to license and to assume control of development activities for the rVSV-Lassa vaccine from Profectus.
 
Below is a brief description of the primary rVSV-VHF candidates.

raxibacumab. raxibacumab is the first fully-human monoclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax due to bacillus anthracis. It was licensed by the FDA in December 2012 and has orphan drug designation in the United States, giving it market exclusivity in the United States until December 2019. raxibacumab is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate. raxibacumab has been supplied to the SNS since 2009 under contracts with BARDA. Upon the closing of our acquisition of raxibacumab from GSK, we assumed responsibility for a multi-year contract with BARDA, valued at up to approximately $130 million at acquisition, to supply the product to the SNS through November 2019. We intend to pursue negotiation of a follow-on contract with the USG to ensure the uninterrupted supply of this medical countermeasure (“MCM”) to the SNS. Under the terms of our acquisition agreements, we intend to purchase product from GSK to enable completion of deliveries to the SNS under the existing BARDA procurement contract. We have initiated the process of the transfer of raxibacumab bulk manufacturing from GSK to our Bayview facility and fill/finish activities to our Camden facility.
 
Anthrasil® [Anthrax Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. Anthrasil is comprised of purified human polyclonal immune globulin G (“IgG”) containing polyclonal antibodies directed to the anthrax toxins of Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax disease, and is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with our BioThrax vaccine. Anthrasil was licensed by the FDA in March 2015 for the treatment of suspected or documented inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Simultaneous with FDA approval in 2015, Anthrasil also received orphan drug designation, resulting in market exclusivity in the United States until March 2022. To date, the principal customer for Anthrasil has been the USG, specifically HHS. Anthrasil is procured by BARDA for delivery into the SNS. We have two current contracts with BARDA: a development and procurement contract that expires in April 2021 and a multiple award, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, as well as the manufacture of such plasma into bulk drug substance and finished drug product and delivery of finished product into the SNS. BARDA issued a task order under this second contract for the collection of anti-anthrax plasma, which was completed in 2015. BARDA issued a second task order in 2018 under this contract to extend the plasma collection storage, and to include options for manufacturing and product delivery; these options are available to be exercised by BARDA through September 2023. In addition to domestic government sales, Anthrasil has been sold to several foreign governments. In December 2017, we were awarded a contract by the Canadian Department of National Defence, valued at approximately $8 million, to deliver Anthrasil to the Canadian government. This contract award follows the December 2017 approval of Anthrasil by Health Canada under the Extraordinary Use New Drug (“EUND”) Regulations, which provide a regulatory pathway in Canada for products for which collecting clinical information for its intended use in humans is logistically or ethically not possible.
 
BAT® [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G)-(Equine)]. BAT is the only heptavalent antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulism. BAT is comprised of purified polyclonal equine immune globulins (antibodies) directed to the seven toxins (A through G) produced by Clostridium botulinum. BAT was licensed by the FDA in the United States in March 2013 for the treatment of suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin A, B, C, D, E, F or G. It was also licensed in Canada in December of 2016 pursuant to Health Canada’s EUND regulations. Simultaneous with FDA licensure in 2013, BAT also received orphan drug designation, resulting in market exclusivity in the United States until March 2020. BAT is the only heptavalent botulism antitoxin available in the United States or Canada for treating naturally occurring botulism in adults or pediatric patients. Botulinum toxin is a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes botulism, a serious paralytic illness. Naturally occurring cases are mainly seen in infants or in adults who have consumed improperly processed foods. Botulinum toxin can also be used as a bioterrorism agent and has been identified in the United States as one of the highest priority bioterrorism threats. To date, the principal customer for BAT has been the USG, specifically HHS. We are currently operating under a procurement contract with BARDA in support of the program; this contract also includes stability testing, post marketing commitments, and manufacturing. We signed a modification to our contract with BARDA to manufacture and store bulk drug substance for BAT in March 2017, valued at approximately $53 million with a five-year period of performance. This modification to the contract is intended to enable future filling and deliveries of final drug product to the SNS. In addition to domestic government sales, BAT continues to be sold internationally, with deliveries to over 15 foreign governments in 2018. For example, we have a 10-year contract, executed in 2012, to supply BAT to the Canadian Department of National Defense as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada and individual provincial health authorities.
 
VIGIV [Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]. VIGIV is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA to address certain complications from smallpox vaccination. VIGIV is comprised of purified polyclonal human immune globulins (antibodies) directed to the vaccinia virus, the virus that is used in replicating virus vaccinations, such as ACAM2000, a product that is currently being procured and delivered into the SNS. VIGIV is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with our ACAM2000 vaccine or previously immunized with the DryVax vaccine. Vaccinia is not the virus that causes smallpox, but it is similar enough to elicit a protective immune response when used as a smallpox vaccine. Individuals who are susceptible to vaccinia may develop an infection from ACAM2000 or other similar replicating virus vaccines, and these patients may benefit from treatment with VIGIV. VIGIV was licensed by the FDA in May 2005 and by Health Canada in May 2007 for counteracting certain complications that can be associated with smallpox vaccination. Although VIGIV has been sold to foreign governments, to date, the principal customer for VIGIV has been the USG, specifically HHS. We are operating under a contract for the supply of VIGIV through early 2019 and anticipate negotiating a follow-on contract for the continued supply of VIGIV into the SNS.
 
Product Candidates
 
The chart below highlights our primary Antibody Therapeutics product candidates:
 

Product Candidate | Target Indication 
----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
FLU-IGIV Seasonal influenza therapeutic | Treatment of serious Influenza A infection in hospitalized patients.
ZIKV-IG Zika therapeutic | Prophylaxis for Zika infections in at risk populations. 

 
FLU-IGIV (NP025). We are utilizing our hyperimmune platform to develop NP025, a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic enriched with influenza antibodies for the treatment of serious illness caused by influenza A infection in hospitalized patients. Development of an influenza immune globulin product could address the significant public health burden for severe hospitalized influenza.  In 2017, a Phase 2 study was initiated as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose ranging study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical benefit of FLU-IGIV in a targeted hospitalized influenza patient population. This study is currently ongoing at multiple sites in North America with a target completion in 2019.
 
ZIKV-IG (NP024). ZIKV-IG is a sterile purified liquid immunoglobulin preparation containing a standardized amount of neutralizing antibody to Zika Virus. It is produced from plasma collected from healthy donors who have recovered from Zika infection (convalescent) and have high levels of neutralizing antibody for ZIKV; such collection is being done out of FDA licensed plasma collection establishments. The Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety of ZIKV-IG completed enrollment in 2018. Several non-clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate efficacy and safety of ZIKV-IG in collaboration with several academic partners who have received funding from NIAID and other agencies.
 
Our Antibody Therapeutics business unit also has other product candidates addressing PHTs, including viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by Filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg and Sudan), among others.

Marketing and Sales
 
Our product sales can be divided into two primary categories: i) sales to the U.S. Government; and ii) commercial sales.
 
Government Procurement
 
For our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives, Antibody Therapeutics and Devices business units, our largest customers are the USG and domestic non-government organizations. All three business units share a team of dedicated marketing and sales personnel. We intend to use a similar approach to the marketing and sales of other product candidates that we either successfully develop or acquire. In addition to domestic sales, we sell our products to allied foreign governments as well as non-governmental organizations in foreign jurisdictions. For our non-U.S. sales, we use a combination of our employees as well as third-party marketing distributors and representatives to sell our products in key international markets, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Rim. We anticipate engaging additional representatives as interest in countermeasures addressing PHTs increases outside the United States.
 
Our Contract Development and Manufacturing business unit is supported by a dedicated group of business development professionals qualified to represent the full spectrum of contract product development and manufacturing services that we offer.
 
Commercial Sales
 
NARCAN® Nasal Spray is sold commercially through physician directed or standing order prescriptions at retail pharmacies.
 
Vivotif and Vaxchora are vaccines intended for use by travelers heading to regions where there is a risk of exposure to certain infectious diseases and therefore are sold to channels that address travel health. We sell to both wholesalers and distributors as well as directly to healthcare practitioners. The primary commercial customers of Vivotif and Vaxchora are private travel clinics, retail pharmacies and integrated hospital networks.
Competition
 
Our products and product candidates intended for the treatment or prevention of CBRNE, EID threats, travelers’ diseases and opioids face significant competition. Our products and any product or product candidate that we acquire or successfully develop and commercialize are likely to compete with current products and product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:

§ | BioThrax and NuThrax. BioThrax is the only vaccine licensed by the FDA for the prevention of anthrax disease. However, we face potential future competition for the supply of anthrax vaccines to the USG if such products are approved. Altimmune, Inc., Pfenex Inc., Soligenix, Inc., Immunovaccine Inc. and NanoBio Corporation are each currently developing anthrax vaccine product candidates. The majority of these product candidates are in Phase 2 and we will continue to monitor the competitive landscape as we move NuThrax into Phase 3 and through to licensure. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | NARCAN® (naloxone HCl) Nasal Spray. With respect to NARCAN® Nasal Spray, we face competition from injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. competes with NARCAN® Nasal Spray with their naloxone injection product. Kaléo competes with NARCAN® Nasal Spray with their auto-injector known as EVZIO™ (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-Injector. In 2016, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (“Teva”) filed, and in 2018 Perrigo UK FINCO Limited Partnership (“Perrigo”), filed Abbreiviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs,” each an “ANDA”) with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN® Nasal Spray. Although NARCAN® Nasal Spray was the first FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses and has advantages over certain other treatments, we expect the treatment to face additional competition. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | ACAM2000. ACAM2000 is the only FDA-licensed approved smallpox vaccine in the United States. Investigational stage competitor vaccine Imvamune® of Bavarian Nordic may be used in a smallpox emergency under the appropriate regulatory mechanism (i.e., IND or EUA). Imvamune is approved in Canada and in the European Union where it is marketed under the trade name Imvanex®. It was designed for use in people for whom replicating smallpox vaccines are contraindicated and is indicated for use in immunocompromised patients, including HIV-infected individuals and those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. A BLA was submitted by Bavarian Nordic to the FDA in October 2018. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | raxibacumab and Anthrasil. Raxibacumab is the first FDA licensed fully human anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic and Anthrasil is the only polyclonal antibody therapeutic licensed by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of toxemia resulting from inhalational anthrax. However, Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. has obtained FDA licensure for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) injection, indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | BAT. Our botulinum antitoxin immune globulin product is the only heptavalent therapeutic licensed approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of botulism and has orphan drug designation. Other companies may be developing therapies aimed at treating or preventing botulism infections, however, direct competition is currently limited. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | VIGIV. Our VIGIV product is the only therapeutic licensed approved by the FDA and Health Canada to address adverse events from smallpox vaccination with ACAM2000. Other companies may be developing therapies aimed at treating or preventing vaccinia infections; however, direct competition is currently limited. SIGA Technologies, Inc. is developing Tecovirimat (Arestvyr™, ST-26), an oral therapy that targets orthopox viruses such as vaccinia and potentially smallpox. Chimerix is also developing brincidofovir, a nucleotide analog lipid conjugate for treatment of smallpox. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | RSDL. In the United States, the RSDL Kit is the only medical device cleared by the FDA to remove or neutralize chemical warfare agents and T-2 toxin from the skin. Internationally, various Ministries of Defense have procured Fullers Earth, Dutch Powder and French Powder as a preparedness countermeasure for the decontamination of liquid chemical weapons from the skin. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Vivotif®. Vivotif is the only licensed FDA-approved oral typhoid vaccine globally. In the markets where Vivotif is licensed, it competes with Sanofi Pasteur’s Typhim VI® vaccine, an injectable polysaccharide typhoid vaccine. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Vaxchora®. In the United States, Vaxchora is the only FDA-licensed approved vaccine available indicated to prevent cholera. Dukoral®, an injectable cholera vaccine manufactured by Valneva, is available outside of the U.S. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Trobigard. Trobigard auto-injector delivers obidoxime chloride and atropine sulfate for emergency treatment of organophosphate nerve agent or insecticide poisoning. Meridian Medical Technologies, a subsidiary of Pfizer, is currently the sole owner of FDA-approved nerve agent antidote auto-injector devices to the USG and many international allied governments. Internationally, the remaining market is fragmented and served by regional or national-based defense product manufacturers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Contract Development and Manufacturing Services Business. We compete for contract manufacturing service business with a number of biopharmaceutical product development organizations, contract manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products and university research laboratories, including, among others: Lonza Group Ltd., OSO BioPharmaceuticals Manufacturing, LLC, Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc., Jubilant Hollister-Stier Laboratories LLC (a subsidiary of Jubilant Life Sciences Limited), Patheon Inc., Hospira Inc., Ajinomoto Althea, Inc.

Geographical Reliance
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our product sales revenue from U.S. customers as a percentage of total revenues were 73%, 67% and 58%, respectively.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
Our Lansing, Michigan site is a vertically integrated manufacturing campus and the location of our BioThrax manufacturing and NuThrax development operations. Located within the Lansing site is Building 55, our large-scale manufacturing facility, which was licensed by the FDA in August 2016 for the manufacture of BioThrax. This facility has the potential to manufacture up to 20 to 25 million doses of BioThrax annually on a single manufacturing train and has the physical footprint to add an additional manufacturing train, if needed. The manufacturing capabilities of Building 55 are central to our Vaccines and Anti-Infectives business unit. Our Lansing site also comprises biologics bulk product manufacturing capability (large- and small-scale), which we market to Contract Development and Manufacturing customers.
 
Our manufacturing facilities located at our Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, site are actively engaged in plasma-derived hyperimmune therapeutics manufacturing, chromatography-based plasma fractionation, downstream processing, aseptic filling, packaging and warehousing, quality assurance and control, and include development laboratories and office space. At these facilities, we manufacture and fill our hyperimmune specialty plasma products, including Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, and we conduct bulk manufacture our RSDL lotion. At these facilities, we also manufacture other hyperimmune products for contract manufacturing customers. The facilities at this site will play a key role in executing both product development and manufacturing activities in support of our Antibody Therapeutics and Contract Development and Manufacturing business units.
 
Our primary contract fill/finish services manufacturing site is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our “Camden Site.” The Camden Site provides pharmaceutical product development and filling services for injectable and other sterile products, as well as process design, technical transfer, manufacturing validations, laboratory support, aseptic filling, lyophilization, final packaging and accelerated and ongoing stability studies support. This facility is an approved manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East as well as various other countries. The facility includes warehousing space used for cold-storage and freezer capacity to support contract manufacturing customers. Additionally, we intend for this facility to provide fill/finish services to many of our business units for our development and commercial-stage products and product candidates.
 
Our manufacturing facility focused on disposable manufacturing for viral and non-viral products is located in Baltimore, Maryland, and is referred to as our “Bayview Site.” This facility is designed to take advantage of single-use bioreactor technology and to be capable of manufacturing several different products, including products derived from cell culture or microbial systems. In June 2012, we entered into a contract with BARDA, which established our Bayview Site as a CIADM. In May 2017 we completed work to expand this facility to double its original size to meet the needs of our customers. The facility is one of three centers designated by HHS to provide advanced development and manufacturing of MCMs to support the USG’s national security and public health emergency needs. This facility has also been and will continue to be marketed to non-USG clients in need of bulk manufacturing services. We are currently in the process of pursuing FDA licensure for the transfer of bulk manufacturing of raxibacumab to our Bayview facility.
 
We also currently lease a packaging facility in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, at the University of Southern Mississippi’s Accelerator, a technology innovation and commercialization center. This facility is equipped to package RSDL. RSDL bulk lotion that is manufactured in Winnipeg is shipped to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, for combination with RSDL sponges, which are further manufactured, packaged and then released for sale. All RSDL packets are packaged at this facility.
 
In October 2017, in connection with our acquisition of the ACAM2000 business from Sanofi, we acquired a live viral manufacturing facility and a leased office and warehouse space, both in Canton, Massachusetts, and a leased cGMP live viral fill/finish facility in Rockville, Maryland. Our Rockville facility is an FDA-licensed manufacturing facility under the regulatory regimes of the United States, Australia and Singapore. In November 2017, we received FDA approval of our supplemental BLA for the transfer of the upstream portion of the manufacturing process of ACAM2000 to our live viral manufacturing facility in Canton, Massachusetts.
 
In October 2018, in connection with our acquisition of PaxVax, we acquired a live viral manufacturing facility located in Bern, Switzerland and a fill/finish facility located in San Diego, California.
 
Supplies and Raw Materials
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to manufacture some of the supplies we require for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as supplies and raw materials used in the production of our products. Typically, we acquire these supplies and raw materials on a purchase order basis and, when possible, in quantities we believe adequate to meet our needs. We obtain Alhydrogel® adjuvant 2%, used to manufacture BioThrax and NuThrax, from a single-source supplier for which we have no alternative source of supply. However, we maintain stored supplies of this adjuvant sufficient to meet our expected manufacturing needs for these products. We also utilize single-source suppliers for other raw materials in our manufacturing processes.
 
We utilize single source suppliers for all components of NARCAN® Nasal Spray.  It is manufactured by a third party, which operates a full service offering from formulation to final packaging. Materials for production of NARCAN® Nasal Spray, such as Naloxone API and other excipients, along with the vial, stopper and device are produced around the world by other third parties and delivered to the primary manufacturer and released to manufacturing following appropriate testing. 
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property that arises from our activities. It is our policy to respect the intellectual property rights of others. In general, and where practicable, we pursue patent protection for new and innovative processes and products that we develop. The duration of and the type of protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions or administrative term adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patents. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect certain intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets rather than apply for patent protection, which requires disclosure of the proprietary information to the public. We take a number of measures to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, including entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties. In general, and where practicable, we also pursue registered trademarks for our products and product candidates. We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, trademarks, and other intellectual property. We enter into these agreements to augment our own intellectual property and to secure freedom to operate where necessary. These agreements sometimes impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of agreements in the future.
REGULATION
 
Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
 
Government Contracting
 
Our status as a USG contractor means that we are subject to various statutes and regulations, including:
 
  
§ | the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to FAR, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of government contracts; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (“DFARs”) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to DFARs, which comprehensively regulate the award, formation, administration and performance of DoD government contracts; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (“DOSAR”) which regulates the relationship between a Department of State organization and a contractor or potential contractor;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | export and import control laws and regulations, including but not limited to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



USG agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. These regulations can impose stricter penalties than those normally applicable to commercial contracts, such as criminal and civil liability and suspension and debarment from future government contracting. In addition, pursuant to various regulations, our government contracts can be subject to unilateral termination or modification by the government for convenience, detailed auditing and accounting systems requirements, statutorily controlled pricing, sourcing and subcontracting restrictions and statutorily mandated processes for adjudicating contract disputes.
 
Project BioShield. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (“Project BioShield”) provides expedited procedures for bioterrorism-related procurement and the awarding of research grants, making it easier for HHS to rapidly commit funds to countermeasure projects. Project BioShield relaxes procedures under the FAR for procuring property or services used in performing, administering or supporting biomedical countermeasure research and development. In addition, if the Secretary of HHS deems that there is a pressing need, Project BioShield authorizes the Secretary to use an expedited award process, rather than the normal peer review process, for grants, contracts and cooperative agreements related to biomedical countermeasure research and development activity. Under Project BioShield, in limited specified circumstances, HHS can contract to purchase unapproved countermeasures for the SNS and authorize the emergency use of medical products that have not yet been approved by the FDA.
 
First Responders Act. The First Responder Anthrax Preparedness Act of 2016 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS, to establish a pilot program to provide short-dated vaccines from the SNS to emergency response providers on a voluntary basis.
 
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (“PREP Act”) was signed into law in December 2005. The PREP Act creates liability protection for manufacturers of biodefense countermeasures when the Secretary of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. A PREP Act declaration is intended to provide liability protection from claims under federal or state law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure under a government contract. The Secretary of HHS has issued PREP Act declarations identifying BioThrax, ACAM2000, raxibacumab, Anthrasil, BAT and VIGIV, as covered countermeasures. These declarations expire in 2022. Manufacturers are not entitled to protection under the PREP Act in cases of willful misconduct and, accordingly, the PREP Act may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
 
Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002. The Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technology Act of 2002 (“SAFETY Act”) is intended to create product liability limitations for qualifying anti-terrorism technologies for claims arising from or related to an act of terrorism. Certain of our products, namely BioThrax and RSDL, are certified anti-terrorism products covered under the protections of the SAFETY Act. Although we are covered by the benefits of the SAFETY Act for BioThrax and RSDL, the SAFETY Act may not provide adequate protection from all claims made against us.
 
Product Development for Therapeutics and Vaccines
 
Pre-Clinical Testing. Before beginning testing of compounds in human subjects in the United States, stringent government requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing generally includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. We generally perform pre-clinical safety and efficacy testing on our product candidates before we initiate clinical trials.
 
Animal Rule. For product candidates that are intended to treat or prevent infection from rare life-threatening diseases, conducting controlled clinical trials with human patients to determine efficacy may be unethical or unfeasible. Under regulations issued by the FDA in 2002, often referred to as the “Animal Rule,” under some circumstances, approval of such product candidates can be based on clinical data from trials in healthy subjects that demonstrate adequate safety and immunogenicity as well as efficacy data from adequate and well-controlled animal studies. Among other requirements, the animal studies must establish that the drug or biological product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans. Because the FDA must agree that data derived from animal studies may be extrapolated to establish safety and efficacy in humans, these studies add complexity and uncertainty to the testing and approval process. In addition, products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements, including post-marketing study requirements, restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients.
 
Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The sponsor must also include an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation. The pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day period.
 
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials generally involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. In certain cases, described below, animal studies may be used in place of human studies. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and trial designs vary depending on the Therapeutic or Prophylactic nature of the product. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
  
§ | Phase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 2 clinical trials involve a small number of patients with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 3 clinical trials consist of expanded, larger-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product candidate using a specific dosing regimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA approval of the product candidate. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Phase 4 clinical trials are sometimes conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, including to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific patient population. As part of a product approval, the FDA may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are sometimes called post-marketing commitment studies, be conducted post-approval. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Good Clinical Practice. All phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected.
 
Marketing Approval – Biologics, Drugs and Vaccines
 
Biologics License Application/New Drug Application. For large molecule products, including products such as vaccines, products derived from blood and blood components, and antibodies and other recombinant proteins, all data obtained from a development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a BLA to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. For small molecule drugs, this information is submitted in a new drug application (“NDA”) filing. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. Once an application is accepted for filing, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) requires the FDA to review the application within 10 months of its 60-day filing date, although in practice, longer review times may occur.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”), BLAs, NDAs and certain supplements must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted.
 
In reviewing a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant approval, request more information or data, or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which approval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits of the product candidate as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug. The FDA may also significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a product.
 
Fast Track Designation. The FDA may designate a product as a fast track drug if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this disease or condition. Sponsors granted a fast track designation for a drug are granted more opportunities to interact with the FDA during the approval process and are eligible for FDA review of the application on a rolling basis, before the application has been completed. The FDA granted fast track status to NuThrax in June 2011 and to ZIKV-IG in December 2017.
 
Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug’’ in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. A manufacturer must request orphan drug designation prior to submitting a BLA or NDA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, reduced filing fees for marketing applications and a special seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved.
 
Our products with current orphan drug exclusivity in the United States include the following:
 
  
§ | BioThrax for post-exposure prophylaxis of disease following suspected or confirmed B. anthracis exposure, when administered in conjunction with recommended antibacterial drugs, with exclusivity though November 2022;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | raxibacumab for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate, with exclusivity through December 2019; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Anthrasil for the treatment of toxemia associated with inhalational anthrax in adult and pediatric patients in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs, with exclusivity through March 2022; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | BAT for the treatment of suspected or documented exposure to botulinum neurotoxin A, B, C, D, E, F or G, with exclusivity through March 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Post-Approval Requirements. Any drug, biologic or medical device product for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, cGMPs and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA has post-approval authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if warranted by the appearance of new safety information. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their facility with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-label promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our products. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and promotion exist for products that have so-called “black box warnings” in their approved package inserts, such as Anthrasil and VIGIV in the United States.
 
Vaccine and Therapeutic Product Lot Release and FDA Review. Because the manufacturing process for biological products is complex, the FDA requires for many biologics, including most vaccines and immune globulin products, that each product lot undergo thorough testing for purity, potency, identity and sterility. All of our vaccines and immune globulin products are subject to lot release protocols by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. The length of the review process depends on a number of factors, including reviewer questions, license supplement approval, reviewer availability and whether our internal testing of product samples is completed before or concurrently with regulatory agency testing, if applicable.
 Priority Review Vouchers. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act added Section 524 to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and established the Neglected Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) program. This PRV program was expanded in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act to include rare pediatric diseases. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established a PRV program within the FDA for MCMs for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats, and those vaccines, therapeutics and MCMs, that prevent or treat material threat agents as identified in the Public Health Service Act. Under the PRV program, upon approval of a qualified product, companies receive a special voucher which allows them to have a drug reviewed under FDA’s priority review system, with the anticipation that it will accelerate the regulatory review to get the product to market more rapidly. Recipients of a PRV may transfer that voucher to another party for consideration.
 
Several of our investigational stage product candidates may be eligible for PRV under multiple PRV programs upon the product approval. We believe that ZIKV-IG (NP024), a human polyclonal antibody therapeutic being developed as a prophylaxis and treatment for Zika infections in at risk populations may have the potential for a PRV under the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program. We believe that the Chikungunya VLP vaccine, being developed for prevention of disease caused by chikungunya infections, may have the potential for a PRV under the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program and under the MCM PRV program. We also believe that rVSV-Quad, rVSV-Lassa, rVSV-Ebola, rVSV-Marburg and rVSV-Sudan, the candidate viral hemorrhagic fever virus vaccines, may have potential for a PRV under either the Neglected Tropical Disease PRV program or the MCM PRV program. However, there can be no assurances that any of these candidates will obtain PRV status.
 
Marketing Approval – Devices
 
Devices may fall within the definition of a Medical Device or may be a Combination Product including both a device for delivery of a drug product and the drug product itself. Medical Devices are also subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive regulation under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. The RSDL Kit is regulated as a non-restricted Class II medical device. Our Trobigard auto-injector product is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA or any similar regulatory body and is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the United States. This product is not distributed in the United States.

§ | Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls. These general controls include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which sets forth requirements for manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse medical events, labeling and promotion only for cleared or approved intended uses. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Class II devices are also subject to these general controls and to any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k)-pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device approved by the FDA after May 28, 1976. This previously-cleared device is called the predicate device. If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. If a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that was cleared prior to May 28, 1976, the proposed device is cleared based on a pre-amendment and is cleared as an unclassified device. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | A Class III device requires approval of a pre-market application (“PMA”) which is an expensive, lengthy and uncertain process requiring many years to complete. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”). An IDE must be supported by pre-clinical data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reports of adverse events, labeling and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use. If the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions, including:
 
§  fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
 §  recall or seizure of products;
 §  operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 §  refusal of requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products;
 §  withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and
 §  criminal prosecution.
 
The FDA also has the authority to require repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device. The FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA approval are subject to FDA export requirements.
 
Combination Products, of the type described above, are subject to the BLA/NDA regulatory regime. Our Trobigard auto-injector is a combination product and is not currently approved or cleared by the FDA or any similar regulatory body and is only distributed to authorized government buyers for use outside the United States. This product is not distributed in the United States.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications and Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA for innovator products, or an ANDA for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require a demonstration of safety and efficacy of generic products. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the API is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data.
 
The third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for certain label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States and Canada as well as select foreign countries. We intend to further expand our commercial presence to additional foreign countries and territories. In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a process similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the European Union (“EU”) Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). Additionally, each foreign country subjects medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union, a harmonized medical device directive legislates approval requirements. Within this framework, the CE Mark, an attestation of conformity with the essential health, safety and environmental requirements and compliance with relevant European Union legislation, allows for the legal marketing of the product in all European Economic Area member states. Additionally, to the extent that a product is marketed outside of the United States, a facility may also be registered with applicable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities, who may also require inspections for compliance with local marketing regulations.
 
Anti-Corruption Laws
 
As part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs are required to publicly report payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. This information is posted on a public website. Failure to timely and accurately submit required information could subject us to civil penalties.
 
Our operations are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by the activities of our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to bribery activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries.
 
Other Industry Regulation
 
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to the use of data, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents used in connection with our product development, are or may be applicable to our activities.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of February 15, 2019, we had 1,705 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
