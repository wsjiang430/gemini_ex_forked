ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
Overview
 
Max Sound Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2005 as 43010, Inc. to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, locating and negotiating with a business entity for combination in the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. The total of 100,000 shares represents 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock at the time of the transfer. As a result, Mr. Halpern became our sole shareholder. As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Michael Raleigh, our then President, CEO, CFO, and Chairman resigned from all the positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO CFO and Chairman. The original business model was developed by Mr. Halpern in September of 2008 and began when he joined the Company on October 7, 2008. In October 2008, we became a development stage company focused on creating an Internet search engine and networking web site. 
 
From October 2008 until January 17, 2011, Mr. Halpern was our CEO, and during that time the Company was focused on developing their Internet search engine and networking web site. In January of 2010, the
  Company launched their Internet search engine and networking website.  In 2011, the Company decided to abandon its social networking website.  On May 11, 2010, the Company acquired the worldwide rights, title, and interest to all fields of use for MAX-D.
 
On January 17, 2011, Mr. Halpern resigned as the Company’s CEO and John Blaisure was appointed as CEO.  In February of 2011, the Company elected to change its business operations and focus primarily on developing and launching the MAX-D technology.  Our current website (maxd.audio) is used to showcase the MAX-D technology.  On March 8, 2011, the Company changed its name to Max Sound Corporation, and its trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board to MAXD.
 
Max Sound Corporation owns the worldwide rights to all fields of use to MAX-D HD Audio, which was invented by Lloyd Trammell, a top sound designer and audio engineer who helped develop and sell the first working Surround Sound System to Hughes Aircraft.  Mr.Trammell, also developed MIDI for Korg.  We believe that MAX-D is to Audio what High Definition is to Video.  MAX-D works by converting all audio files to their highest possible acoustically perfect equivalent without increasing files size or bandwidth usage.
 
No later than June 20, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with VSL Communications, Inc., making MAXD the exclusive agent to VSL to enforce all rights with respect to patented technology owned and controlled by VSL. In particular, the Company announced that it had acquired a worldwide license and representation rights to a patented video and data technology “Optimized Data Transmission System and Method” (ODT) which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only 3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represents thirty three times reduction associated with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be viewed by an end-user. As described more fully in the Legal Proceedings Section, The Company has since filed suit against Google, Inc., YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., alleging willful infringement of the patent.
 
On August 11, 2014, the Company and VSL simultaneously filed trade secret and patent infringement actions against Google, Inc., and its subsidiaries YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., relating to proprietary and patented technology owned by Vedanti Systems Limited (“Vedanti”), a subsidiary of VSL.  The patent infringement complaint was originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware; the trade secret suit was filed in Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.  On September 30, 2014, the Company filed notices of voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to both lawsuits. On October 1, 2014, the Company amended the patent complaint and filed it in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In this patent lawsuit, the Company contends that, in 2010, while Google was in discussions with Vedanti about the possibility of acquiring Vedanti's patented digital video streaming techniques and other proprietary methods, Google gained access to and received technical guidance regarding Vedanti’s proprietary codec, a computer program capable of encoding and decoding a digital data stream or signal.  The lawsuit further alleges that soon after Google and Vedanti initiated negotiations, Google willfully infringed Vedanti's patent by incorporating Vedanti's patented technology into Google's own VP8, VP9, WebM, YouTube, Google Adsense, Google Play, Google TV, Chromebook, Google Drive, Google Chromecast, Google Play-per-view, Google Glasses, Google+, Google’s Simplify, Google Maps, and Google Earth, without compensating Vedanti for such use.  On May 13, 2015 Google's “motion to dismiss” was denied by the Northern District of California court in a seven page order, stating that Max Sound had sufficiently alleged the existence and validity of the '339 Patent.  However, on November 24, 2015, the court granted a second motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the defendants’ argument that the agreements between the Company and VSL/Vedanti did not clearly give the Company standing to enforce the patent rights.  The Company appealed that decision on February 22, 2016. One January 18, 2017 the Company received a notice from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals that affirmed the order of the District Court dismissing MAXD's patent infringement lawsuit against Google for lack of standing. The Court did not issue a written decision explaining its reasoning or that the Company's arguments were not correct; however, the Company believes that their decision was predicated on the fact that as now co-owners of the patents with Vedanti, the Company can simply re-file together against Google. The Court also issued an order denying Google's motion arguing that the Company's appeal should be dismissed as moot.  On September 25, 2017, the Court issued an order that the
  Company should reimburse defendants for its attorneys’ fees in the amount of $820,321.41 The Company was informed by counsel that the Order for fees was without merit and appealed but was told at the hearing that Google would lose the appeal if the Company had not committed Waiver. After an excessively long delay by the Federal Appeals Court to hear the case so it could be combined with another case (Vedanti Licensing Limited vs Google) using the same Tribunal with the sole intention to harm the Company, and continue to allow Google to steal and destroy the ODT Patent while profiting from it as a key component of its business, the Appeal was finally heard and the Company lost with no reasonable explanation with the corrupt Tribunal simply rubber stamping both cases Affirmed See Fed Rule 36, which means “we won’t even look at the facts because then we would have no choice but to reverse the case.” The Company is exploring additional rights it may have in both cases with its ongoing battle against Judicial Corruption. The Company is taking recourse by planning to file a petition for rehearing en banc, where all judges of the appellate court will hear the case. This petition is based on a precedent case similar to Max Sound’s case with the same defense lawyer for the opposing side, the same judges who heard the case and a similar chain of events. Max Sound has until April 11, 2019 to file the petition. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded the judgement payable on the balance sheet.
 
In connection with the dismissal of the aforementioned litigation, the Company initiated an arbitration against VSL Communications, Ltd., Vedanti Systems, Ltd., Constance Nash, Robert Newell and eTech Investments as respondents before the American Arbitration Association for breach of contract, fraud, and other causes of action. Subsequently, the Company is pursuing in arbitration claims against VSL to enforce the agreement and to compel VSL to comply with the agreement’s terms and conditions that inter alia VSL must fully cooperate with the Company to cure any issues the Court raised with standing to pursue the claims. On January 17, 2017 the AAA notified the Company’s counsel that the respondent’s counterclaim was withdrawn this arbitration claim was formally concluded.
 
On November 29, 2016, MAXD announced that it entered into an agreement with Vedanti Systems Limited and Vedanti Licensing Limited (VLL) that resolves their dispute over the international Optimized Data Transmission (ODT) patent portfolio previously owned by Vedanti. The agreement further provides that VLL and MAXD will become co-owners of the pioneering portfolio.
 
On December 20, 2016 Companies House, the United Kingdom's registrar of companies, notified the Company that VSL Communications Limited was dissolved, thereafter voiding any remaining agreement with VSL Communications or its previous Officers, Directors or Management.
 
On May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia’s intellectual property rights. While Eli Attia was teaching his invention at Google [x], the project was internally valued by Google at $120 Billion USD a year. Since then, Flux has since been spun-out of Google [x], funded and has quickly growing, upon information and belief, to over 800 employees according to one of its founders. MAXD, on behalf of Attia’s, have since filed suit against Google, Inc., Flux Factory, and various executives of these companies for misappropriation of trade secrets. Since this time, the Company has advanced the case(s) and has signed additional agreements with the inventor as late as February 21st, 2017. On March 1, 2017, at Google's request, Max Sound Management met with Google Representatives to mediate the Attia matter. At the end of the day, no settlement agreement was reached and Max Sound agreed to leave the mediation negotiations open while the case continues.
 
On December 5, 2014, the Company, along with renowned architect Eli Attia, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, against Google, its co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google’s spinoff company Flux Factory, and senior executives of Flux. Plaintiffs’ allege misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract and other contract-related claims, breach of confidence, slander of title, violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law (California Business and Professionals Code §§ 17200 et seq.), and fraud, and also a claim for declaratory relief. The lawsuit contends that Google and the other Defendants stole Mr. Attia’s trade secrets, proprietary information, and know-how regarding a revolutionary architecture design and building process that he alone had invented, known as Engineered Architecture. Defendants are alleged to have engaged Mr. Attia in 2010 and 2011 to translate his architectural technology into software for a proof of concept, with the goal of determining at
  that point whether to continue with full-scale development with Mr. Attia. Instead, the lawsuit claims that once Mr. Attia had disclosed the trade secrets and proprietary information Defendants needed to bring the technology to market, they severed ties with Mr. Attia, and continued to use his technology without a license and without compensation, in order to bring the technology to market themselves. Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against Google, damages (including punitive damages), and restitution. As exclusive agent to Eli Attia to enforce all rights with respect to the subject technology, the Company has retained Buether Joe & Carpenter LLC to represent the Company in the suit, on a contingency fee basis. The case will be vigorously prosecuted, and the Company believes it has a good likelihood of success.  Defendants have filed multiple demurrers to the complaint, and the Court has issued orders allowing the case to proceed.  Defendants filed another demurrer on March 17, 2016, which was denied by the Court on August 12, 2016.  On October 4, 2017, the Court granted Mr. Attia leave to amend the complaint to add causes of action against defendants for civil violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (commonly known as RICO).  Subsequently, on October 23, 2017, the defendants removed the lawsuit from California state court to the federal district court in the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. In February 2019, that court gave a dismissal without prejudice, and the virtue of an appeal is being considered going forward.
 


Description of Our Business                                                                           
 
Max Sound (MAX-D) is engaged in activities to sell and license products and services based on its patent-pending MAX-D HD Audio Technology for sound recording and playback that dramatically improves the listener’s experience. The MAX-D HD Audio Technology delivers high definition audio without increasing file size. 
 
The Company is marketing MAX-D on the basis that it is to audio what HD is to video.  MAX-D technology improves all types of audio; moreover, it is intended to be particularly valuable in improving the ever-growing use of compressed audio and video as used in mp3 files, iPods, internet, and satellite/terrestrial broadcasting.  For example, a listener using a portable mp3 player with MAX-D will experience sound quality that is comparable to the original CD before it was converted into an mp3 file.  In another example, cell phone users using a cell phone equipped with MAX-D will hear the other person's voice as if they are speaking directly in front of them. The Company believes that the MAX-D HD is better for a consumers hearing than today’s highly compressed audio and anticipate that continued research and development will support the Company’s position. In numerous consumer audio tests, MAX-D HD sounded better to consumers than high-resolution WAV files. Importantly, MAX-D HD remains one tenth the size of a WAV file, and in the Company’s opinion offers more clarity, dimension, articulation and impact in every range of the audio spectrum to the listener. The Company’s current business model is to license the technology to content creators, manufacturers, and network broadcasters.  The Company’s patent-pending technology stands customer ready today.  The Company’s market pursuits include motion picture, music recording, video game, broadcasting, internet video and audio, automobile infotainment systems and consumer electronics. 
 
The Company maintains an efficient staff of four, including employees and sub-contractors, which has established business relationships with the leading companies in the Smartphone, Tablet, Chip, Music and Consumer Retail business. The Company is executing its “Go To Market” strategy and sales programs to solve the degraded compressed audio issues plaguing the audio currently being consumed. These companies dominate the multi-media and electronics technology arena providing audio delivery across all channels of the exploding smartphone tablet device phenomenon.
 
Qualcomm
 
The Company is currently working under its existing license with Qualcomm to implement onto the 600 and 700series Snap Dragon chip series and is completing an application that improves voice transmission on mobile devices and has great potential as a revenue share arrangement with many Qualcomm OEM’s by providing a better experience to consumers and a competitive marketing advantage globally.  The license agreement is automatically renewable for one-year periods unless terminated by either party with 30 days prior written notice. The Company believes MAXD Voice will be ready for product demonstration in Q2 and is working with related retailers to deliver a newly branded series of MAX-D portable blue tooth speakers, ear buds and head phones with projected Q2 launch.
Optimized Data Transmission (ODT)
 
In November 2016, MAXD announced that it entered into an agreement with Vedanti Systems Limited and Vedanti Licensing Limited (VLL), which provides that VLL and MAXD will become co-owners of the pioneering ODT portfolio.
 
Becoming co-owners of this portfolio was a major milestone for the Company, as it carries numerous positive implications for the Company going forward. First, it solidifies our highly positive relationship with Vedanti and ends our legal standing issues. Second, we were able to drop our litigations and arbitrations against each other saving both companies potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. Finally, as co-owners we're able to work together on existing business opportunities and jointly implement strategies for monetizing the ODT patents here in the United States and around the world.

About MAX-D HD Audio:
 
The MAX-D software improves the sound heard from any device. Consumers have unknowingly sacrificed better audio quality for portable convenience and MAX-D rectifies this problem by: analyzing what content is missing from the compressed audio signal; dynamically resynthesizing lost harmonics and natural sound fields in real time; maximizing the output potential of any device without increasing original file size; and without requiring consumers or OEM’s to change equipment or infrastructure.
 


MAX-D Benefits:Increases dynamic range, eliminates destructive effects of audio compression with no increase in file size or transmission bandwidth; High-resolution audio reproduction with an omni-directional sound field using only two speakers; “Real” three-dimensional sound field, versus artificial sound field created by competing technologies; and More realistic “live performance” quality of all recordings with optimal dynamic range, bass response and overall clarity.

The Chip is being designed to be imbedded into TV Receivers, Digital Projection TVs, LCD TVs, Plasma TVs, Component DVD Players/Recorders, DVD Recorders, Set-Top Boxes, Personal Video Recorders (PVRs), Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) Receivers, Personal Computers, Satellite Radio Receivers, Mobile Video Devices, Domestic Factory Installed Auto Sound, Camcorders, MP3 Players, Electronic Gaming Hardware, Wireless Telephones, Cell Phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs).
 
MAX-D Dynamic Software Module: Max Sound has delivered and is working to implement an application programming interface (“API”)for all Internet applications to process all audio/video content streamed or downloaded by consumers. Viable target candidates within the next 24 months include streaming movie and music services. Companies selling downloaded MP3’s are also expected to find immense value in our technology due to their dominance in web-based audio and video. This Module is a lossless dynamic process requiring no destructive encoding or decoding and needs no additional hardware or critical monitoring stage after processing.  In addition, no specialized decoder is necessary on any audio system.
 
Technology
 
MAX-D is a unique approach to processing sound, based on the physics of acoustics rather than electronics. Remarkably simple to deploy, MAX-D is a technology that dramatically raises the standard for sound quality, with no corresponding increase in file size or transmission channel bandwidth.   This is accomplished by processing audio with our proprietary, patent-pending process. This embedded and duplicating format either remains the same, or can be converted to whatever format the user desires, while retaining unparalleled fidelity and dynamic range.
 
MAX-D restores the original recorded acoustical space in any listening environment. MAX-D is the only technology that both aligns phase and corrects phase distortion in a completed recording. MAX-D supplies missing audio content by adding acoustics and frequency response lost in the original recording or in the compression and transmission processes. MAX-D corrects and optimizes harmonic content and low frequency responses, greatly enhancing acoustic accuracy and we believe reduces ear fatigue.
 MAX-D integrates time, phase, harmonics, dynamics, and sub-harmonic region optimizations in a fully dynamic fashion. MAX-D is a lossless dynamic process, requiring no destructive encoding/decoding process, or any specialized decoder at all. MAX-D needs no additional hardware or critical monitoring stage after processing.   The end result is that every aspect of audio processed with MAX-D  - voice, instrument, or special effects - sounds refreshingly clear, realistic, and natural. The MAX-D HD Audio Technology creates an optimum sound field throughout every listening environment – from the corners of a theater; on your living room couch; to the back seat of your car.
 
MAX-D HD Audio Technology requires no equipment changeover and can be embedded into any product (e.g. speakers, headphones, mobile devices), or online content delivery systems (e.g. streaming, cable, video games) to provide better sounding audio.
 
Market
 
MAX-D products and services are designed and intended to solve problems and add value to audio components of several separate industries, including consumer electronics, motion picture, broadcasting, video game, recording, cell phone, internet, and VOIP applications.
Competition
 
The Company’s management believes there are no current competitors capable of delivering the high quality of audio products and services produced by the company. Although other companies, like DTS or
Dolby, have technologies that enhance sound; we do not believe these technologies negatively affect the Company because the MAX-D process can enhance the other audio company’s technology.
 
We believe we will be considered friendly competition in the future for three reasons; (1) we believe that MAX-D technology delivers the best sound quality available today, (2) MAX-D does not require any additional equipment; and (3) MAX-D makes any competition’s audio processes sound better.
