ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
We are engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of the hormone cortisol. Elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol are implicated in many diseases.
Our first approved product, Korlym, treats patients with Cushing’s syndrome, a rare disease that is caused by excess cortisol activity. The active ingredient in Korlym is mifepristone, a compound that modulates cortisol activity by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (“GR”), one of the body’s two cortisol receptors. We first made Korlym available to patients commercially in April 2012. 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Korlym in February 2012 as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. 
We have discovered and patented three structurally distinct series of proprietary, selective cortisol modulators, all of which share mifepristone’s affinity for GR but, unlike mifepristone, do not bind to the progesterone receptor (“PR”) and therefore do not cause effects arising from antagonism of progesterone activity, such as termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. We are conducting clinical trials of three of these compounds, including: (i) a Phase 3 trial of 
1

relacorilant to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome; (ii) a Phase 2, controlled study of relacorilant combined with Celgene Corporation’s drug Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) to treat patients with metastatic ovarian cancer; (iii) a Phase 1/2 trial of relacorilant plus Abraxane to treat patients with a variety of solid tumors; and (iv) a Phase 1/2 trial of CORT125281 combined with Pfizer Inc.’s androgen receptor antagonist Xtandi® (enzalutamide) to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). We plan to open placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trials of CORT118335 as a potential treatment for two diseases - non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
The Role of Cortisol in Disease
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that plays a significant role in the way the body reacts to stress. It is essential for survival. Cortisol influences metabolism and the immune system and contributes to emotional stability. Cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm that is essential to health, peaking upon awakening and decreasing during the day.   Insufficient cortisol activity may lead to dehydration, hypotension, shock, fatigue and hypoglycemia. Excessive cortisol activity - known as hypercortisolism - may lead to a suppressed immune response, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, depressed mood, psychosis, wasting of the arms and legs, edema, fatigue, hypertension and other problems. Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that cortisol reduces a patient’s immune response to oncogenesis, shields certain cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy and facilitates the growth of others. 
The challenge in treating a patient with hypercortisolism is modulating cortisol’s effects without suppressing them below normal levels or disrupting cortisol’s normal diurnal rhythm. Simply reducing or destroying the ability of the body to make cortisol can cause serious harm. Cortisol activity can be modulated effectively by a drug that competes with cortisol as it attempts to bind to GR. Mifepristone, the active ingredient in Korlym, is a competitive GR antagonist, as are our proprietary compounds.
Because mifepristone works by reducing the binding of excess cortisol to GR, it can modulate the effects of abnormal levels and release patterns of cortisol without compromising cortisol’s healthy functions and rhythms. However, mifepristone also binds to PR, thereby terminating pregnancy and causing other adverse effects, including vaginal bleeding (a debilitating condition suffered by a significant portion of women who take Korlym). Our proprietary selective cortisol modulators bind to GR as potently as mifepristone does, but have no affinity for PR and so do not cause PR-related side effects.
Cushing’s Syndrome
Background. Cushing’s syndrome is the clinical manifestation of hypercortisolism. An estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each year, resulting in approximately 3,000 new patients and about 20,000 patients with Cushing’s syndrome in the United States, approximately half of whom are cured by surgery. It most often affects adults between the ages of 20 and 50.  
Most people with Cushing’s syndrome have one or more of the following symptoms: high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing’s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated. The preferred treatment is surgery, which, if successful, can cure the disease. Depending on the type of tumor, surgery can result in a range of complications and has varying rates of success. In approximately half of the patients, surgery is not successful because the tumor cannot be located or removed completely. 
Korlym to Treat Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. We sell Korlym exclusively in the United States, using experienced sales representatives targeting the endocrinologists and other physicians who care for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Because many people who suffer from Cushing’s syndrome are undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate physicians and patients about diagnosis of this syndrome and the role cortisol modulators can play in treating the disease. In addition, we have a field-based force of medical science liaisons.
We use one specialty pharmacy and one specialty distributor to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support to physicians and patients. Our policy is that no patient with Cushing’s syndrome will be denied access to Korlym for financial reasons. To help us achieve that goal, we fund our own patient support programs and donate money to independent charitable foundations that help patients cover the cost of all aspects of their Cushing’s syndrome care, whether or not that care includes taking Korlym.
Relacorilant to Treat Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. We are advancing our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator, relacorilant, as a potential treatment for hypercortisolism. Patients in relacorilant’s Phase 2 trial exhibited clinically 
2

meaningful improvements in hyperglycemia and hypertension - two of Cushing syndrome’s most common and pernicious symptoms. Relacorilant shares Korlym’s affinity for GR, but unlike Korlym has no affinity for PR, and so does not cause the effects associated with PR affinity, including termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. In addition, in its Phase 2 trial, relacorilant did not cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels), a potentially serious adverse event that is a leading cause of patients discontinuing treatment with Korlym. Forty-four percent of patients in Korlym’s pivotal trial experienced hypokalemia.
We are currently conducting relacorilant’s Phase 3 trial, in which we expect to enroll 130 patients at 60 sites in the United States and Europe. Each patient will receive relacorilant for 22 weeks, at which time any who have demonstrated pre-specified, clinically-meaningful improvements in hypertension or glucose metabolism will enter a twelve-week, double-blind, “randomized withdrawal” phase, in which half of the patients will continue to receive relacorilant and the rest will receive placebo. The rate and degree of relapse in patients receiving placebo will be measured against the rate and degree of relapse in those continuing to receive the medicine.
Relacorilant has been designated an orphan drug for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome. See “Business - Orphan Drug Designation."
FKBP5 Gene Expression Assay. The tests available to physicians to diagnosis patients with hypercortisolism and optimize their treatment are imprecise and often fail to identify patients with less severe manifestations of the disease. We have developed an assay to measure expression of the gene FKBP5, which is stimulated by cortisol activity, and have completed analytical validation pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). Clinical data indicate that FKBP5 levels are high in patients suffering from hypercortisolism (i.e., excess cortisol activity), but subside when their hypercortisolism is successfully treated. We believe this assay will enable physicians to more easily identify new patients with hypercortisolism and better treat those already in their care.
Oncology
There is substantial in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence that cortisol’s activity allows certain solid tumors to resist treatment. In some cancers, cortisol activity promotes tumor growth. In other cancers, cortisol stimulates genes that retard cellular apoptosis. Cortisol also suppresses the body's immune response, which is often useful, as it lessens the frequency of autoimmune diseases. However, activating, not suppressing, the immune system is beneficial in fighting certain cancers. Adding a cortisol modulator to a treatment regimen may help the patient’s immune system combat the disease.  Many types of solid tumors express GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them pancreatic, ovarian, castration-resistant prostate, triple-negative breast, cervical and vulvar cancers, as well as sarcoma and melanoma. We own, or have exclusively licensed, several patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat pancreatic, cervical, breast, and prostate cancers. 
Relacorilant to Treat Patients with Metastatic Ovarian Cancer.  We are conducting a Phase 2, controlled trial of relacorilant in combination with Abraxane to treat patients with metastatic ovarian cancer. The trial is expected to enroll 180 patients at sites in the United States and Europe. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 100 mg of relacorilant plus 80 ng/m2 of Abraxane or 80 ng/m2 of Abraxane alone.
We initiated our Phase 2 trial in metastatic ovarian cancer because of promising early data generated by our Phase 1/2 open label study of relacorilant plus Abraxane to treat a wide variety of solid tumors. That trial continues to enroll patients. As we identify indications of clinical activity in particular tumor types, we will further test the combination’s efficacy and safety in expansion cohorts of approximately 20 patients or in separate, larger clinical trials. We have opened an expansion cohort in patients with pancreatic cancer and continue to explore opening cohorts in patients with other solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer and may initiate trials evaluating relacorilant with other cancer therapies, including immunotherapy.
Korlym to Treat Patients with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (“TNBC”). In December 2016, we announced the results of our Phase 1/2 trial of Korlym in combination with eribulin (Eisai Inc.’s drug, Halaven®) to treat patients with metastatic TNBC. The trial studied 21 patients with GR-positive tumors, one with GR-negative tumors and one with tumors whose GR status was not known. As determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”), efficacy results were as follows: four patients exhibited a partial response, defined as a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size; eight had stable disease; and 11 had progressive disease. Six patients achieved progression-free survival (“PFS”) longer than the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for PFS (15 weeks) in patients receiving Halaven® monotherapy in a comparable population (Aogi et al., Annals of Oncology 23: 1441-1448, 2012). Median PFS in the trial was 11.1 weeks - compared to 7.2 weeks in the Halaven monotherapy study reported by Aogi.

We believe the addition of Korlym to chemotherapy warrants further study. University of Chicago investigators are leading a 64-patient double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 2 trial of Korlym combined with Abraxane to treat patients with TNBC. Celgene is funding the trial. University of Chicago investigators are also conducting a 74-patient, open label trial of Korlym combined with Merck’s drug Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced HER2-negative and triple-negative breast cancer. Merck is funding the trial. We are providing Korlym to both trials.
Cortisol Modulators to Treat Patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (“CRPC”). Because androgens stimulate prostate tumor growth, androgen deprivation is a common treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Tumors eventually escape androgen deprivation therapy through the proliferation of cells for which cortisol’s stimulation of GR and cortisol’s stimulation of mutated androgen receptors are primary growth factors. Combining a cortisol modulator with an androgen modulator such as Xtandi may block this escape route.
We have begun dosing patients at sites in the United States and Europe in an open label, Phase 1/2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator CORT125281 combined with Xtandi in patients with metastatic CRPC. 
University of Chicago investigators are leading an 84-patient, controlled, multicenter Phase 2 trial of Korlym combined with Xtandi to treat patients with metastatic CRPC. The Department of Defense and the Prostate Cancer Foundation are funding the trial. Pfizer is providing Xtandi. We are providing Korlym. These investigators are also conducting a dose-finding trial of relacorilant combined with Xtandi in patients with metastatic CRPC. We are providing relacorilant.
We have exclusively licensed patents from the University of Chicago covering the use of cortisol modulators combined with anticancer agents to treat TNBC and with androgen deprivation agents to treat CRPC. We also own two U.S. patents and two allowed patent applications covering the use of relacorilant and CORT125281 to treat pancreatic cancer.
Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain and NASH
In animal models, our proprietary selective cortisol modulator CORT118335 potently prevents and reverses the weight gain caused by Eli Lilly and Company’s antipsychotic medication Zyprexa® (olanzapine).  These findings replicate data from placebo-controlled clinical trials we conducted in which mifepristone significantly reduced the weight gain and adverse metabolic effects experienced by healthy subjects administered Zyprexa or Johnson & Johnson’s antipsychotic medication Risperdal® (risperidone). We published the results of these trials in the journals Advances in Therapy, Gross et al (2009) and Obesity, Gross et al (2010).
We plan to conduct three placebo-controlled trials of CORT118335 as a potential treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain.  The first trial will study whether CORT118335 prevents weight gain in healthy volunteers administered a two-week course of antipsychotic medication.  The second two trials will be in patients taking antipsychotic medications - one to study the reversal of recently-established weight gain and the other to study the reversal of long-standing weight gain.
CORT118335 also prevents and reverses non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver fibrosis in animal models.  We conducted these pre-clinical studies in response to data suggesting that cortisol modulation with Korlym played a role in reversing fatty liver disease in patients with hypercortisolism.  Fatty liver disease is a precursor to NASH.  We plan to conduct a placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of CORT118335 as a possible treatment for NASH.
Development of our Other Selective Cortisol Modulators
Our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators, which includes relacorilant, CORT125281 and CORT118335, consists of more than 500 compounds in three structurally distinct series, all covered by our ten issued U.S. composition of matter patents. All of these compounds potently bind to GR but not the progesterone, estrogen or androgen receptors. Many of these compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal or in vitro models of cortisol modulation. We plan to continue identifying new compounds and advancing the most promising of them towards the clinic. We hold United States and foreign patents covering these compounds and their methods of use in a wide range of range of indications. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for U.S. and foreign patents covering the composition and method of use of our products and product candidates. See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
Studies by Independent Investigators
For many years we have advanced our understanding of cortisol modulation by supporting the work of independent academic investigators. These researchers have studied the utility of mifepristone or our proprietary selective cortisol modulators in a wide range of disorders, including central serous retinopathy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, alcoholism, cocaine addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, muscular dystrophy, Cushing’s syndrome, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, fatty liver 
4

disease, and solid tumors, including triple-negative breast, prostate, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers, as well as sarcoma and melanoma.
Clinical Trial Agreements 
Some of our clinical trials are conducted through the use of clinical research organizations (“CROs”). Our Phase 3 trial of relacorilant for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome is being conducted under an agreement with ICON plc (“ICON”). Novella Clinical LLC (“Novella”) is helping us conduct our Phase 2 trial of relacorilant to treat patients with metastatic ovarian cancer and our Phase 1/2 trial of CORT125281 to treat patients with CRPC.  Our agreements with ICON and Novella may be terminated by us on 60 days’ written notice or sooner if the parties mutually agree.
Research and Development Spending
We incurred $75.2 million, $40.4 million and $23.8 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which accounted for 47%, 38% and 34%, respectively, of our total operating expenses in those years. 
Manufacturing Korlym
We do not have manufacturing capabilities and intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce Korlym and our product candidates. In March 2014, we entered into a long-term agreement with one contract manufacturer - Produits Chimiques Auxiliaires et de Synthese SA (“PCAS”) - to produce mifepristone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for Korlym. On July 25, 2018, we amended this agreement to add a second manufacturing site and extend its term to December 31, 2021, with two one-year automatic renewals, unless either party provides 12 months advance written notice of its intent not to renew. The amendment provides exclusivity between PCAS and Corcept. If PCAS is unable to meet our requirements, we may purchase mifepristone from another supplier. 
We have one tablet manufacturer for Korlym – Alcami Corporation (“Alcami,” formerly known as AAI Pharma Services Corp., or AAI). In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Alcami for the manufacture and packaging of Korlym tablets. The initial term of this agreement is three years, with consecutive automatic extensions of two years, unless either party gives written termination notice (in the case of Alcami, 18 months prior to the end of the applicable term; in our case, 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term). We have the right to terminate the agreement if (i) Alcami is unable to manufacture our product for four consecutive months or (ii) our product is withdrawn from the market. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Prior to its approval, the FDA designated Korlym an orphan drug for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.   Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of a drug candidate for tax credit and marketing incentives under the Orphan Drug Act, including seven years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States for drug in the specified orphan indication, if it receives the first regulatory approval for that indication, with limited exceptions.  A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug designation for one medication does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same Orphan indication. It also does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process for a drug. The FDA has designated relacorilant an orphan drug for the treatment of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome and pancreatic cancer.
Our orphan drug marketing exclusivity period for Korlym to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome ended on February 17, 2019, which means a competitor who receives FDA approval for a generic equivalent of Korlym may market its drug to patients with Cushing’s syndrome, provided doing so would not infringe any of our patents.  We have eight patents listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, that we believe would be infringed by a generic competitor for Korlym.  These patents have terms ranging from 2028 to 2037. Additional applications for patents we believe would qualify for the Orange Book are under examination by the USPTO.
Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”)
The FDCA establishes an approval process for generic versions of approved drugs (“Innovator Drugs”) through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug with the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, 
5

among other things, to the Innovator Drug. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data establishing safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the Innovator Drug.
In seeking approval, ANDA applicants must certify to the FDA that any Orange Book patents relating to the Innovator Drug are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic product.  This is known as a “Paragraph IV certification.”  If the owner of the Innovator Drug responds to receipt of a paragraph IV certification by suing the ANDA applicant for patent infringement, the FDA may not approve the ANDA application until the earlier of 30 months or when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the ANDA applicant's favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the “30-month stay.” Owners of Innovator Drugs regularly challenge paragraph IV certifications and trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve.
On February 5, 2018, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) had submitted an ANDA seeking FDA approval to market a generic form of Korlym.  Teva’s Paragraph IV certification stated that our listed Orange Book patents listed at that time, U.S. Patent No. 8,921,348 (the “’348 patent”) and U.S. Patent No. 9,829,495 (the “’495 patent”), will not be infringed by Teva’s proposed product, are invalid and/or are unenforceable.  In March 2018, we sued Teva, alleging infringement of our the ‘348 and ‘495 patents. The FDA has tentatively approved Teva’s ANDA.  However, in accordance with the Hatch-Waxman Act, as a result of Corcept’s lawsuit against Teva, the FDA cannot grant Teva’s ANDA final approval, until the earlier of 30 months following the initiation of our lawsuit or a District Court decision finding that the ‘348 and ‘495 patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed.
On July 6, 2018, we amended our original complaint against Teva and on February 8, 2019 we filed a second lawsuit against Teva, each time alleging the infringement of additional patents. These actions by us will not result in additional 30-month stays. On February 21, 2019 the District Court consolidated the two lawsuits. Although we will vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to Korlym, we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. See "Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings."
Inter Partes Review at the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board
In August 2018, Neptune Generics, LLC submitted a petition for Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) at the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of U.S. Patent No. 8,921,348 (‘348) which is related to Korlym. Neptune Generics, LLC does not have regulatory approval to sell any drug in the United States. It is backed by the litigation finance firm, Burford Capital Ltd., a U.K.-based company. On February 15, 2019, the PTAB granted institution to the IPR, and an oral argument hearing date has been set for November 14, 2019. We plan to vigorously defend the validity of the ‘348 patent.
Competition for Korlym
Korlym competes with established treatments, including surgery, radiation and other medications, and including “off-label” uses of drugs such as ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication. Korlym also competes with Novartis’ drug, Signifor® (pasireotide) Injection, which the FDA approved in December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work. Cushing’s disease is a subset of Cushing’s syndrome.
In the future, Korlym may experience competition from generic versions and from new compounds. For example, Strongbridge Biopharma plc is developing levoketoconazole, a chiral form of ketoconazole. Novartis is developing osilodrostat, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor.  Both compounds are in Phase 3 testing in the United States and European Union.
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions and to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, technological innovation and intellectual property licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We own ten composition of matter patents covering our selective cortisol modulators and 33 patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat a wide range of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome. We have exclusively licensed five method of use patents from the University of Chicago. We also own an extensive portfolio of patents in countries around the world. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for U.S. and foreign patents covering the composition and method of use of our products and product candidates.

Korlym. The composition of matter patent covering Korlym’s active ingredient, mifepristone, has expired. The only other FDA-approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy. We hold eight method of use patents listed in the FDA Orange Book covering various uses of Korlym in the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, with additional patent applications that may be suitable for listing in the Orange Book standing allowed or currently under examination at the USPTO. Our current Orange Book patents have expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2037. 

To protect our market for Korlym we rely on (1) our method of use patents, (2) the significant restrictions imposed by the FDA on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and (3) the different patient populations, administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat Cushing’s syndrome.
Oncology. We have exclusively licensed patents from the University of Chicago covering the use of glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, including mifepristone, in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer in combination with androgen deprivation agents and triple-negative breast cancer in combination with anti-cancer agents. See “Business - License Agreements.”
Other Method of Use Patents. In addition to our patents relating to Cushing’s syndrome, we own U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, mild cognitive impairment, the prevention and treatment of stress disorders, improving the therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy, the treatment of delirium, the treatment of catatonia, the treatment of psychosis with Interferon-Alpha therapy, inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with Down’s Syndrome, the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication, the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, the treatment of migraine headaches, the treatment of neurological damage in premature infants and the treatment of diseases using combination steroid and GR antagonist therapy. We own a method of use patent for optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum in patients suffering from any disorder, including Cushing’s syndrome, amenable to treatment with mifepristone. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2020 to 2037.
Composition of Matter Patents Covering Our Proprietary, Selective Cortisol Modulators. We have ten U.S. composition of matter patents containing claims relating to three structurally distinct series of next-generation cortisol modulators. Four of these patents have issued in Europe. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2026 to 2034.
We have also filed, where we deemed appropriate, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications, or that competitors or other third-parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued.
We believe that our patents are valid and that we do not infringe any third-party’s patents or other proprietary rights, and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third-parties other than the University of Chicago.
License Agreements
We have exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago five issued U.S. patents for (a) the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, and (b) the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. We are required to pay the University of Chicago customary milestone fees and royalties on revenue from products commercialized under the issued patents or patents that may issue pursuant to the pending applications. Our license will end upon expiration of the licensed patents in 2031 and 2033 or upon notification by us to the University of Chicago. Three patents licensed from Stanford University expired in October 2018. See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation
Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-approval regulation, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and promotion of the products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. All of our product candidates require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing; submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug’s intended use; and approval by the FDA. The process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense.
Preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an IND, which must be approved before 
7

beginning clinical trials in humans. If it is anticipated that the clinical trial will be conducted in Europe, a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) must be submitted and approved by the appropriate European regulatory agency prior to the commencement of the study. Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase 1. The product candidate is administered to a small number of healthy subjects to provide preliminary information as to its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and sometimes to provide preliminary information as to its activity and/or efficacy. 


• | Phase 2. The product candidate is administered to patients afflicted with the target disease to determine its preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and to provide more evidence of safety.


• | Phase 3. The product candidate is administered to a larger group of patients afflicted with the target disease to establish its risk/benefit ratio and to demonstrate with substantial evidence its efficacy and safety.

The FDA and the institutional review boards associated with clinical trial sites closely monitor the progress of clinical trials conducted in the United States and may reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate a trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable risks. The FDA may also require that additional trials be conducted.
After Phase 3 trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Applications (“NDA”). The FDA reviews an NDA upon submission and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the FDA accepts an NDA for filing, it may grant marketing approval (i.e., permit commercial sales), request additional information or deny the application. Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to examine the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, and six months for priority review if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant benefit compared to marketed drugs. FDA approvals may not be granted on a timely basis or at all.
If the FDA approves an NDA, physicians may prescribe the subject drug to patients in the United States. The FDA may withdraw a product’s marketing approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. The drug developer must submit periodic reports to the FDA. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA, which could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or removal of the product from the market.  In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of such studies.
Facilities involved in the manufacture of drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities where applicable and must comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”). Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including suspension of manufacturing or a product recall.
The FDA imposes complex regulations on entities, such as Corcept, that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals.  These include standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA has broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Failure to abide by its regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal penalties.
In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a drug developer may conduct other preclinical and clinical trials investigating use of the approved compound to treat additional indications. Data supporting the use of a drug for new indications must be approved by the FDA before the drug can be marketed for these indications.
Marketing Approvals Outside the United States
We are not seeking regulatory approval to market Korlym outside the United States. If we do so, we (or our potential future partners) will have to complete an approval process similar to the U.S. approval process before we can distribute our product candidates in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional preclinical and clinical trials. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the United States. The prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return.

Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which they will be covered by government health care programs and commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Although this trend has not had a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenues, these third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws 
We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physicians’ sunshine laws and regulations.  
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. We expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf.
In addition, there has been increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $166,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers must report such payments to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.

State and foreign laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry and complicate our compliance efforts.  For example, some states require companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the federal government’s compliance guidance or otherwise restrict payments to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources.  Some states require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information.  Some state and local governments require the public registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.  Some state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in ways that differ significantly from one another and are not preempted by HIPAA.
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
