ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. On August 26, 2010, we changed our name from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp. Effective January 1, 2015, we completed an exchange agreement to purchase 100% of the outstanding interests of RemSleep LLC in exchange for 50,000,000 common shares of RemSleep Holdings, Inc.’s stock, at which time RemSleep LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary and adopted their business of developing and distributing our sleep apnea products. On January 5, 2015, we changed our name to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. to reflect our new business model.
 
Our officers have 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including having been employed at sleep industry companies. Our officers invented our DeltaWave CPAP interface (the “DeltaWave”) as an innovative new device to treat patients with sleep apnea. The patent-pending DeltaWave product is a nasal-pillows type interface that will result in better comfort and, therefore, better compliance since it was specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally. A survey that appeared in DME Business found that 89% of patients stated that mask-interface comfort was their primary concern. The primary issue that we have addressed with the DeltaWave is the “work of breathing” component. We believe that our DeltaWave is designed to effectively address the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patient’s ability to comply with treatment, as follows:
 

● | Does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------
● | Is not claustrophobic; 
● | Causes zero work of breathing (WOB); 
● | Minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses; 
● | Uses less driving pressure; and 
● | Allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping.

 
Pending adequate financing, we plan to conduct clinical trials to test product effectiveness.
 
On June 28, 2016, we applied for a patent for a new, innovative sleep apnea product that serves as an interface for the delivery of CPAP therapy and other respiratory needs. Our goal is to develop sleep products that achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients.

Industry Background
 
The market for sleep treatment and equipment was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, with North America accounting for a majority of the market. More than 8 million CPAP interfaces are sold annually in the U.S., with another 2.5 million globally. There are also an estimated 80 million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition that affects millions of people in the United States alone. An increasingly sedentary lifestyle and bad working habits has led to obesity and otherwise poor cardiac and aerobic health. This has led to a fast-growing epidemic of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which greatly reduces the quality of sleep one gets and can ultimately result in hypertension, heart failure, stroke, and at the least, reduced performance in everyday life. The market for sleep treatment and equipment was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, with North America accounting for a majority of the market. More than 8 million CPAP interfaces are sold annually in the U.S., with another 2.5 million globally. There are also an estimated 80 million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Sleep apnea results in numerous afflictions that affect people’s day-to-day lives and can eventually contribute to serious health conditions. While people’s knowledge of this affliction has grown strongly in recent years, and the market is expanding fast nationwide, up to 80% of people with sleep apnea may be undiagnosed 1 – a market of millions of new potential users. Even those who are tested and prescribed a sleep apnea machine often give up after a short time due to discomfort or what is called the “work of breathing” with traditional machines. In fact, over 50% of patients give up on using CPAP therapy after 6 months. This is a major waste of resources and a very telling statistic.
 
A major challenge in the current market is not only to get more patients diagnosed but to also increase CPAP compliance. According to market analyst Frost & Sullivan, “The development of finer and ergonomic CPAP devices will help increase patient ability to adhere to sleep therapy. The market is also seeing a rise in newer technologies that replace elaborate practices, target patient comfort to improve compliance, and help drive acceptance of sleep monitoring devices.”
 
A growing knowledge of sleep apnea and its treatment has helped to increase awareness with the public. In addition to making the use of a CPAP or related device less intimidating, a move toward affordable and prescription-based technology can greatly expand the market “Evolving technologies will also influence patient preferences for products, treatment modalities, and diagnostic locations,” states Frost & Sullivan 2. “As such, the global sleep apnea treatment market is expected to shift to home-based diagnostics for early identification and treatment of patients as well as portable devices that can reduce sleep apnea with minimal inconvenience.”
 
Sleep apnea causes breathing interruptions of between 10 to 20 seconds that can occur hundreds of times during a night, disrupting the natural sleep rhythm and depriving people of the restorative sleep they need to be energetic, mentally sharp, and productive the next day. CPAP can be a very effective method used to treat sleep apnea, but as noted, noncompliance remains a stubborn issue for both physicians and patients. CPAP technology therefore is constantly being updated and improved, and the new CPAP devices are lighter, quieter, and more comfortable.
 
Health care spending continues to grow rapidly on an annual basis in the United States. Spending was $2.7 trillion in 2011 and, in 2013, it reached over $3.6 trillion. By 2022, spending is projected to reach $5 trillion, or around 20% of GDP, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 3. Growing alongside this market is the U.S. life science industry, which will grow an estimated 2.2% in 2014 to $93 billion. This includes R&D spending, with growth primarily from smaller biopharmaceutical innovators and medical device manufacturers.
 
Within this market, sleep apnea products have experienced rapid growth. In the past couple of decades there has been a rapid increase in the technological developments in the field of sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment. The result has been strong growth for sleep apnea devices globally. Demand for new and innovative treatment methodologies is driving growth, helping to provide patients with a healthy lifestyle. “Obstructive sleep apnea is destroying the health of millions of Americans, and the problem has only gotten worse over the last two decades,” according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine President Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler 5. “The effective treatment of sleep apnea is one of the keys to success as our nation attempts to reduce health care spending and improve chronic disease management.”
 
Sleep problems are considered a “global epidemic,” with sleep apnea as a major contributor to the disorder. An estimated 100 million people worldwide have sleep apnea, though more than 80% of these people are undiagnosed. The market for sleep apnea diagnostic and therapeutic devices on a global level was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, according to a study from Markets & Markets.6 Nationwide in the U.S., there are more than 1,600 businesses in the Sleep Disorder Clinics market, according to research firm IBISWorld. These businesses have combined annual revenue of $7 billion and have maintained a combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% from 2008 to 2013. “Sleep clinics have gained exposure during the period due to the rising number of sleep disorders,” states IBISWorld. “Moreover, health insurance policies are increasingly covering all or at least part of the costs of tests and, as more patients have been able to gain greater access to specialized sleep clinics, industry revenue grows.”

There are also more than 972,000 physicians and 365,000 doctors’ offices, as well as nearly 5,800 hospitals. In addition, the market for U.S. home healthcare is served by about 30,000 businesses with combined annual revenue of $59 billion. The market includes medical and skilled nursing services; medical equipment, supplies, and medication services; personal care; and therapeutic services (like physical and respiratory therapy).

Government Regulations
 
FDA
 
Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.
 
Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness.
 
Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed in reliance on 510(k) pre-marketing clearances as either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information.

Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The FDA is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. The FDA is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination. It is unclear whether the FDA’s approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510(k) is required for changes or modifications to existing devices.
 
Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the FDA’s regulatory requirements.
 
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
 
Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or un-cleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Other Healthcare Laws
 
Even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other third-party payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the United States, we are still subject to laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act.

The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation.
 
Also, many states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
 
Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. In addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
 
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act was enacted in law as part of PPACA, which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Environmental Regulation 
 
Our operations are not subject to environmental regulation.
