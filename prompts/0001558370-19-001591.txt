 Item 1. Business
 Our Formation
 We were incorporated in Delaware on May 21, 2014 and were formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities. On July 24, 2017, one of our subsidiaries merged with and into NextDecade LLC, a LNG development company founded in 2010 to develop LNG export projects and associated pipelines.  Prior to the merger with NextDecade LLC, we had no operations and our assets consisted of cash proceeds received in connection with our initial public offering.
 Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “NEXT.”
 Our warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering in 2015 (the “IPO Warrants”) trade on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol “NEXTW.”
 Company Overview
 Our management is comprised of a team of industry leaders with extensive experience in LNG marketing and project development.  We have focused and continue to focus our development activities on the Project and have undertaken and continue to undertake various initiatives to evaluate, design and engineer the Project that we expect will result in demand for LNG supply at the Terminal, which would allow us to seek construction financing to develop the Project.    We believe the Project possesses competitive advantages in several important areas, including engineering, design, commercial, regulatory and gas supply. We submitted a pre-filing request for the Project to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) in March 2015 and filed a formal application with the FERC in May 2016. We also believe we have robust commercial offtake and gas supply strategies and we estimate that the Project will commence commercial operations as early as 2023.
 We believe that the Terminal, to be located on a 984-acre site in Brownsville, Texas, along with the Pipeline connecting the Terminal to the Agua Dulce market area, is well-positioned among the second wave of United States (“U.S.”) LNG projects. The Terminal is engineered to have liquefaction capacity of 27 million metric tons of LNG per annum (“mtpa”). It is located to take advantage of natural gas resources in Texas, including the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We plan to construct, develop, own and operate the Project. We have an exclusive option for a long-term lease with the Port of Brownsville for the Terminal site through November 5, 2019.
 The Project is expected to be permitted for up to six liquefaction trains (each with a nominal capacity of at least 4.5 mtpa), four LNG storage tanks (each with a capacity of 180,000 cubic meters), two marine jetties for ocean-going LNG vessels, one turning basin, and six truck loading bays for LNG and natural gas liquids. The Pipeline is expected to be comprised of twin, 137-mile-long, 42-inch-outside diameter, natural gas pipelines, three 180,000-horsepower compressor stations, two 30,000-horsepower interconnect booster stations, six mainline valve sites, four metering sites, and various ancillary facilities. The twin pipelines are expected to be rated to a maximum allowable operating pressure of 1,480 pounds per square inch and total deliverability of at least 4.5 billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”). We are exploring design enhancements to increase throughput capacity for the Project.
 We have also leased a 994-acre site on the Houston Ship Channel in Texas City, Texas for our second U.S. LNG project, which is expected to be permitted for up to three trains (each with a nominal capacity of 5.5 mtpa), a minimum of two LNG storage tanks (each with a capacity of 200,000 cubic meters), two marine jetties for ocean-going LNG vessels and one turning basin (the “Galveston Bay Terminal”).  We intend to use similar design and engineering as the Terminal.  
 Engineering, Procurement, and Construction
 During the third quarter of 2018, we initiated a competitive engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) bid process.  We received expressions of interest (the “EOIs”) from multiple EPC contractors to participate in the EPC process.  We reviewed the EOIs against a series of selection criteria and issued formal invitations to bid to Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc., Fluor Enterprises, Inc. and McDermott International, Inc.  In December 2018, each of the EPC

bidders provided us with an endorsement of the Terminal’s front-end engineering and design (“FEED”), which indicates the bidders’ confirmation that the Terminal is technically feasible and can be further designed, engineered, permitted, constructed, commissioned and safely placed into operations.  The EPC bid process is scheduled to culminate on April 22, 2019 with the submission by each EPC contractor of a lump-sum turnkey EPC price.  We expect to execute a final EPC contract in the third quarter of 2019.
 Commercial
 We are continuing commercial discussions with a variety of parties ranging from large utilities and state-sponsored enterprises to portfolio and multinational commodity interests.  Leveraging the global relationships and extensive experience of our management team, we expect to sign long-term binding offtake commitments for substantially all of the Terminal’s capacity prior to a final investment decision (“FID”).
 We believe the Project’s location will provide customers with access to low-cost natural gas from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We are focused on selling LNG to customers through a “free on board” model whereby a marketing affiliate would acquire feed gas, the Terminal would produce the LNG and the title transfer would occur at the interface between the Terminal and the customer’s ship. 
 In 2018, we complemented our Henry Hub-based offering with LNG pricing indexed to the Agua Dulce area, Waha and Brent crude oil prices.  As discussed below, we believe this Brent indexed product is a competitive advantage related to our access to associated gas from the Permian basin as it allows us to access new customer segments that desire an alternative to Henry Hub priced LNG. This builds on natural advantages of U.S. LNG export projects such as the country’s abundant gas supply, existing pipeline infrastructure, political stability, and a competitive project execution environment. 
 Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations
 We will be required to obtain governmental approvals and authorizations to implement our proposed business strategy, which includes the design, construction and operation of the Project and the export of LNG from the U.S. to foreign countries. The design, construction and operation of LNG export terminals is a regulated activity and is subject to Section 3 of the federal Natural Gas Act (the “NGA”). Federal law has bifurcated regulatory jurisdiction of LNG export and import activities.  The FERC has jurisdiction over the siting, construction and permitting of LNG import and export facilities.  The U.S. Department of Energy (the “DOE”) has jurisdiction over the import and export of the natural gas commodity, including natural gas in the form of LNG.  The FERC also has jurisdiction over the siting, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines under Section 7 of the NGA and regulates interstate pipelines’ terms and conditions of service under Sections 4 and 5 of the NGA. In 2002, the FERC established a policy of not regulating the terms and conditions of service for LNG import or export facilities or requiring that LNG import or export facilities operate as “open access” facilities for all customers.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which amended the NGA, codified this policy until January 1, 2015, and the FERC has not indicated that it intends to depart from its policy of not regulating the terms or conditions of service or requiring that LNG terminals operate on an open access basis.
 Although the FERC is the primary agency with jurisdiction over LNG import and export facilities, the FERC works closely with other federal and state agencies to evaluate applications for LNG export facilities.  These agencies include the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”), the U.S. Coast Guard (the “Coast Guard”), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the International Boundary and Water Commission and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over potential environmental impacts of LNG terminal construction and operation.  Certain federal laws, such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act, delegate authority over certain actions to state agencies.  In reviewing an application for an LNG import or export terminal or an interstate natural gas pipeline, the FERC also works with these state agencies that have jurisdiction over certain aspects of LNG terminal or interstate natural gas pipeline construction or operation.
 In particular, the PHMSA has established safety standards for interstate natural gas pipelines and LNG facilities.  Similarly, the Coast Guard has established safety regulations for marine operations at LNG facilities and the operation of LNG carriers.  The FERC, the PHMSA and the Coast Guard entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in 2004 that

establishes the FERC’s primary role in evaluating LNG terminal applications and defines the process for coordinating the review of an LNG import or export terminal application with the PHMSA and the Coast Guard.  In 2018, the FERC and the PHMSA entered into a separate Memorandum of Understanding that establishes the process and timeline by which the PHMSA should determine whether an LNG terminal project will meet the PHMSA’s LNG safety siting standards.
 We filed our formal application for the Project with the FERC on May 5, 2016 and received a Draft Environmental Impact Statement from the FERC on October 12, 2018.  The FERC’s approval of the Terminal under Section 3 of the NGA and of the Pipeline under Section 7 of the NGA is expected in late July 2019.  Separately, we submitted a pre-filing request to the FERC for the Galveston Bay Terminal on August 31, 2018, and the FERC initiated its pre-filing process for that application on October 10, 2018.
 Section 3 of the NGA requires prior authorization by the DOE for the import or export of natural gas, including LNG, from the U.S. The DOE’s practice has been to include certain reporting requirements in its LNG export authorizations, including mandating the reporting of the foreign destination of U.S.-sourced LNG.  In December 2018, the DOE clarified its reporting requirements, directing LNG export authorization holders and their downstream counterparties to report the destination to which the U.S.-sourced LNG was “actually delivered,” in contrast to the agency’s prior policy requiring the reporting of where the LNG was “delivered for end use.”  This revised policy recognizes the increasing flexibility and liquidity in the global LNG market.
 On September 7, 2016, Rio Grande obtained an authorization for export of LNG to countries with which the U.S. has a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) on our own behalf and as an agent for others for a term of 30 years.  On June 13, 2018, Galveston Bay obtained a similar authorization for export of LNG to FTA countries on our own behalf and as an agent for others for a term of 20 years.  The DOE’s December 2018 order adjusting the reporting requirements applies to both of the authorizations for LNG to FTA countries.  However, many of our target markets are not FTA countries. We have applied to the DOE for approval to export LNG to non-FTA countries.  Non-FTA authorizations are expected shortly after completion of the FERC’s environmental review processes.
 Gas Supply
 The proposed Terminal site will be located in Brownsville, Texas, benefiting from close access to the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We expect to realize material benefits from providing our customers with access to these low-cost associated gas resources.  Independent shale producers have created extraordinary efficiencies and improvements, including enhanced well recoveries through extended lateral lengths and hydraulic fracturing technology, rig productivity, and operating and lifecycle costs. However, U.S. demand has not risen proportionally with the growth in recoverable reserves.
 For example, whereas U.S. demand for natural gas has generally increased modestly year-over-year the past few decades, the level of new discoveries and production has been significant.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”), domestic demand for natural gas has increased from approximately 20 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) per year in 1980 to approximately 27.1 Tcf in 2017, a 35 percent increase.  However, proved reserves of natural gas have increased by approximately 200 Tcf over the same period, a 100 percent increase. Due to technological advancements, almost all U.S. reserve basins are able to produce gas for a break-even cost of less than $3.00/MMBtu, which is less than the approximate price implied by gas forward curves for at least the next ten years.
 The Permian Basin has exceeded expectations and produced large quantities of associated gas, the production of which occurs as a byproduct with oil production. The State of Texas severely restricts the flaring of natural gas, so infrastructure is required to transport this associated gas to Gulf Coast markets economically. Two new high-pressure Permian pipeline gas takeaway projects are being constructed.  The first is the Gulf Coast Express (“GCX”) project.  With an estimated in-service date of October 2019, the GCX project will move an estimated 1.9 Bcf/d of gas from the Waha area in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas, where the Terminal expects to receive gas supply.   The second project is the Permian Highway Pipeline, capable of bringing 2.0 Bcf/day of gas supply to the Katy Hub, located just outside of Houston, Texas with a portion of that capacity able to be delivered to markets from Freeport, Texas to the Agua Dulce area of Texas.  These new pipelines will provide a much-needed exit strategy for incremental Permian gas supplies.

 The Permian Basin is approaching its 100th year of oil production.  At present, production has reached a record 3.8 million barrels per day (MBPD) and is estimated to grow to 6.4 MBPD by 2022, making it the world’s second-most-prolific field, behind Ghawar in Saudi Arabia.  
 In December 2018, the EIA estimated natural gas production in the Permian Basin to be 12.4 Bcf/d, up from 6.9 Bcf/d in May 2016.   This significant increase in gas production relative to anticipated takeaway capacity constraints (despite expected capacity growth), has led to a negative basis at the Waha Hub relative to the Henry Hub.
 We believe that the Pipeline, projected to have at least eight interconnects with a combined 6.7 Bcf/d of receipt capacity, will have supply flexibility and be price competitive. Eastward takeaway capacity from the Permian is already expanding in the region, with high-profile plans over the next 9 to 18 months among key pipeline sponsors.  The combination of increased production and expanding takeaway capacity indicates that the Agua Dulce hub, from which the Pipeline is proposed to be routed, is expected to become increasingly liquid and remain competitively priced to Henry Hub. We believe our proximity to two major gas reserves basins, increasing takeaway capacity in the area, a significant influx of production and infrastructure investment over the last 12 to 18 months, as well as our existing contacts and discussions with some of the largest regional operators, represent key elements of a compelling feed gas strategy for partners and customers alike. We are continuing to advance substantive negotiations in these areas.
 Competition 
 We are subject to a high degree of competition in all aspects of our business. See “Item 1.A — Risk Factors —Competition in the energy industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.”
 The Project will compete with liquefaction facilities worldwide to supply low-cost liquefaction to the market. There are liquefaction facilities worldwide that we will compete with for customers.  In addition, we will compete with a variety of companies in the global LNG market, such as independent, technology-driven companies, major and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, greater access to the LNG market, more employees and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 36 full-time employees and 11 independent contractors.  We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis and have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.   Offices
 Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Louisiana St., Suite 3900, Houston, Texas, 77002, and our telephone number is (713) 574-1880.
