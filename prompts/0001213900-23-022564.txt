Item 1. Business



IT Tech Packaging, Inc. (the “Company,” “IT Tech Packaging,” or “ITP”) is not an operating company but a Nevada holding company with operations primarily conducted by its subsidiary and variable interest entity, or VIE, in China. IT Tech Packaging operated its business in China through its wholly-owned PRC subsidiaries, namely Baoding Shengde Paper Co., Ltd., a People’s Republic of China company (“Baoding Shengde”) and QianrongQianhui Hebei Technology Co., Ltd., a People’s Republic of China company (“Qianrong”) (together with Baoding Shengde, the “PRC Subsidiaries”), and Hebei Baoding Dongfang Paper Milling Company Limited (“Dongfang Paper”), which we refer to as our VIE in this annual report, and rely on contractual arrangements that establish the VIE structure among Baoding Shengde, the VIE and VIE’s shareholders to operate our business in China.



IT Tech Packaging is a Nevada holding company with no operations of its own. Operations in China are primarily conducted through Dongfeng Paper, the consolidated VIE. Dongfang Paper is consolidated for accounting purposes but is not an entity in which you own equity.



Investors in our common stock should be aware that they may never directly hold equity interests in the Chinese operating entities, but rather purchasing equity solely in IT Tech Packaging Inc., our Nevada holding company, which does not directly own substantially all of our business in China conducted by our PRC Subsidiaries and VIE.



Because of our corporate structure, we as well as the investors are subject to unique risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application of the PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to regulatory review of oversea listing of PRC companies through a special purpose vehicle. We are also subject to the risks of uncertainty about any future actions of the PRC government in this regard. We may also be subject to sanctions imposed by PRC regulatory agencies including Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) if we fail to comply with their rules and regulations. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC central or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry, if we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required when they are, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we are required to obtain approval in the future. For a description of relevant risks related to our corporate structure, see “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Doing Business in China” and “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure.”



Corporate History



IT Tech Packaging was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 9, 2005, under the name “Carlateral, Inc.” Through the steps described below, we became the holding company with operations primarily conducted by our subsidiaries and our VIE, Dongfang Paper, a producer and distributor of paper products in China, on October 29, 2007. Effective on August 1, 2018, we changed our corporate name to IT Tech Packaging, Inc. The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of IT Tech Packaging, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into us. We were the surviving entity. In connection with the name change, our common stock began being traded under a new NYSE symbol, “ITP,” at such time.



On October 29, 2007, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), the Company acquired Dongfang Zhiye Holding Limited (“Dongfang Holding”), a corporation formed on November 13, 2006 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and issued the shareholders of Dongfang Holding an aggregate of 7,450,497 (as adjusted for a four-for-one reverse stock split effected in November 2009) shares of our common stock, which shares were distributed pro-rata to the shareholders of Dongfang Holding in accordance with their respective ownership interests in Dongfang Holding. At the time of the Merger Agreement, Dongfang Holding owned all of the issued and outstanding stock and ownership of Dongfang Paper and such shares of Dongfang Paper were held in trust with Zhenyong Liu, Xiaodong Liu and Shuangxi Zhao, for Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhao (the original shareholders of Dongfang Paper) to exercise control over the disposition of Dongfang Holding’s shares in Dongfang Paper on Dongfang Holding’s behalf until Dongfang Holding successfully completed the change in registration of Dongfang Paper’s capital with the relevant PRC Administration of Industry and Commerce as the 100% owner of Dongfang Paper’s shares. As a result of the merger transaction, Dongfang Holding became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Dongfang Holding’s wholly owned subsidiary, Dongfang Paper, became an indirectly owned subsidiary of the Company.



Dongfang Holding, as the 100% owner of Dongfang Paper, was unable to complete the registration of Dongfang Paper’s capital under its name within the proper time limits set forth under PRC law. In connection with the consummation of the restructuring transactions described below, Dongfang Holding directed the trustees to return the shares of Dongfang Paper to their original shareholders, and the original Dongfang Paper shareholders entered into certain agreements with Baoding Shengde Paper Co., Ltd. (“Baoding Shengde”) to transfer the control of Dongfang Paper over to Baoding Shengde.



On June 24, 2009, the Company consummated a number of restructuring transactions pursuant to which it acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Shengde Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation. Shengde Holdings Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 25, 2009, and holds a wholly-owned subsidiary, Baoding Shengde, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the PRC on June 1, 2009. Because Baoding Shengde is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shengde Holdings Inc., it is regarded as a wholly foreign-owned entity under PRC law.






1







Effective June 24, 2009, Baoding Shengde, Dongfang Paper and the original shareholders of Dongfang Paper entered into a number of contractual arrangements, as subsequently amended on February 10, 2010, pursuant to which Baoding Shengde acts as the management company for Dongfang Paper, and Dongfang Paper conducts the principal operations of the business. The contractual arrangements, as amended, effectively transferred the preponderance of the economic benefits of Dongfang Paper to Baoding Shengde, and as a result, Baoding Shengde assumed effective control and management over, is considered the primary beneficiary of Dongfang Paper for accounting purposes and we consolidate Dongfang Paper’s operating results in IT Tech Packaging’s financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The contractual arrangements, as amended, include the following:




(i) | Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The exclusive technical service and business consulting agreement, entered into by and between Baoding Shengde and Dongfang Paper, provides that Baoding Shengde shall provide exclusive technical, business and management consulting services to Dongfang Paper, in exchange for service fees including a fee equivalent to 80% of Dongfang Paper’s total annual net profits. The agreement is terminable upon mutual written agreement.




(ii) | Call Option Agreement
-----+----------------------




The call option agreement, entered into by and between Baoding Shengde, Dongfang Paper and the shareholders of Dongfang Paper, provides that the shareholders of Dongfang Paper irrevocably grant to Baoding Shengde an option to purchase all or part of each shareholder’s equity interest in Dongfang Paper. The exercise price for the options shall be RMB yuan for each of the shareholders’ equity interests, or if at any time there are PRC laws regulating the minimum exercise price of such options, then to the extent permitted under PRC Law. The call option agreement contains covenants from Dongfang Paper and its shareholders that they will refrain from taking certain actions without Baoding Shengde’s consent that would materially affect Dongfang Paper’s operations and asset value, including (i) supplementing or amending its articles of association or bylaws, (ii) changing Dongfang Paper’s registered capital or shareholding structure, (iii) selling, transferring, mortgaging or disposing of any interests in Dongfang Paper’s assets or income, or encumbering Dongfang Paper’s assets or income in a way that would approve a security interest on such assets, (iv) incurring or guaranteeing any debts not incurred in its normal business operations, (v) entering into any material contract or urging Dongfang Paper management to dispose of any Dongfang Paper assets, unless it is within the company’s normal business operations; (vi) providing any loan or guarantee to any third party; (vii) appointing or removing any management personnel or directors that can be changed upon Dongfang Paper shareholder approval; (viii) declaring or distributing any dividends to the stockholders. The agreement remains effective until Baoding Shengde or its designees have acquired 100% of the equity interests of Dongfang Paper underlying the options.




(iii) | Share Pledge Agreement 
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------




The share pledge agreement entered into by and between Baoding Shengde, Dongfang Paper and the shareholders of Dongfang Paper, provides that the Dongfang Paper shareholders will pledge all of their equity interests in Dongfang Paper to Baoding Shengde as security for their obligations under the other management agreements described in this section. Specifically, Baoding Shengde is entitled to dispose of the pledged equity interests in the event that the Dongfang Paper shareholders or Dongfang Paper fails to pay the service fees to Baoding Shengde pursuant to the exclusive technical service and business consulting agreement or fails to perform their other obligations under the other management agreement. The agreement contains covenants from Dongfang Paper’s shareholders that they will refrain from taking certain actions without Baoding Shengde’s prior written consent, such as transferring or assigning their equity interests, or creating or permitting the creation of any pledges which may have an adverse effect on the rights or benefits of Baoding Shengde under the agreement. The Dongfang Paper shareholders also promise to comply with the laws and regulations relevant to the pledges under the agreement and to facilitate in good faith the protection of the ability of Baoding Shengde to exercise its rights under the agreement. The terms of the share pledge agreement remains in effect until all the obligations under the other management agreements have been fulfilled, whether or not the terms of the other management agreements have expired.




(iv) | Proxy Agreement 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------




The proxy agreement, entered into by and between Baoding Shengde, Dongfang Paper and the shareholders of Dongfang Paper, provides that the Dongfang Paper shareholders shall irrevocably entrust a designee of Baoding Shengde with such shareholder’s voting rights and the right to represent such shareholder to exercise his or her rights at any shareholder’s meeting of Dongfang Paper or with respect to any shareholder action to be taken in accordance with the laws and Dongfang Paper’s Articles of Association. The terms of the agreement are binding on the parties for as long as the Dongfang Paper shareholders continue to hold any equity interest in Dongfang Paper. Dongfang Paper shareholder will cease to be a party to the agreement once it transfers its equity interests with the prior approval of Baoding Shengde.



On June 24, 2009, Zhao Tianqing, the sole shareholder of Shengde Holdings Inc., assigned to the Company, for good and valuable consideration, 100 shares representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Shengde Holdings Inc. As a result of this assignment and the restructuring transactions described above, Shengde Holdings Inc., Baoding Shengde, and Dongfang Paper became directly and indirectly controlled by the Company, and Dongfang Paper continued to function as the Company’s operating entity.

In addition to controlling the operations and beneficial ownership of Dongfang Paper, Baoding Shengde also acquired a digital photo paper production line (including two photo paper coating lines and ancillary equipment) in an asset acquisition transaction on November 25, 2009 and began directly conducting business in the PRC. We suspended production of photo paper in June 2016 and now are upgrading the production line to produce more competitive photo paper products.



An agreement was entered into among Baoding Shengde, Dongfang Paper and the shareholders of Dongfang Paper on December 31, 2010, reiterating that Baoding Shengde is entitled to the distributable profit of Dongfang Paper, pursuant to the above mentioned Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement. In addition, Dongfang Paper and the shareholders of Dongfang Paper agreed that they would not declare any of Dongfang Paper’s unappropriated earnings, including any earnings of Dongfang Paper from its establishment to 2010 and thereafter, as dividend.



The contractual agreements described above have not been tested in a court of law.

Recent Regulatory Developments



On January 4, 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, issued the revised Measures on Cyberspace Security Review (the “Revised Measures”), which came into effect on February 15, 2022. Under the Revised Measures, any “network platform operator” controlling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cyber security review.



We do not believe we are “network platform operator” who control over one million personal information as mentioned above; as such, we believe we are currently not be subject to the cyber security review by the CAC. However, the definition of “network platform operator” is unclear and it is also unclear on how it will be interpreted and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. See “Risk factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China — Our business may be subject to a variety of PRC laws and other obligations regarding cyber security and data protection.”



On July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC governmental authorities made public the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. As these opinions are recently issued, official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued yet and the interpretation of these opinions remains unclear at this stage. See “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China — While the approval and/or other requirements of the CSRC or other PRC governmental authorities are currently not required, they may be required, in connection with our oversea listing under PRC rules, regulations or policies, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or how soon we will be able to obtain such approval.” As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions regarding listing abroad or offshore offering from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities.



We believe that we are currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) and Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) in the PRC to issue securities to foreign investors. However, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in the future in relation to any future offerings of our company or the continued listing of our company’s securities on the NYSE American, or even in the event such permission or approval is required and obtained, it will not be subsequently revoked or rescinded. If we do not receive or maintain the approvals, or we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval in the future, we may be subject to an investigation by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless.



On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released the Trial Administrative Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Measures”) and five supporting guidelines, which will come into effect on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedures and report relevant information to the CSRC. If a domestic company fails to complete the filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject to administrative penalties by the CSRC, such as order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines. As a listed company, we believe that we, all of our PRC Subsidiaries, the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary are not required to fulfill filing procedures and obtain approvals from the CSRC to continue to offer our securities or operate business of the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary as of the date of this annual report. In addition, to date, none of us, our PRC Subsidiaries, the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary has received any filing or compliance requirements from CSRC for the listing of the Company at NYSE American and all of its overseas offerings. Furthermore, based on our understanding of the current PRC laws, we believe that the CSRC’s approval is not required to be obtained for the Company’s listing on NYSE American; however, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors (“M&A Rules”), other PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that any governmental agency will not take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from our belief stated herein. See “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China — The CSRC has released the Trial Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Measures”). While such rules have not yet gone into effect, the Chinese government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer our securities to investors and could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless”

On December 24, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress issued Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution (the “Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution Law”), which became effective on June 5, 2022. According to the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution Law, entities subject to the pollutant discharge licensing management requirements shall not emit industrial noise without a pollutant discharge permit and shall prevent and control noise pollution according to the requirements of the pollutant discharge permit. The noise pollution has been included in the Pollution Discharge Permit, and we conduct quarterly test on the noise through qualified testing institutions to comply with the laws, which is required by laws.



Consolidation



We conduct substantially all of our business in China through Dongfang Paper, the VIE, due to PRC legal restrictions of foreign ownership in certain sectors. Substantially most of IT Tech Packaging’s revenues, costs and net income in China are directly or indirectly generated through the VIE. IT Tech Packaging, through Baoding Shengde, has signed various agreements with the VIE and shareholders of the VIE to allow the transfer of economic benefits from the VIE to Baoding Shengde and to direct the activities of the VIE.



Total assets and liabilities presented on IT Tech Packaging’s consolidated balance sheets and revenue, expense, net income presented on consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income as well as the cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities presented on the consolidated statement of cash flows are substantially the financial position, operation and cash flow of the VIE. As of December 31, 2022, our variable interest entity accounted for an aggregate of 88.54% and 72.59% of our total assets and total liabilities. As of December 31, 2021, our variable interest entity accounted for an aggregate of 84.13% and 69.51% of our total assets and total liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $7,612,294 and $2,058,841 of cash and cash equivalents were denominated in RMB, respectively.



IT Tech Packaging and its directly owned subsidiary, Shengde Holding, do not have any substantial assets or liabilities or result of operations. The following table sets forth the assets, liabilities, results of operations and changes in cash, cash equivalents of the VIE, which were included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows with intercompany transactions eliminated:

Distributions and Other Transfers of Cash through our Organization



We are a holding company, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, we may receive dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiary established in China for our cash needs, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders to the extent we choose to do so, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. Our PRC Subsidiaries, consolidated VIE and its subsidiary in China are subject to restrictions on making dividends and other payments to us. Baoding Shengde’s income in turn depends on the service and other fees paid by the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary. ITP, its subsidiaries, the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary may also transfer cash to each other as part of the group cash management. If any of our subsidiaries, the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC Subsidiaries in China to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, under the applicable requirements of PRC law, our PRC Subsidiaries, consolidated VIE and its subsidiary incorporated as companies may only distribute dividends after they have made allowances to fund certain statutory reserves. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.



IT Tech Packaging conducts its business operations in China through its PRC Subsidiaries and Dongfang Paper, the VIE. If needed, IT Tech Packaging can transfer cash to the PRC Subsidiaries through loans and/or capital contributions, and the PRC Subsidiaries can transfer cash to IT Tech Packaging through issuing dividends or other distributions. The PRC Subsidiaries can transfer cash to the VIE through intercompany loans and capital contributions, and the VIE can transfer cash to the PRC Subsidiaries as services fees under the VIE contractual arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the cash flows occurred between IT Tech Packaging, its subsidiaries and the VIE included (i) funding through Shengde Holdings Inc. to Baoding Shengde, with an amount of $6,500,000 as capital contributions; (ii) Baoding Shengde loans to Dongfang Paper with total amount of $1,727,644; (iii) Baoding Shengde loans to Tengsheng Paper with total amount of $1,923,845; and (iv) funding through Shengde Holdings Inc. to Qianrong, with an amount of $3,500,000 as capital contributions. We do not have an established cash management policy that dictates how funds are transferred between us, our subsidiaries, consolidated VIE and its subsidiary. We do not, at this time, intend to distribute earnings or settle amounts owed under the VIE Agreements.



Current PRC regulations permit the PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends to its shareholders only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The PRC Subsidiaries are required to set aside 10% of its after-tax profits to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital if it distributes its after-tax profits for the current financial year. For details, see “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China — We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.” In addition, cash transfers from IT Tech Packaging are subject to applicable PRC laws and regulations on loans and direct investment. For details, see “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China — PRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC Subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.”

In addition, the PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. IT Tech Packaging receives a significant portion of its revenues in Renminbi. Under IT Tech Packaging’s current corporate structure, IT Tech Packaging’s Nevada holding company may rely on dividend payments from the PRC Subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements it may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of the PRC Subsidiaries and VIE to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to its shareholders. See “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China — Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment”. In order to secure the amounts owed under the VIE agreements, the VIE and its shareholders entered into a share pledge agreement with Baoding Shengde, pursuant to which if the VIE fails to pay the service fees to the Baoding Shengde pursuant to the exclusive technical service and business consulting agreement or fails to perform their other obligations under the other management agreement, Baoding Shengde is entitled to dispose of the pledged equity interests in the VIE.



IT Tech Packaging declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends to its U.S. investors in April 2012 and November 2013. As of the date of this annual report, other than those cash dividends, none of IT Tech Packaging’s subsidiaries have ever issued any dividends or made other distributions to IT Tech Packaging or their respective holding companies nor has IT Tech Packaging or any of IT Tech Packaging’s subsidiaries ever paid dividends or made other distributions to U.S. investors. IT Tech Packaging currently intend to retain all future earnings to finance its operations and to expand its business. As a result, IT Tech Packaging does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.



Holding Foreign Company Accountable Act (“HFCAA”)



Our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“HFCAA”), if the PCAOB is unable to adequately inspect audit documentation located in China, or investigate our auditor. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which was signed into law on December 29, 2022, amends the HFCAA and requires the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. Our auditor, WWC, P.C., Certified Public Accountants, is a U.S.-based accounting firm registered with the PCAOB, and is subject to laws in the United States pursuant to which the PCAOB conducts regular inspections to assess its compliance with the applicable professional standards. Our auditor is headquartered in the United States and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis with the last inspection in November 2021. On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed the Protocol with the CSRC and the MOF of the People’s Republic of China, governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong. The Protocol remains unpublished and is subject to further explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the SEC, the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong completely in 2022. The PCAOB Board vacated its previous 2021 determinations that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong. However, whether the PCAOB will continue to be able to satisfactorily conduct inspections of PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in China mainland and Hong Kong is subject to uncertainty and depends on a number of factors out of our, and our auditor’s control. The PCAOB is continuing to demand complete access in China mainland and Hong Kong moving forward and is already making plans to resume regular inspections in early 2023 and beyond, as well as to continue pursuing ongoing investigations and initiate new investigations as needed. The PCAOB has indicated that it will act immediately to consider the need to issue new determinations with the HFCAA if needed. Therefore, the PCAOB in the future may determine that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong. Our auditor’s working papers related to us and the consolidated VIE and its subsidiary are located in China. If our auditor is not permitted to provide requested audit work papers located in China to the PCAOB, investors would be deprived of the benefits of PCAOB’s oversight of our auditor through such inspections which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets and trading of our securities may be prohibited under the HFCAA, which would result in the delisting of our securities from the NYSE American.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Associated with Our Company— Our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB is unable to adequately inspect audit documentation located in China. The delisting of our common stock, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.”

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Operations and Financial Performance



Outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Substantially all of our revenues and workforce are concentrated in China. In response to the intensifying efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Chinese government took a number of actions, which included extending the Chinese New Year holiday, quarantining individuals suspected of having COVID-19, asking residents in China to stay at home and to avoid public gathering, among other things.



On the basis of scientific assessment of the characteristics of the virus and the pandemic situation, as well as reference to the prevention practices of other countries, at the end of 2022, the Chinese government refined its COVID-19 prevention and control measures and stopped conducting nucleic acid testing for all residents. By the end of 2022, vaccination rate has exceeded 90%. And normal life is returning. Under such circumstances, the government has taken positive service measures, including tax incentives, bank loan and financial support, etc, to support domestic enterprises to overcome difficulties. The market consolidation will be expedited eventually.



Since we resumed business operations after the outbreak of COVID-19, the Company kept continuous attention on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and reacted actively to its impact on the financial position and operating results of the Company. As of the date of the annual report, COVID-19’s adverse impacts on the company’s financial position and operating result as of December 31, 2022 were limited.

Our Business



We, through our PRC Subsidiaries and VIE, engage in production and distribution of three categories of paper products: corrugating medium paper, offset printing paper, tissue paper products and medical face masks in China.
Our principal executive offices are located at Science Park, Juli Road, Xushui District, Baoding City, Hebei Province, People’s Republic of China.



Our telephone number is (86) 312-869-8215. Our website is located at https://www.itpackaging.cn.



Manufacturing Process



Corrugating Medium Paper and Offset Printing Paper



Our current products (excluding tissue paper products) generally undergo two stages of manufacturing: (1) creating pulp from recycled paper products, and (2) treating the pulp and molding it into the desired types of paper products. A brief overview of the pulp and papermaking process is provided below.
Pulping



The recycled waste paper is first sorted by machine, and then broken down and beaten or smashed into small pieces using water and mechanical energy. It is then put through a course screening drum, followed by a fine screening drum to separate different grades of pulp, a process that we refer as “concentration”. In order to purify the pulp further, an approach flow system is used to filter out any impurities or inconsistencies, such as sand, in the pulp.
Paper Making



The pulp is sieved to remove the excess water and molded into a specific size. The moisture content is further reduced by applying hydraulic pressure to the pulp. The pulp then enters the drying section where it is rolled over by heated cylinders. The dried paper is then coated with a mixture of clay, white pigment and binder to produce a surface on which ink can sit without being fully absorbed, enabling crisper, and more consistent print quality.



The paper goes through a process called calendaring, which flattens and smoothens the paper into long sheets. The paper is then wound onto a reel that is mounted in a roll-slitting machine for rewinding, during which cutters are used to cut the paper into the desired widths. Upon completion, the rolls are fitted with sleeves and labeled, and then sent to quality control before shipment or storage.

Base Tissue Paper



While we make tissue paper products, we currently purchase paper pulp from suppliers and use it to manufacture base tissue paper directly.



Products



Corrugating medium paper



Corrugating medium paper, or CMP is used in the manufacturing of cardboard. Since the launch of our new Paper Machine (“PM6”) production line in December 2011, corrugating medium paper has become a major product of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2022, corrugating medium paper comprised approximately 99.42% of our total paper production quantities and roughly 98.38% of our total revenue. Raw materials used in the production of corrugating medium paper include recycled paper board (or Old Corrugating Cardboard or “OCC,” as it is commonly referred to in the United States) and certain supplementary agents. In January 2013, we suspended the operation of our PM1 production line for renovation, which was then used to produce corrugating medium paper. In May 2014, we launched the commercial production of a renovated PM1 production line. The renovated PM1 production line produces light-weight corrugating medium paper with a specification of 40 to 80 grams per square meter (“g/s/m”). PM1’s light-weight corrugating medium paper products have a wide range of commercial applications. For example, they can be used as a construction material for wall and floor insulation or to manufacture moisture-proof packaging materials for the transportation of books and magazines by the publishing industry. It can also be used as corrugating medium to make corrugating cardboard for packaging that requires light-weight boxes. The manufacturing process of light-weight corrugating medium paper is similar to that of the regular corrugating medium paper and also uses recycled paper boards as a major source of raw material. We now have two corrugating medium paper production lines, PM6 and PM1. We refer to products produced from the PM6 production line as Regular CMP and products produced from the PM1 production line as Light-Weight CMP.



Offset printing paper



Offset printing paper is used for offset printing in the publishing industry. Revenue from offset printing paper was $nil for the year ended December 31, 2022. Raw materials used in making offset printing paper include recycled white scrap paper, fluorescent whitening agent and sizing agent. We currently have two production lines, PM2 and PM3, for the production of offset printing paper.



Tissue Paper Products



We began the commercial production of tissue paper products in Wei County Industry Park in June 2015. We process base tissue paper purchased from long-term cooperative third party and produce finished tissue paper products, including toilet paper, boxed and soft-packed tissues, handkerchief tissues and paper napkins, as well as bathroom and kitchen paper towels that are marketed and sold under the Dongfang Paper brand. In December 2018 and November 2019, we completed the construction, installation and test of operation of PM8 and PM9, respectively, and commercially launched tissue paper production of PM8 and PM9 at such time. On May 5, 2020, the Company announced it planned the commercial launch of a new tissue paper production line PM10 and the Company entered into an agreement to purchase paper machine with paper machine supplier. The Company expected the new tissue paper production line to be launched after the completion of trial run. The machine supplier was delayed because of pandemic. We are closely following up the provider for further actions. Tissue paper products comprised approximately 0.58% of our total paper production quantities and approximately 1.36% of our total sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Face Masks



On April 29, 2020, we launched a production line of non-medical single-use face masks, following the completion of raw materials preparation, trial run of the equipment and the sample products inspection. In May 2021, the Company obtained the license for its new single-use surgical masks from local food and drug administration in Hebei province, and began commercial production in November 2021.

We target corporate customers in the middle range of the marketplace, where, with solid quality and competitive pricing, we see potential for high volume growth for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper. Our primary market has been the region of North China, especially in the province of Hebei.
Our Production Lines



During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had six PM production lines in operation and are in the process of launching one more that are designated as PM7. These production lines include the followings:

PM# | Paper Product Produced | Designed Capacity (tonnes/year) | Owned by | Operated by | Status as of December 31, 2022 
-----+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------

On December 31, 2009, we acquired a digital photo paper production line, including two coating lines that are designated as PM4 and PM5 and ancillary equipment, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.6 million. We suspended production of photo paper in June 2016.



In order to meet the growing domestic demand for paper, which we believe currently exceeds domestic supply in the case of corrugating medium paper, especially in the region of North China, we installed a corrugating medium paper production line (PM6) with a designed capacity of 360,000 tonnes per year. We completed the installation of the PM6 production line in November 2011 and began commercial production in December 2011.



We have implemented a plan to renovate one of the old production lines that has been idle since the end of 2007. We previously made paper with anti-counterfeit features from that production line. When the renovation is completed, we intend to use the renovated production line to produce high-profit margin specialty papers. Our current plan is to complete the renovation project, put in place a new production and marketing team and launch the renovated production line as PM7 by the end of 2023.



On November 27, 2012, we signed a 15-year lease relating to approximately 49.4 acres of land in the Economic Development Zone in Wei County, Hebei Province, China for the purpose of developing a new tissue paper production plant. We planned to build two tissue paper production lines, each with 15,000 tonnes/year capacity, and other packaging facilities and infrastructures on the leased land. In December 2012, we signed a contract with an equipment contractor in Shanghai to build PM8, the first of our two tissue paper production lines in Wei County. In December 2018 and November 2019, we completed the construction, installation and test of operation of PM8 and PM9, respectively and commercially launched tissue paper productions of PM8 and PM9 at such time. On May 5, 2020, the Company announced it planned the commercial launch of a new tissue paper production line PM10 and the Company signed an agreement to purchase paper machine with paper machine supplier. The Company expected the new tissue paper production line to be launched after the completion of trial run.



We voluntarily renovated our 150,000 tonnes/year corrugating medium paper PM1 in anticipation of increased regulatory concerns on energy efficiencies as well as to improve the quality of our corrugating medium products. Rather than converting PM1 to a regular corrugating medium paper machine, we decided in 2013 that, based on the market conditions and our waste water treatment capability, the better option was to convert PM1 to produce Light-Weight CMP with a specification of 40 to 80 grams per square meter (“g/s/m”) with a designed capacity of 60,000 tonnes/year. We started the renovation in January 2013 and launched commercial production of the renovated PM1 production line in May 2014.



Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers



The supplies used in our production processes are comprised mainly of recycled paper board and unprinted recycled white scrap paper, both of which are ready-to-use items and available from multiple domestic and foreign sources. We currently purchase all of our recycled paper supplies from some domestic recycling stations and do not rely on imported recycled paper. We also purchase gas and chemical agents from nearby suppliers. Ongoing inflationary pressures and higher demand for recycled paper could lead to an increase in our costs of raw materials and production, which we may or may not be able to pass to our customers.



We sign annual raw materials supplier contracts with our suppliers. Although we have contracts with our suppliers, these contracts do not lock-in the purchase price of our raw materials or provide hedge against the fluctuation in the market price of these raw materials. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had two large suppliers which accounted for approximately 76% and 15% of our total purchases, respectively.



For the year ended December 31, 2022, three major suppliers who individually accounted for more than 5% of our total purchase are as follows:




 | 2022 | | 
----------------------+----------+------------+---------
 | Purchase | | % of 
 | Amount | | Total 
 | (USD$) | | Purchase
Company A (Hebei) | | 66,560,547 | | 76 | %
Company B (Hebei) | | 12,955,766 | | 15 | %
Company C (Hebei) | | 4,864,447 | | 6 | %
Total Major Suppliers | | 84,103,790 | | 97 | %

Huatai is the first Shandong papermaker to publicly list its stock and has become a famous brand in China. Its annual paper production is estimated to have reached 4 million tonnes.



Nine Dragons Paper (Holdings) Limited (“ND Paper”), based in Guangdong Province (located in southern China), is the largest paper manufacturer in China and primarily produces craft paper and high-strength corrugating medium paper with annual capacity of 13 million tonnes. ND Paper has reported that it has five production lines in the city of Tianjin with a total designed capacity of 2.15 million tonnes, producing products such as craft paper, high strength corrugating medium paper and grey-back duplex board.



Sun Paper Group, Ltd., based in Shandong Province, primarily produces card paper, whiteboard paper and art paper. It also produces alkaline peroxide mechanical pulp, sourced in part from wood chips harvested by the company’s poplar plantations. This company has reported that it has an aggregate annual production capacity of paper and pulp of approximately 5.7 million tonnes and has been listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange since 2006.



With the exceptions of Chenming and ND Paper, which may compete directly with us in the offset printing paper market and the corrugating medium paper market, respectively, in the Beijing/Tianjin/greater Hebei regions, we believe that we face only indirect competition from the above-listed companies, either because we have a different product assortment from these companies, or because, to the extent they do offer products similar to ours, the transportation costs and storage costs make it difficult for these companies to compete effectively with us on pricing.



Our Competitive Edge



Regional advantage (Northern China). We believe that Dongfang Paper is one of the leading papermaking enterprises in Hebei Province. Our proximity to large urban centers in northern China, Beijing and Tianjin, gives us access to a large market to sell our products.



There are other paper manufacturers that are also located in Hebei Province (and close to metropolitan Beijing and Tianjin areas), but most of these other manufacturers are small in scale and unable to compete with us effectively. We also compete with other large printing paper manufacturers for Beijing printing company customers. We believe that we have cost and geographical advantages over these larger competitors.



Cost advantage. Unlike some of our out-of-province competitors who must set up interim warehouses and ship products from their production base to such interim warehouses close to their customer base in Beijing, there is no need for us to set up interim warehouses, because we are approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Beijing, the cultural center of China and our largest target market. While we do not separately pay for transportation cost on raw material purchases, the transportation cost included in the raw material purchase prices from our recycled paper suppliers is lower than the transportation cost paid by our competitors in the province of Shandong. Similarly, our customers pay lower transportation cost to pick up their orders from our finished goods warehouse in Baoding than what they would pay if they had to pick up goods from locations further away from Beijing. Tianjin, another large urban center, is also approximately 60 miles from our facilities. Baoding city itself is also home to numerous printing and packaging companies. Our geographical advantage and easy access to low-cost raw materials allow us to implement a more flexible inventory purchase policy, lower our purchase prices and inventory management expenses and reduce our production cost. As such, we have lower freight costs and other associated costs of sales, which enable us to charge lower prices, if necessary, for our products. Additionally, because we buy all recycled paper raw materials from Beijing and Tianjin, rather than from the United States or Japan, our purchase lead time is shorter as compared to manufacturers who rely on imported recycled paper.

Research and Development



Our R&D activities are carried out by a task force led by a group of senior managers (in charge of product development and quality control) and by a group of selected engineers and technicians. The Company charged the time spent on the R&D projects (manufacturing waste discharge recycling, digital photo paper and tissue paper manufacturing) to R&D expenses. Our R&D efforts in 2022has focused on evaluating and developing new products that are in the pipeline for 2022 and included developing and improving the manufacturing process of Light-Weight CMP and the production and packaging technology of tissue paper.



One of our production lines, PM7, is under renovation. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, we have spent approximately $1.57 million in machine parts and new components to renovate this production line, with which we expect to produce certain specialty papers, including wood-grain deco and furniture paper, wallpaper and paper with security features (for anti-counterfeiting purposes). While we are optimistic about the prospect of the specialty papers, we cannot guarantee the launch of the specialty paper production (which is tentatively scheduled by the end of 2023) or the success of such renovation.

Domain names

Government Regulation



The testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, advertising and marketing, post-approval safety reporting and export of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the PRC. We are also subject to various other regulations and permit requirements by the Chinese government. These regulations and their impact on our business are set forth in more details below.
Environmental Regulation



Our operations and facilities are subject to environmental laws and regulations stipulated by the national and the local environment protection bureaus in the PRC.



Since the implementation of the State Council’s “Decisions on Environmental Protection Issues” in 1996, the PRC paper industry has been subject to more rigorous environmental standards. Effective January 1, 2015, a new law promulgated by the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China makes certain violations of the environmental laws a criminal offense. We believe that we are one of the few major paper manufacturers in Hebei Province that have obtained a Pollution Discharge Permit. We initially received the permit in September 1996 and, we have successfully renewed the permit each year by complying with applicable environmental requirements.



On December 24, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress issued Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution (the “Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution Law”), which became effective on June 5, 2022. According to the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution Law, entities subject to the pollutant discharge licensing management requirements shall not emit industrial noise without a pollutant discharge permit and shall prevent and control noise pollution according to the requirements of the pollutant discharge permit. The noise pollution has been included in the Pollution Discharge Permit, and we conduct quarterly test on the noise through qualified testing institutions to comply with the laws, which is required by laws.

Waste Water Treatment



Dongfang Paper uses a multi-level water recycling process. Waste water from the pulping process is fed into collection pools, where it is divided into two parts, water and recovered pulp fiber. The latter is returned to the pulping process.



Chemical agents are added to the waste water, and the waste water is fed into a biogas reactor and filtering pools, producing purified water and depositing sludge. Most of the purified water is recycled to produce corrugating medium paper and the sludge is pumped into a sludge pool, condensed and dehydrated. We then use the sludge as a raw material in the manufacture of corrugating medium paper.



We maintain computerized controls at our production facilities on a 24-hour basis to monitor compliance with environmental rules and regulations. We are not aware of any environmental investigations, prosecutions, disputes, claims or other environmental proceedings, nor have we been subject to any action by any environmental administration authorities of the PRC. To our knowledge, our operations meet or exceed the existing environmental requirements of the PRC.
