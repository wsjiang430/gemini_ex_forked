ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Forward Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains, and other periodic and current reports, press releases and other public stockholder communications of BankFinancial Corporation may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which involve significant risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements may include statements relating to our future plans, strategies and expectations, as well as our future revenues, expenses, earnings, losses, financial performance, financial condition, asset quality metrics and future prospects. Forward looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “continue,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are frequently based on assumptions that may or may not materialize, and are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements. We intend all forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for the purpose of invoking these safe harbor provisions.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated or projected and which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or future prospects include, but are not limited to: (i) less than anticipated loan growth due to intense competition for loans and leases, particularly in terms of pricing and credit underwriting; (ii) the impact of re-pricing and competitors’ pricing initiatives on loan and deposit products; (iii) interest rate movements and their impact on the economy, customer behavior and our net interest margin; (iv) adverse economic conditions in general and in the markets in which we lend that could result in increased delinquencies in our loan portfolio or a decline in the value of our investment securities and the collateral for our loans; (v) declines in real estate values that adversely impact the value of our loan collateral, other real estate owned ("OREO"), asset dispositions and the level of borrower equity in their investments; (vi) borrowers that experience legal or financial difficulties that we do not currently foresee; (vii) results of supervisory monitoring or examinations by regulatory authorities, including the possibility that a regulatory authority could, among other things, require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or adversely change our loan classifications, write-down assets, reduce credit concentrations or maintain specific capital levels; (viii) changes, disruptions or illiquidity in national or global financial markets; (ix) the credit risks of lending activities, including risks that could cause changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs or changes in estimates relating to the computation of our allowance for loan losses; (x) monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; (xi) factors affecting our ability to access deposits or cost-effective funding, and the impact of competitors' pricing initiatives on our deposit products; (xii) legislative or regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on our products, services, operations and operating expenses; (xiii) higher federal deposit insurance premiums; (xiv) higher than expected overhead, infrastructure and compliance costs; (xv) changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; (xvi) the effects of the federal government shutdown; and (xvii) privacy and cybersecurity risks, including the risks of business interruption and the compromise of confidential customer information resulting from intrusions.
These risks and uncertainties, as well as the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A below, should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the future, or to reflect circumstances and events that occur after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made.
BankFinancial Corporation
BankFinancial Corporation, a Maryland corporation headquartered in Burr Ridge, Illinois (the “Company”), became the owner of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of BankFinancial, F.S.B. (the “Bank”) in 2005, when we consummated a plan of conversion and reorganization that the Bank and its predecessor holding companies, BankFinancial MHC, Inc. and BankFinancial Corporation, a federal corporation, adopted on August 25, 2004. BankFinancial Corporation, the Maryland corporation, was organized in 2004 to facilitate the mutual-to-stock conversion and to become the holding company for the Bank upon its completion.
Following the approval of applications that the Company filed with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bank filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Company became a bank holding company and the Bank became a national bank on November 30, 2016. As a result of the Bank’s conversion from a federal savings bank charter to a national bank charter, the Bank changed its name from BankFinancial, F.S.B. to BankFinancial, National Association.
We manage our operations as one unit, and thus do not have separate operating segments. Our chief operating decision-makers use consolidated results to make operating and strategic decisions.

BankFinancial, National Association
The Bank is a full-service, national bank principally engaged in the business of commercial, family and personal banking. The Bank offers our customers a broad range of loan, deposit, and other financial products and services through 19 full-service Illinois based banking offices located in Cook, DuPage, Lake and Will Counties, and through our Internet Branch, www.bankfinancial.com.
The Bank’s primary business is making loans and accepting deposits. The Bank also offers our customers a variety of financial products and services that are related or ancillary to loans and deposits, including cash management, funds transfers, bill payment and other online and mobile banking transactions, automated teller machines, safe deposit boxes, trust services, wealth management, and general insurance agency services.
The Bank’s primary lending area consists of the counties where our branch offices are located, and contiguous counties in the State of Illinois. In 2018, we derived the most significant portion of our revenues from these geographic areas. However, we also engage in multi-family lending activities in selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas outside our primary lending area and engage in healthcare lending and commercial leasing activities on a nationwide basis. 
We originate deposits predominantly from the areas where our branch offices are located. We rely on our favorable locations, customer service, competitive pricing, our Internet Branch and related deposit services such as cash management to attract and retain these deposits. While we accept certificates of deposit in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) deposit insurance limits, we generally do not solicit such deposits because they are more difficult to retain than core deposits and at times are more costly than wholesale deposits.
Lending Activities
Our loan portfolio consists primarily of multi-family real estate, nonresidential real estate, construction and land loans, commercial loans and commercial leases, which represented $1.259 billion, or 94.6%, of our gross loan portfolio of $1.331 billion at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, $619.9 million, or 46.6%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multi-family mortgage loans; $152.4 million, or 11.5%, of our loan portfolio consisted of nonresidential real estate loans; $172,000 of our loan portfolio consisted of construction and land loans; $187.4 million, or 14.1%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans; and $299.4 million, or 22.5%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial leases. $70.4 million, or 5.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, of which $13.2 million, or 1.0%, were loans to investors secured by non-owner occupied residential properties, including home equity loans and lines of credit.
Deposit Activities
Our deposit accounts consist principally of savings accounts, NOW accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and IRAs and other retirement accounts. We provide commercial checking accounts and related services such as cash management. We also provide low-cost checking account services. We rely on our favorable locations, customer service, competitive pricing, our Internet Branch and related deposit services such as cash management to attract and retain deposit accounts.
At December 31, 2018, our deposits totaled $1.352 billion. Interest-bearing deposits totaled $1.122 billion, or 83.0% of total deposits, and noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled $230.0 million, or 17.0% of total deposits. Savings, money market and NOW account deposits totaled $684.1 million, or 50.6% of total deposits, and certificates of deposit totaled $438.3 million, or 32.4% of total deposits, of which $290.2 million had maturities of one year or less.
Related Products and Services
The Bank provides trust and financial planning services through our Trust Department. The Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Assurance Services, Inc. (“Financial Assurance”), sells property and casualty insurance and other insurance products on an agency basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Financial Assurance recorded a net loss of $48,000. At December 31, 2018, Financial Assurance had two full-time employees. The Bank’s other wholly-owned subsidiary, BFIN Asset Recovery Company, LLC (formerly BF Asset Recovery Corporation), holds title to and sells certain Bank-owned real estate acquired through foreclosure and collection actions, and recorded a net loss of $405,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Website and Stockholder Information
The website for the Company and the Bank is www.bankfinancial.com. Information on this website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company makes available, free of charge, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, its Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities 
2

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after such forms are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Copies of these documents are available to stockholders at the website for the Company and the Bank, www.bankfinancial.com, under “Investor Relations,” and through the EDGAR database on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov.
Competition
We face significant competition in originating loans and attracting deposits. The Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area and the other markets in which we operate generally have a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger institutions that have greater financial resources than we have, and many of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Our competition for loans and leases comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, the U.S. Government, credit unions, leasing companies, insurance companies, real estate conduits and other companies that provide financial services to businesses and individuals. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from online financial institutions and non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies.
We seek to meet this competition by emphasizing personalized service and efficient decision-making tailored to individual needs. We do not rely on any individual, group or entity for a material portion of our loans or our deposits.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had 208 full-time employees and 52 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our working relationship with our employees to be good.
Supervision and Regulation
General
In 2016, the Bank converted from a federal savings bank charter to a national bank charter. As a national bank, the Bank is regulated and supervised primarily by the OCC. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC in more limited circumstances because the Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC. This regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of the activities in which a depository institution may engage, and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund, depositors and the banking system. Under this system of federal regulation, depository institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. The OCC examines the Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its Board of Directors on any identified deficiencies, if any. After completing an examination, the OCC issues a report of examination and assigns a rating (known as an institution’s CAMELS rating). Under federal law and regulations, an institution may not disclose the contents of its reports of examination or its CAMELS ratings to the public.
The Bank is a member of, and owns stock in, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLB”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) has limited regulatory jurisdiction over the Bank with regard to reserves it must maintain against deposits, check processing and certain other matters. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated in some respects by both federal and state laws, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts, and the form and content of the Bank’s consumer loan documents.
The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of federal law. As such, it is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB. The Company was previously a savings and loan holding company but became a bank holding company in connection with the Bank’s conversion to a national bank charter on November 30, 2016.
There can be no assurance that laws, rules and regulations, and regulatory policies will not change in the future. Such changes could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Any change in the laws or regulations, or in regulatory policy, whether by the OCC, the FDIC, the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) or the United States ("U.S.") Congress could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank and their respective operations.
The following summary of laws and regulations applicable to the Bank and Company is not intended to be exhaustive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved.
Federal Banking Regulation
Business Activities. As a national bank, the Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the National Bank Act, as amended, and the regulations of the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by 
3

residential and nonresidential real estate, commercial business and consumer loans and leases, certain types of securities and certain other loans and assets. Unlike federal savings banks, national banks are not generally subject to specified percentage of assets on various types of lending. The Bank may also establish subsidiaries that engage in activities permitted for the Bank as well as certain other activities.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including national banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8% and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).
For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets a bank has for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance-sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages and certain qualifying multi-family mortgage loans, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial, commercial real estate and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and high volatility commercial real estate loans, and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement has been phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer was 1.875% during 2018.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements, the Bank was considered well-capitalized and it had an appropriate capital conservation buffer.
The Company and the Bank each have adopted Regulatory Capital Plans that provide that the Bank will maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 7.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.5%. The capital ratios set forth in the Regulatory Capital Plans will be adjusted if and as necessary. In accordance with the Regulatory Capital Plans, neither the Company nor the Bank will pursue any acquisition or growth opportunity, declare any dividend or conduct any stock repurchase that would cause the Bank's total risk-based capital ratio and/or its Tier 1 leverage ratio to fall below the established capital levels. In addition, in accordance with its Regulatory Capital Plan, the Company will continue to maintain its ability to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank by holding at least $5.0 million of cash or liquid assets for that purpose.
Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements.
Loans-to-One-Borrower. A national bank generally may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and 
4

surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
Dividends.  Federal law and OCC regulations govern cash dividends by a national bank. A national bank is authorized to pay such dividends from undivided profits but must receive prior OCC approval if the total amount of dividends (including the proposed dividend) exceeds its net income in that year and the prior two years less dividends previously paid. A national bank may not pay a dividend if it does not comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements and may be further limited in payment of cash dividends if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer described previously.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All national banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a national bank, the OCC is required to evaluate and rate the bank’s record of compliance with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices based on the characteristics specified in those statutes. A national bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on certain of its activities such as branching or mergers. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. The Bank’s CRA performance has been rated as “Outstanding” by its primary federal regulatory agency since 1998.
Transactions with Related Parties. A national bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by OCC regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation W. The term “affiliates” for these purposes generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an insured depository institution, although operating subsidiaries of national banks are generally not considered affiliates for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are at least as favorable to the national bank as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the bank’s capital. Collateral in specified amounts must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans or other forms of credit from the bank.
The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the FRB. These provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders generally be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features (subject to an exception for lending programs open to employees generally). In addition, there are limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate based on a percentage of the Bank’s capital. Extensions of credit in excess of specified limits must receive the prior approval of the Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions. The Bank does not extend new credit to executive officers or members of the Board of Directors.
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over national banks. This includes authority to bring enforcement actions against the Bank, its directors, officers and employees and all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to the removal of officers and/or directors, receivership, conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance. Civil monetary penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC has authority to recommend to the OCC that an enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular insured bank. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for insured depository institutions under its jurisdiction. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address matters such as internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. A subsequent set of guidelines was issued for information security. If the OCC determines that a national bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, it may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard and take other appropriate action.
5

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Federal law requires that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The applicable OCC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
The regulations provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a national bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for the bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the bank’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, including as to growth and capital distributions, also apply to “undercapitalized” institutions. If an “undercapitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions must comply with one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the OCC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized a requirement to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss officers or directors and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.”
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured up to $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Until July 1, 2016, insured depository institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s rate depended upon the risk category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 
Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund's reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets to a range of 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank cannot predict what its insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
An insured institution’s deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon an administrative finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980’s 
6

to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO began maturing in 2017 and continue to mature through 2019.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. National banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Reserve System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in its regional Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in specified amounts. The Bank is also required to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against its transaction accounts, such as negotiable order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the OCC’s regulations. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with all of these requirements. The FRB also provides a backup source of funding to depository institutions through the regional Federal Reserve Banks pursuant to section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation A. In general, eligible depository institutions have access to three types of discount window credit-primary credit, secondary credit, and seasonal credit. All discount window loans must be collateralized to the satisfaction of the lending regional Federal Reserve Bank.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in specified amounts. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act
The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to develop programs to detect and report money-laundering and terrorist activities, as well as suspicious activities. The USA PATRIOT Act also gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies are required to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. In addition, non-compliance with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and other enforcement measures. We have developed policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these laws and regulations.
Holding Company Regulation
The Company, as a company controlling a national bank, is a bank holding company subject to regulation and supervision by, and reporting to, the FRB. The FRB has enforcement authority over the Company and any nonbank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the Bank.
The Company's activities are limited to the activities permissible for bank holding companies, which generally include activities deemed by the FRB to be closely related or a proper incident to banking or managing or controlling banks. A bank holding company that meets certain criteria may elect to be regulated as a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities, such as underwriting equity securities and insurance. The Company has not, up to now, elected to be regulated as a financial holding company.
Federal law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of a class of voting securities of, or all or substantially all of the assets of, another bank or bank holding company, without prior written approval of the FRB. In evaluating applications by bank holding companies to acquire banks, the FRB considers, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the parties, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and needs of the community, competitive factors and compliance with anti-money laundering laws.
Capital. Bank holding companies with greater than $3 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The asset threshold was previously $1 billion, which applied to the Company, but federal legislation required the FRB to raise the threshold to $3 billion. That change became effective on August 30, 2018. As a result, holding companies of less than $3 billion of assets are not subject to consolidated capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the FRB.
Source of Strength Doctrine. The “source of strength doctrine” requires bank holding companies to provide assistance to their subsidiary depository institutions in the event the subsidiary depository institution experiences financial difficulty. The FRB has

issued regulations requiring that all bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.
Capital Distributions. The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances, such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. FRB regulatory guidance also indicates that a bank holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. FRB regulations require prior approval for a bank holding company to redeem equity securities if the gross consideration, when combined with net consideration paid for all such redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the holding company’s consolidated net worth. There is an exception for bank holding companies that meet specified qualitative criteria. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Change in Control Regulations
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the FRB has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquiror and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with the Company, the issuer has securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to public concerns regarding corporate accountability in connection with certain accounting scandals. The stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally applies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, under the Exchange Act.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act includes specific additional disclosure requirements, requires the SEC and national securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related rules, and mandates further studies of certain issues by the SEC.
Federal Securities Laws
The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the Exchange Act.
