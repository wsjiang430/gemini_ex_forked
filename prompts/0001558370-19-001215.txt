 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 Founded in 1965, Stoneridge, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive, commercial, off-highway, motorcycle and agricultural vehicle markets. Our products and systems are critical elements in the management of mechanical and electrical systems to improve overall vehicle performance, convenience and monitoring in areas such as emissions control, fuel efficiency, safety, security and infotainment. Our extensive footprint encompasses 26 locations in 13 countries and enables us to supply global and regional automotive, commercial, off-highway, motorcycle and agricultural vehicle markets.
 Our custom-engineered products and systems are used to activate equipment and accessories, monitor and display vehicle performance and control, distribute electrical power and signals and provide vehicle security and convenience. Our product offerings consist of (i) sensors, (ii) application-specific actuators, switches and valves, (iii) vehicle and driver information systems, (iv) vehicle management electronics, (v) power and switch distribution modules and telematics, (vi) camera-based vision systems and monitors, (vii) security alarms and vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and (viii) convenience accessories. We supply the majority of our products, predominantly on a sole-source basis, to many of the world’s leading commercial vehicle and automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and select non-vehicle OEMs, as well as certain commercial vehicle and automotive Tier 1 suppliers. Our customers are increasingly utilizing electronic technology to comply with more stringent regulations (particularly emissions and safety) and to meet end-user demand for improved vehicle performance and greater convenience. As a result of this trend, per-vehicle electronic content has been increasing. Our technology and our partnership-oriented approach to product design and development enables us to develop next-generation products for this trend.
 On January 31, 2017, the Company acquired Exploitatiemaatschappij Berghaaf B.V. (“Orlaco”), an electronics business which designs, manufactures and sells camera-based vision systems, monitors and related products. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements herein include the results of Orlaco from the acquisition date to December 31, 2018. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the Orlaco acquisition.
 The Company had a 74% controlling interest in PST Eletronica Ltda. (“PST”) from December 31, 2011 through May 15, 2017. On May 16, 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 26% noncontrolling interest in PST, which was accounted for as an equity transaction. As such, PST is now a wholly owned subsidiary. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisition of PST’s noncontrolling interest.
 Beginning with the divestiture of our wiring business in 2014, we accelerated a shift in our product portfolio towards smart products, or those products which contain embedded electronics or logic.  While the wiring business was our largest single business, based on revenues and employees, and the business that the Company was founded on, it was largely a commodity that did not provide a technology platform to drive our expected future growth.  In addition to the divestiture of the wiring business, we deployed capital in 2017 to make strategic investments including the acquisition of Orlaco, our partner on the development of MirrorEye, our camera monitoring system, and the acquisition of 100 percent of our PST business in Brazil.  These activities have acted as a catalyst for the advancement of our smart product portfolio, increasing our smart content from just over 50 percent of our sales in 2014 to almost 75% of our sales in 2018.  Our product portfolio shift focuses on the megatrends driving the transportation industry.
 Segments and Products
 We conduct our business in three reportable business segments which are the same as our operating segments: Control Devices, Electronics and PST.
 Control Devices. Our Control Devices segment designs and manufactures products that monitor, measure or activate specific functions within a vehicle. This segment includes product lines such as sensors, actuators, valves and switches. Sensor products are employed in major vehicle systems such as the emissions, safety, powertrain, braking, climate

control, steering and suspension systems. Actuator products enable OEMs to deploy power functions in a vehicle and can be designed to integrate switching and control functions including our park and shift by wire products. Switches transmit signals that activate specific functions. Our switch technology is principally used in two capacities, user-activated and hidden. User-activated switches are used by a vehicle’s operator or passengers to manually activate in-vehicle accessories. Hidden switches are not typically visible to vehicle operators or passengers and are engaged to activate or deactivate selected functions as part of normal vehicle operations. We sell these products principally to the automotive market. To a lesser extent, we also sell these products to the commercial vehicle and agricultural markets.
 Electronics. Our Electronics segment designs and manufactures electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units, driver information systems, camera-based vision systems, monitors and related products. These products collect, store and display vehicle information such as speed, pressure, maintenance data, trip information, operator performance, temperature, distance traveled and driver messages related to vehicle performance. In addition, power distribution modules and systems regulate, coordinate, monitor and direct the operation of the electrical system within a vehicle. These products use state-of-the-art hardware, software and multiplexing technology and are sold principally to the commercial vehicle market through both the OEM and aftermarket channels. The camera-based vision systems, monitors and related products are sold principally to the off-highway vehicle market.
 PST. Our PST segment primarily serves the South American market and specializes in the design, manufacture and sale of in-vehicle audio and video devices, electronic vehicle security alarms, convenience accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services primarily for the automotive and motorcycle markets. This segment includes product lines such as alarms, convenience applications, vehicle monitoring and tracking devices and infotainment systems. These products improve the performance, safety and convenience features of our customers’ vehicles. PST sells its products through the aftermarket distribution channel, to factory authorized dealer installers, also referred to as original equipment services, direct to OEMs and through mass merchandisers. In addition, monitoring services and tracking devices are sold directly to corporate and individual customers.

Segment | Product Category | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Control Devices | Sensors, switches, valves and actuators | 51 | % | 54 | % | 59 | %
Electronics | Electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units driver information systems and camera-based vision systems | 40 | | 34 | | 29 | 
PST | Security alarms, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and convenience accessories | 9 | | 12 | | 12 | 

      Our products and systems are sold to numerous OEM and Tier 1 customers, as well as aftermarket distributors and mass merchandisers, for use on many different vehicle platforms. We supply multiple parts to many of our principal OEM and Tier 1 customers under requirements contracts for a particular vehicle model. These contracts range in duration from one year to the production life of the model, which commonly extends for three to seven years.
 The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the percentage of net sales derived from our principal end markets for the years ended December 31:

Principal End Markets | | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Automotive | | 41 | % | 46 | % | 50 | %
Commercial vehicle | | 33 | | 29 | | 33 | 
Aftermarket distributors, mass merchandisers and monitoring services | 9 | | 12 | | 12 | 
Off-highway and other | | 17 | | 13 | | 5 | 

      For further information related to our reportable segments and financial information about geographic areas, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

 Production Materials
 The principal production materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are molded plastic components and resins, copper, steel, precious metals and certain electrical components such as printed circuit boards, semiconductors, microprocessors, memory devices, resistors, capacitors, fuses, relays, infotainment devices and cameras. We purchase production materials pursuant to both annual contract and spot purchasing methods. Such materials are available from multiple sources, but we generally establish collaborative relationships with a qualified supplier for each of our key production materials in order to lower costs and enhance service and quality. As global demand for our production materials increases, we may have difficulties obtaining adequate production materials from our suppliers to satisfy our customers. Any extended period of time for which we cannot obtain adequate production material or which we experience an increase in the price of production material would materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property
 We maintain and have pending various U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to the reportable segments of our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect the Company’s interests in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe any single patent is material to our business, nor would the expiration or invalidity of any patent have a material adverse effect on our business or ability to compete. Industry Cyclicality and Seasonality
 The markets for products in each of our reportable segments have been cyclical. Because these products are used principally in the production of vehicles for the automotive, commercial, off-highway, motorcycle and agricultural vehicle markets, revenues and therefore results of operations, are significantly dependent on the general state of the economy and other factors, like the impact of environmental regulations on our customers and end market consumers, which affect these markets. A significant decline in automotive, commercial, off-highway, motorcycle and agricultural vehicle production of our principal customers could adversely impact the Company. Our Electronics and Control Devices segments are typically not affected by seasonality, however the demand for our PST segment consumer products is typically higher in the second half of the year, the fourth quarter in particular. Customers
 We have several customers which account for a significant percentage of our sales. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to these customers, or the loss of a significant customer, would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We supply numerous different products to each of our principal customers. Contracts with several of our customers provide for supplying their requirements for a particular model, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model, which is generally three to seven years. These contracts are subject to potential renegotiation from time to time, which may affect product pricing and generally may be terminated by our customers at any time. Therefore, the loss of a contract for a major model or a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers would have a material adverse impact on the Company. We may enter into contracts to supply products, the introduction of which may then be delayed or cancelled. We also compete to supply products for successor models, and are therefore subject to the risk that the customer will not select the Company to produce products on any such model, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Due to the competitive nature of the markets we serve, we face pricing pressures from our customers in the ordinary course of business. In response to these pricing pressures we have been able to effectively manage our production costs by the combination of lowering certain costs and limiting the increase of others, the net impact of which has not been material. However, if we are unable to effectively manage production costs in the future to mitigate future pricing pressures, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

 The following table presents our principal customers, as a percentage of net sales:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Ford Motor Company | 12 | % | 14 | % | 17 | %
Volvo | 8 | | 6 | | 6 | 
Daimler | 6 | | 6 | | 6 | 
General Motors Company | 5 | | 7 | | 7 | 
MAN | 5 | | 3 | | 3 | 
Scania | 5 | | 5 | | 6 | 
Other | 59 | | 59 | | 55 | 

      Backlog
 The Company defines backlog as the cumulative remaining sales for awarded programs for the next five years. The Company’s backlog was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2018, compared to $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s estimated net sales may be impacted by various assumptions, including new program vehicle production levels, customer price reductions, currency exchange rates and program launch timing. In addition, the Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. These agreements may be terminated by customers at any time and, accordingly, expected net sales information does not represent firm orders or firm commitments. Competition
 The markets for our products in our reportable segments are highly competitive. We compete based on technological innovation, price, quality, performance, service and delivery. We compete for new business both at the beginning of the development of new models and upon the redesign of existing models for OEM customers. New model development generally begins two to five years before the marketing of such models to the public. Once a supplier has been selected to provide parts for a new program, an OEM customer will usually continue to purchase those parts from the selected supplier for the life of the program, although not necessarily for any model redesigns. We compete for aftermarket and mass merchandiser sales based on price, product functionality, quality and service.
 Our diversity in products creates a wide range of competitors, which vary depending on both market and geographic location. We compete based on strong customer relations and a fast and flexible organization that develops technically effective solutions at or below target price. We compete against the following companies:
 Control Devices. Our primary competitors include BorgWarner, Bosch, Continental AG, CTS Corporation, Delphi Technologies, Denso Corporation, ETO Magnetic Corp., GHSP, Kongsberg Automotive, Methode Electronics, NTK Technologies, Inc., Sensata, and ZF Friedrichshafen AG.
 Electronics. Our primary competitors include Actia Group, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental AG, Dongfeng Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., Hella KGaA Hueck & Co., Magneti Marelli S.p.A., Mekra Lang GmbH and Visteon.
 PST. Our primary competitors include Autotrac, CalAmp Corporation, Hinor, Ituran, Kostal, Lennox, MultiLaser, Onix, Pioneer Corporation, Sascar, Taramps and Tury.
 Product Development
 Our research and development efforts for our reportable segments are largely product design and development oriented and consist primarily of applying known technologies to customer requests. We work closely with our customers to solve customer requests using innovative approaches. The majority of our development expenses are related to customer-sponsored programs where we are involved in designing custom-engineered solutions for specific applications or for next generation technology. To further our vehicle platform penetration, we have also developed collaborative relationships with the design and engineering departments of key customers. These collaborative efforts have resulted in the development of new and complimentary products and the enhancement of existing products.

 While our engineering and product development departments are organized by market, our segments interact and collaborate on new products. The product development operations are complimented by technology groups in Barneveld, Netherlands; Campinas, Brazil; Canton, Massachusetts; Juarez, Mexico; Lexington, Ohio; Pune, India and Stockholm, Sweden.
 We use efficient and quality oriented work processes to address our customers’ high standards. Our product development technical resources include a full complement of computer-aided design and engineering software systems, including (i) virtual three-dimensional modeling, (ii) functional simulation and analysis capabilities and (iii) data links for rapid prototyping. These systems enable us to expedite product design and the manufacturing process to shorten the development time and ultimately time to market.
 We have further strengthened our electrical engineering competencies through investment in equipment such as (i) automotive electro-magnetic compliance test chambers, (ii) programmable automotive and commercial vehicle transient generators, (iii) circuit simulators and (iv) other environmental test equipment. Additional investment in 3‑D printing product machining equipment has allowed us to fabricate new product samples in a fraction of the time required historically. Our product development and validation efforts are supported by full service, on-site test labs at most manufacturing facilities, thus enabling cross-functional engineering teams to optimize the product, process and system performance before tooling initiation.
 We have invested, and will continue to invest heavily in technology to develop new products for our customers. Product development costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and manufacturing methods, to the extent not recoverable from the customer, are expensed as incurred. Such costs amounted to approximately $51.1 million, $48.9 million, and $40.2 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, or 5.9%, 5.9%, and 5.8% of net sales for these periods.
 We will continue to prioritize investment spending toward the design and development of new products over sustaining existing product programs for specific customers, which allows us to sell our products to multiple customers. The typical product development process takes three to five years to show tangible results. As part of our effort to evaluate our investment spending, we review our current product portfolio and adjust our spending to either accelerate or eliminate our investment in these products based on our position in the market and the potential of the market and product.
 Environmental and Other Regulations
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. We believe that our business, operations and facilities have been and are being operated in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,600 employees, approximately 76% of whom were located outside of the United States. Although we have no collective bargaining agreements covering U.S. employees, a significant number of employees located in Brazil, China, Estonia, Mexico, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom either (i) are represented by a union and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, or (ii) are covered by a work council or other employment arrangements required by law. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Joint Ventures
 We form joint ventures in various global markets in order to achieve several strategic objectives including (i) diversifying our business by expanding in high-growth regions, (ii) employing complementary design processes, growth technologies and intellectual capital, and (iii) realizing cost savings from combined sourcing.
 We have a 49% noncontrolling equity interest in Minda Stoneridge Instruments Ltd. (“MSIL”). Based in India, MSIL manufactures electromechanical/electronic instrumentation equipment and sensors primarily for the automotive, motorcycle and commercial vehicle markets. We leverage our investment in MSIL by sharing our knowledge and
