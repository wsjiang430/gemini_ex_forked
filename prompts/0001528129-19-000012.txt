Item 1. Business
Overview 
Laredo is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, and midstream and marketing services, primarily in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had assembled 120,617 net acres in the Permian Basin and had total proved reserves, presented on a three-stream basis, of 238,167 MBOE. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, LMS buys, sells, gathers and transports oil, natural gas and water primarily for the account of Laredo. 
We have identified one operating segment: exploration and production. Our midstream and marketing functions are integral to our exploration and production activities. We have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than discrete operating segments and we allocate capital resources on a project-by-project basis across our asset base without regard to individual areas. 
2018 operation highlights 

• | Produced a Company record average of 68,168 BOE per day in full-year 2018, resulting in production growth of 17% from full-year 2017


• | Grew the value of our proved reserves by 19% from year-end 2017


• | Reduced unit cash general and administrative ("G&A") expense by 16% in full-year 2018


• | Recognized $31.9 million of net cash benefits from LMS field infrastructure investments through reduced capital and operating costs and increased revenue

Our core assets
The Permian Basin is comprised of several distinct geological provinces, including the Midland Basin to the east, the Delaware Basin to the west and the Central Platform in the middle. Our primary development and production fairway is located on the east side of the Midland Basin, 35 miles east of Midland, Texas. Our acreage is largely contiguous in the neighboring Texas counties of Howard, Glasscock, Reagan, Sterling and Irion. We refer to this acreage block in this Annual Report as our "Permian-Garden City" area. As of December 31, 2018, we held 120,617 net acres in the Permian Basin, all of which were held in 248 sections in the Permian-Garden City area, with an average working interest of 97% in all Laredo-operated currently producing wells. 
We believe our acreage in the Permian-Garden City area is a resource play for multiple producing formations that make up a significant portion of the entire stratigraphic section. We are currently focusing the majority of our development activities on two horizontal drilling targets (Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations) that have multiple landing points within each target. In addition, we have also established the existence of additional producing formations, including the Lower Wolfcamp, Cline, Spraberry and Canyon. From our inception in 2006 through December 31, 2018, we have drilled and completed (i.e., the particular well is flowing) 314 horizontal wells in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp and 967 vertical wells in the Wolfberry interval. Of these 314 horizontal wells, 189 were horizontal Upper Wolfcamp wells and 125 were horizontal Middle Wolfcamp wells. We have also drilled and completed 33 horizontal Lower Wolfcamp wells and 64 horizontal Cline wells. We anticipate focusing our 2019 drilling program on the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations due to their lower development cost and superior production expectations. 
Beginning in mid-2012, we started focusing our horizontal activity on drilling longer laterals. Since that time our average lateral length has grown to 10,000 feet and longer in areas where our contiguous acreage position allows. In 2019, we plan to widen the spacing between our wells and focus on achieving cash flow neutrality. 
Because oil, NGL and natural gas prices and related margins continue to remain volatile, our board of directors approved a capital expenditures budget of approximately $365 million, based on annual benchmark averages of a $53.60 per barrel WTI NYMEX strip price and a $2.90 per MMBtu Henry Hub NYMEX strip price, for calendar year 2019, excluding non-budgeted acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. Our goal is to achieve cash flow neutrality, and therefore, our capital spending in 2019 will ultimately be influenced by commodity price changes, as well as any changes in service costs and drilling and completions efficiencies. Of this budget, approximately $300 million is allocated to drilling and completion activities and approximately $65 million is allocated to production facilities, land and other capitalized costs. Substantially all of the planned capital budget is anticipated to be invested in the Permian-Garden City area, primarily in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations. 
Our near-term strategy is to continue to concentrate our drilling activities on multi-well packages around our previously established production corridors that have the infrastructure in place to provide us the flexibility to most efficiently and economically drill wells at an attractive rate of return. In the later part of the second quarter of 2019, we plan to widen the spacing between our wells as we seek to increase capital efficiency. In addition, in response to the continued volatile commodity price environment and our stated goal of achieving cash flow neutrality, we anticipate decreasing the number of drilling rigs and/or completions crews that we use. We continue to use our existing data (and acquire new data) to optimize completion designs and well spacing within the development plan in order to enhance inventory and net asset value. We will also continue to pursue cost saving measures, but given the volatile commodity price environment, we are unsure what, if any, changes there will be to service costs. 
On December 31, 2018, we had a total of three drilling rigs drilling horizontal wells. Our current drilling schedule anticipates that we will utilize three horizontal rigs during the first part of 2019 and decrease our drilling rig count thereafter. We do not anticipate utilizing any vertical rigs throughout 2019. If we decrease our drilling rig count and/or completion crews, it will have a negative impact on our production, especially oil production, and reserves, as well as potentially result in contract termination penalties. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Obligations and commitments" and Note 14.c to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
In addition to the impact of commodity prices, the timing of drilling our potential locations is also influenced by several factors, including capital requirements and availability, the Texas Railroad Commission ("RRC") well-spacing requirements and the positive results from our ongoing development drilling program.
We expect our Permian-Garden City acreage to continue to be the primary driver for the growth of our reserves, production and cash flow for the foreseeable future.
Since our inception, we have established and realized our reserves, production and cash flow primarily through our drilling program, coupled with select strategic acquisitions. Our net proved reserves were estimated at 238,167 MBOE on a three-stream basis as of December 31, 2018, of which 91% are classified as proved developed reserves and 26% are attributed to oil reserves. We report our production volumes on a three-stream basis, which separately reports NGL from crude oil and natural gas. As part of our on-going reserves estimation process, for our year-end 2018 reserves estimation, we incorporated additional production data to reflect (i) the higher gas content and steeper oil declines on our historical wells and (ii) the negative effects on oil production from tighter spacing on our recent wells. This additional production history has led to more specific forecasts, including specific b-factors, for both developed and undeveloped locations as we take into account additional production data. There is inherent uncertainty in the reserves estimation process and therefore we will continue to monitor the future production of these wells as well as other available data. In this Annual Report, the information presented with respect to our estimated proved reserves has been prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), our independent reserve engineers, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") applicable to the periods presented. 
The following table summarizes our total estimated net proved reserves presented on a three-stream basis, net acreage and producing wells as of December 31, 2018, and average daily production presented on a three-stream basis for the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on estimates in the report prepared by Ryder Scott, we operated wells that represent 99.7% of the economic value of our proved developed oil, NGL and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018.

(1) | See "—Our operations—Estimated proved reserves" for discussion of the prices utilized to estimate our reserves.

Our net average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 68,168 BOE/D, 41% of which was oil, 29% of which was NGL and 30% of which was natural gas.
During 2015, commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend accelerated further into 2016, with crude oil prices reaching their lowest level in February 2016 since 2003. In the second half of 2016 and through 2017, commodity prices increased and stabilized at relatively higher prices but at significantly lower levels than the first half of 2014. In 2018, commodity prices continued to remain volatile with significantly lower prices in the last quarter of the year. Our capital expenditures budget for 2019 is approximately $365 million, based on annual benchmark averages of a $53.60 per barrel WTI NYMEX strip price and a $2.90 per MMBtu Henry Hub NYMEX strip price, excluding non-budgeted acquisitions. Our goal is to achieve cash flow neutrality, and therefore, our capital spending in 2019 will ultimately be influenced by commodity price changes, as well as any changes in service costs and drilling and completions efficiencies.
Beginning in 2016, we deliberately and significantly reduced the portion of our reserves that had historically been categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD." We adjusted our five-year SEC PUD bookings methodology because we believe it enables us to develop our acreage in the most efficient manner possible and determine which potential locations will be most profitable. We believe that we can optimize value for our shareholders by maintaining greater flexibility in choosing the specific drilling locations that will most efficiently develop our properties, particularly as technology changes and we continue to further understand the geology of our acreage. 
As our activities to date have indicated, the majority of our acreage represents a resource play. In the near-term, our goal is to drill those locations that we anticipate have the greatest potential to enhance shareholder value. We have determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this is to maintain the flexibility to choose those locations based upon insight gained as we drill and collect data across our acreage, regardless of SEC reserves-booking status. We converted all 26 PUD locations we booked at December 31, 2017 into proved producing locations in 2018. Reducing our future PUD commitments provides us the most flexibility to maximize our rate of return at prevailing conditions and minimize the requirement to drill wells previously assigned, under very different circumstances, as specific PUD locations. Accordingly, for 2019, we have continued to limit our booked PUD locations to those locations that we have a high degree of certainty that we will develop and have made a specific capital commitment to drill within the first six months of 2019. This strategy maintains our flexibility to add new PUD locations and convert other locations to proved developed reserves as we deem appropriate and opportunistic. See "—Proved undeveloped reserves" for additional information on our PUD reserves. 
Capitalizing on our large contiguous acreage blocks, we have built crude oil, natural gas and/or water systems in five production corridors on our Permian-Garden City acreage. These production corridors are designed to provide a combination of services which may include high-pressure centralized natural gas lift systems, crude oil and natural gas gathering and water delivery and takeaway capacity, with certain corridors also capable of accessing recycling facilities. We have built and maintain 60 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines to connect Laredo-operated wells in our Permian-Garden City acreage, providing a safer and more economic transportation alternative than trucking. We have also installed and maintain 159 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines across our Permian-Garden City acreage, providing us with takeaway optionality that enables us to maintain lower operating pressures and more consistent well performance. Our crude oil and natural gas gathering assets provided transportation for 55% of our production in 2018. Combined, our three water recycling facilities provide a recycling capacity of more than 54,000 Bbls of water per day, and a storage capacity of more than 3.6 million Bbls. Having these production corridors and associated facilities and infrastructure already in place is expected to enhance the value of our 2019 drilling program. 
Our midstream and marketing activities continue to focus on achieving increased efficiencies and cost reductions for (i) the transportation and marketing of our oil and natural gas (through the utilization of our oil and natural gas gathering 
10

systems to provide access to multiple markets and reduce the potential for production shut-ins caused by downstream capacity issues) and (ii) the handling of fresh, recycled and produced water (through the use of our water recycling facilities). 
We market the majority of production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in our operated properties. We sell substantially all of our production under contracts ranging from one month to several years, all at fluctuating market prices. We normally sell production to a relatively limited number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business; however, we believe that our customer diversification affords us optionality in our sales destination. We have committed a portion of our Permian crude oil production under firm transportation agreements, including with Medallion Gathering & Processing, LLC, a Texas limited liability company formed on October 12, 2012, which, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Medallion"), was established for the purpose of developing midstream solutions and providing midstream infrastructure to bring oil to market in the Midland Basin. This commitment will enhance our ability to move our crude oil out of the Permian Basin and give us access to potentially more favorable U.S. Gulf Coast pricing. See Note 4.c to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a further discussion of our firm transportation agreement with Medallion.
On October 30, 2017, LMS, together with Medallion Midstream Holdings, LLC ("MMH"), which was owned and controlled by an affiliate of The Energy & Minerals Group ("EMG"), completed the sale of 100% of the ownership interests in Medallion to an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners ("GIP"), for cash consideration of $1.825 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments (the "Medallion Sale"). LMS' net cash proceeds for its 49% ownership interest in Medallion in 2017 were $829.6 million, before post-closing adjustments and taxes, but after deduction of its proportionate share of fees and other expenses associated with the Medallion Sale. On February 1, 2018, closing adjustments were finalized and LMS received additional net cash of $1.7 million, for total net cash proceeds before taxes of $831.3 million. The proceeds were used to pay in-full borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, to redeem our May 2022 Notes (as defined below) and for working capital purposes. The Medallion Sale closed pursuant to the membership interest purchase and sale agreement, which provides for potential post-closing additional cash consideration that is structured based on GIP's realized profit at exit. There can be no assurance as to when and whether the additional consideration will be paid.
As of December 31, 2018, we were committed to deliver for sale or transportation the following fixed quantities of production under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity:

We have firm field transportation agreements that enable us or the purchasers of our oil production to move oil from our production area to major market hubs, including Colorado City, Texas, Midland, Texas and Crane, Texas. One of these agreements is with Medallion and it remains in place and unchanged following the Medallion Sale. Effective as of June 1, 2017, we signed a Dedication and Connection Agreement with Medallion whereby we dedicated to Medallion for transportation the oil from a significant portion of our acreage, subject to certain exceptions. We also have a firm transportation agreement to move oil from Colorado City, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. In 2018, we signed an agreement with Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC to initially transport 25,000 barrels of oil per day going to 35,000 barrels of oil per day of our production from Crane, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our shipments under this contract will begin when the pipeline commences operations which is anticipated in the second half of 2019.
Our production has been substantially equivalent to or greater than our delivery commitments during the three most recent years, and we expect such production to meet our 2019 commitments. We are subject to firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity and other contractual penalties. In certain instances, we have used spot market purchases to meet commitments in certain locations or due to favorable pricing. We anticipate continuing this practice in the future. We incurred 
11

firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity and other contractual penalties of $4.7 million, $1.1 million and $2.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also, if our production is not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments, we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments.
In the current market environment, we believe that we could sell our production to numerous companies, so that the loss of any one of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations solely by reason of such loss. For information regarding each of our customers that accounted for the purchase of 10% or more of our oil, NGL and natural gas revenues during the last three calendar years, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results."
We have built an extensive proprietary technical database on our properties, including (but not limited to) 1,133 square miles of 3D seismic, 70 wells with microseismic, 7,073 feet of whole core in 18 wells, 958 sidewall cores in 24 wells, over 1,300 open and cased-hole logging suites with over 130 dipole sonic logs, 23 single-zone tests and 40 production logs. Our strategic interest in utilizing this database is directed at characterizing subsurface reservoir properties to gain insight into principles that potentially govern resource recovery, which can be subsequently leveraged during development planning, with the goal of maximizing the value of our entire asset base. Our reservoir characterization process encompasses four fundamental areas: (i) high-resolution geocellular modeling, (ii) well spacing and completions optimization, (iii) reservoir engineering studies and (iv) predictive analytics. 
HRGM’s integrate the above-described data with enhanced interpretations conducted in 2018 to provide 3D reservoir and mechanical property models across the majority of Laredo’s acreage. HRGM’s provide a sufficiently high resolution and accurate depiction of subsurface development potential to continue executing the "drill to plan" technical workflow, implemented in 2017. Drill to plan targets geological landing points in the perceived highest quality reservoir. This minimizes target changes during operations, increasing the accuracy of well positioning, while reducing time and costs associated with target changes and enhancing operational efficiencies. All of the 2019 planned wells are anticipated to utilize drill to plan. 
HRGM’s provide the foundation for hydraulic fracture modeling, where hydraulic fracture and proppant transport models have been utilized to explicitly describe fracture networks. These fracture networks have then been used in conjunction with reservoir simulators to match specific packages of wells with unique landing points and completion designs. These models are then used to assess possible differences in fracture geometry and well productivity due to a multitude of variables, which include, but are not limited to, the landing point, well path, proppant loading, fluid loading, proppant concentration, pump rate and perforation design. Additionally, these models can be used for simulation of multi-well packages to assess potential interactions during the completion operation and total recovery factor of the resource in place.
Microseismic analysis continues to advance knowledge across various well spacing combinations and individual completion design field trials, improving our understanding of fracture geometry, cluster efficiency and proppant distribution associated with both well spacing and individual completion design. We consider our database and workflows advantageous in yielding important insights into subsurface behavior and consequently improved development decision making.
Predictive analytical modeling includes non-linear multivariate regression and machine learning algorithms facilitating the detection and assessment of the impact of individual parameters on fundamental value drivers. Proprietary software and workflows quantify the effects of individual parameters within completion designs, well spacing and rock properties on production. This knowledge can be leveraged to generate optimized, capital-efficient development plans.
We consider the above technical workflows to be potentially significant tools in optimizing multi-well developments. We anticipate that all of our horizontal wells to be drilled in 2019 will utilize at least some aspects of the above workflows. If our preliminary applications of these workflows are replicated in forward-looking well planning, we anticipate this will positively impact our ability to select optimal multi-well development plans.
Corporate history and structure
Laredo Petroleum, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in 2011 for the purpose of merging with Laredo Petroleum, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company formed in 2007) to consummate an IPO in December 2011. Laredo Petroleum, Inc. was the survivor of such merger and currently has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, LMS and GCM. As of December 31, 2018, affiliates of Warburg Pincus LLC ("Warburg Pincus"), our founding member, owned 21.9% of our common stock.

Debt 
Laredo Petroleum, Inc. is the borrower under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"), as well as the issuer of our $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6 1/4% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the "March 2023 Notes") and our $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5 5/8% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "January 2022 Notes"). We refer to the March 2023 Notes and the January 2022 Notes collectively as the "Senior Unsecured Notes." Our subsidiaries, LMS and GCM, are guarantors of the obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes. The maturity date of our Senior Secured Credit Facility is April 19, 2023, provided that if either the January 2022 Notes or March 2023 Notes have not been refinanced on or prior to the date (as applicable, the "Early Maturity Date") that is 90 days before their respective stated maturity dates, the Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on such Early Maturity Date.
On November 29, 2017 (the "May 2022 Notes Redemption Date"), following the Medallion Sale, we redeemed the entire $500.0 million outstanding principal amount of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "May 2022 Notes") at a redemption price of 103.688% of the principal amount of the May 2022 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the May 2022 Notes Redemption Date.
Our business strategy 
Our goal is to enhance shareholder value by executing the following strategy:
Maximize our capital efficiency by seeking to drill high rate of return wells through wider well spacing, reduced overhead and operational improvements 

• | In 2019, we will seek to reduce overhead costs while increasing operational efficiency and in the later part of the second quarter of 2019, we will widen the spacing between our wells in order to target high rate of return well results.


• | In order to increase our operational flexibility, in the past three years, we deliberately reduced our PUD bookings within our reserves. While this decision impacts our total booked reserves in the short term, we believe that it enhances our ability to drill our most efficient wells by providing us with crucial flexibility in tailoring our drilling plans in a manner that is more cost-efficient. We converted all 26 PUD locations we booked at December 31, 2017 into proved producing locations in 2018.

Deploy our capital in a strategic manner while considering value-enhancing acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, redemptions, repurchases, delevering and similar transactions

• | We will be highly selective in the projects that we consider and we will continue to monitor the market for strategic opportunities that we believe could be accretive and enhance shareholder value. These opportunities may take the form of acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, redemptions, repurchases, delevering or other similar transactions, any of which could result in the utilization of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and accessing the capital markets.

Proactively manage risk to limit downside

• | We actively attempt to limit our business and operating risks by focusing on safety, flexibility in our financial profile, operational efficiencies, hedging, controlling costs and developing oil and natural gas takeaway capacity with multiple delivery points.

Seek accretive acquisitions

• | As we continue to develop our existing Permian-Garden City acreage position, we believe that the acquisition of additional acreage may be beneficial as consolidation and increased scale may lead to increased operational and corporate efficiencies.

Continue to hedge our production to protect cash flows, diminish the effects of commodity price fluctuations and maintain upside exposure 

• | During 2018, our hedging program provided us with cash flow certainty. In the future, we will continue to seek hedging opportunities on a multi-year basis to further protect our cash flows from commodity price fluctuations while maintaining upside exposure if commodity prices increase.

Increase the use of our previously built infrastructure and evaluate opportunities for strategic expansion

• | We believe that our infrastructure provides us with optionality and efficiencies in developing and transporting production from our Permian-Garden City acreage position, as well as providing water transportation and recycling

services for a significant portion of our planned drilling activities. Because of the value we ascribe to this infrastructure, we will continue to look for strategic expansion opportunities while maintaining our core strategy of providing marketing optionality for our oil, NGL and natural gas production. 
Our competitive strengths 
We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will assist in the successful execution of our business strategy:
Contiguous acreage position with high working interests and extensive interests in leases held by production containing multiple formations, resulting in a substantial drilling inventory

• | We have 120,617 net acres in the Permian-Garden City area that are largely contiguous with a high average working interest percentage (average working interest of 97% in all Laredo-operated producing wells), are 88% held by production and have identified up to seven targets to date from which we can produce, resulting in a long-term drilling inventory. Our contiguous acreage position also enables us to drill long laterals (10,000 feet or greater) in many locations, which may provide an even greater rate of return as we continue to refine our spacing, drilling and completions techniques.

Drilling and lease operating efficiencies afforded by our acreage position and production corridors that enable low-cost operations

• | By making upfront investments in production infrastructure on our contiguous acreage position, we are now able to drill and operate in a more efficient and low-cost manner. We believe that this infrastructure will enable us to continue to be a low-cost operator while at the same time drilling facilitates productive new wells.

Significant cash flow from existing operations

• | Our Permian-Garden City acreage currently has approximately 1,155 net producing wells. That current base provides us with a significant amount of cash flow and such wells require little additional capital to maintain. In addition, we have few on-going drilling requirements to keep our Permian-Garden City acreage from lease expirations which further strengthens our flexibility to use cash flow from operations in a manner we see as most efficient.

Significant operational control

• | We operated wells that represent 99.7% of the economic value of our proved developed oil, NGL and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018, based on our reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. We believe that maintaining operating control permits us to better pursue our strategy of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and maximizing cost-efficient ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries through reservoir analysis and evaluation and continuous improvement of drilling, completions and stimulation techniques. We expect to maintain operating control over nearly all of our potential drilling locations.

Our production corridors and water recycle facilities enable us to more efficiently develop our acreage and utilize/dispose of water that facilitates development and reduces our capital and operating expenses

• | We believe that our previously built production corridors increase field level operating efficiencies in oil and natural gas gathering and takeaway capacity, water supply and operations. We have demonstrated that our production corridors provide us with identified areas within which we can achieve material cost savings and efficiencies through the use of our previously built infrastructure, including water recycling. In addition, drilling wells within these corridors increases our production consistency through increased knowledge thus enabling us to better plan our development program.


• | The use and disposal of water is one of the most challenging aspects of horizontal drilling in the Permian Basin and our production corridors provide us with a reliable and consistent means to ensure that we have the water we need to complete our wells while also providing low-cost takeaway capacity for flowback and produced water.

Extensive infrastructure in place

• | We own and operate more than 238 miles of pipeline in our crude oil and natural gas gathering, fuel gas and gas lift systems in the Permian Basin as of December 31, 2018. These systems and pipelines provide greater operational efficiency, capital and cost savings and potentially better pricing for our production and enable us to coordinate our activities to connect our wells to market upon completion with minimal pipeline delays.

Strong corporate governance and institutional investor support

• | Our board of directors is well qualified and represents a meaningful resource to our management team. Our board of directors, which is comprised of representatives of Warburg Pincus, other independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer, has extensive oil and natural gas industry and general business expertise. We actively engage our board of directors, on a regular basis, for their expertise on strategic, financial, governance and risk management activities. In addition, Warburg Pincus has many years of relevant experience in financing and supporting exploration and production companies and management teams. Warburg Pincus has been the lead investor in many such companies, including two previous companies operated by certain members of our management team.

Our extensive Permian technical database

• | We have made a substantial upfront investment in technical data in order to accurately assess reservoir and production characteristics of our largely contiguous acreage. Our extensive proprietary technical data set, in combination with industry-leading technologies and in-house workflows, enables a comprehensive characterization and visualization of the total subsurface resource potential. This, in turn, facilitates a development planning workflow that seeks to maximize resource recovery and achieve an attractive return on capital employed with respect to each discrete development package of wells.

Other properties
In addition to our Permian-Garden City acreage, as of December 31, 2018, we held 170 net acres in the Palo Duro Basin. Essentially all of this acreage will expire in 2019, absent drilling or renegotiation of the applicable leases. We anticipate little or no activity on these properties in 2019.
Our operations
Estimated proved reserves 
Our reserves are reported in three streams: crude oil, NGL and natural gas. In this Annual Report, the information with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared by Ryder Scott, in accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations.
SEC guidelines require companies to use the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period before differentials ("Benchmark Prices"). The Benchmark Prices are then adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead ("Realized Prices"). The Realized Prices are utilized to calculate estimated reserves and the associated discounted future cash flows. The following table presents the Benchmark Prices and Realized Prices as of the dates presented:

Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 assume our ability to fund the capital costs necessary for their development and are affected by pricing assumptions. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. Negative revisions to reserve estimates, decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices or increases in service costs, may lead to decreased earnings and increased losses or impairment of oil and natural gas properties."
The following table sets forth additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Ryder Scott estimated 100% of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The reserve estimates as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were prepared in accordance with the applicable SEC rules regarding oil, NGL and natural gas reserves reporting.

Technology used to establish proved reserves 
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible within five years from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term "reasonable certainty" implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, NGL and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
16

To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, open-hole logs, core analyses, geologic maps, available downhole and production data and seismic data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves, including individual b-factors, material balance calculations or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated primarily by performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and the use of geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation, well spacing and completion using similar techniques.
During 2015, commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend accelerated further into 2016, with crude oil prices reaching their lowest level in February 2016 since 2003. In the second half of 2016 and through 2017, commodity prices increased and stabilized at relatively higher prices but at significantly lower levels than the first half of 2014. In 2018, commodity prices continued to remain volatile with significantly lower prices in the last quarter of the year. Our capital expenditures budget for 2019 is approximately $365 million, based on annual benchmark averages of a $53.60 per barrel WTI NYMEX strip price and a $2.90 per MMBtu Henry Hub NYMEX strip price, excluding non-budgeted acquisitions. Our goal is to achieve cash flow neutrality, and therefore, our capital spending in 2019 will ultimately be influenced by commodity price changes, as well as any changes in service costs and drilling and completions efficiencies.
Beginning in 2016, we purposely significantly reduced the portion of our reserves that have historically been categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD." We adjusted our five-year SEC PUD bookings methodology because we believe it enables us to develop our acreage in the most efficient manner possible and determine which potential locations best enhance our overall value. We believe that we can optimize value for our shareholders by maintaining greater flexibility in choosing the specific drilling locations that will most efficiently develop our properties, particularly as technology changes and we continue to further understand the geology of our acreage. 
As our activities to date have indicated, the majority of our acreage represents a resource play. In the near term, our goal is to drill those locations that we anticipate have the potential to provide the greatest shareholder value. We have determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this is to maintain the flexibility to choose those locations based upon our continuing insight as we drill and collect data across our acreage, regardless of SEC reserves booking status. We converted all 26 PUD locations booked at December 31, 2017 into proved producing locations in 2018. Reducing our future PUD commitments provides us the most flexibility to maximize our rate of return at prevailing conditions and minimize the requirement to drill wells previously assigned, under very different circumstances, as specific PUD locations. Accordingly, for 2019, we have continued to limit our booked PUD locations to those we have a high degree of certainty to believe that we will develop and have made a specific capital commitment to drill within the first six months of 2019. This strategy maintains our flexibility to add new PUD locations and convert other locations to proved developed reserves as our plans deem appropriate and opportunistic.
Qualifications of technical persons and internal controls over reserves estimation process
In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE Reserves Auditing Standards") and guidelines established by the SEC, Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, estimated 100% of our proved reserve information as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 included in this Annual Report. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team meets regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott's preparation of the year-end reserve estimates. The Ryder Scott reserve report is reviewed with representatives of Ryder Scott and our internal technical staff before dissemination of the information. 
Our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He has more than 19 years of practical experience, with 10 years of this experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He has a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering from Rice University, a Masters of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management and a Masters of Engineering Management from Northwestern University. Our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering reports to our Senior Vice President - Midstream, 
17

Marketing & Subsurface. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior engineering staff, other members of senior management and our technical staff, our audit committee and our Chief Executive Officer. 
Proved undeveloped reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves decreased from 24,574 MBOE as of December 31, 2017 to 21,062 MBOE as of December 31, 2018. We estimate that we incurred $215.1 million of costs to convert 24,574 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from 26 locations into proved developed reserves in 2018. New proved undeveloped reserves of 18,452 MBOE were added during the year from 18 new horizontal Wolfcamp locations. Positive revisions to proved undeveloped reserves of 2,610 MBOE were due to adding two undeveloped locations that were removed from reserves in a previous year. A final investment decision has been made on these 20 locations and they are scheduled to be drilled and completed in 2019. 
Estimated total future development and abandonment costs related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves as shown in our December 31, 2018 reserve report are $159.0 million. Based on this report and our PUD booking methodology, the capital estimated to be spent in 2019 to develop the proved undeveloped reserves is $155.0 million and $0 for each of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Based on our anticipated cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the availability of capital markets transactions, all of the proved undeveloped locations are expected to be drilled within the first six months of 2019. Reserve calculations at any end-of-year period are representative of our development plans at that time. Changes in circumstance, including commodity pricing, oilfield service costs, technology, acreage position and availability and other economic and regulatory factors may lead to changes in development plans.

Title to properties
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under oil and gas leases or net profit interests.
Oil and natural gas leases 
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGL and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 87.5%. As of December 31, 2018, 88% of our Permian-Garden City acreage was HBP.
Seasonality
Demand for oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with a wide range of companies in our industry, including those that have greater resources than we do and those that are smaller with fewer ongoing obligations. Many of the larger companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also conduct refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Many of the smaller companies have a lower cost structure and more liquidity. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory locations or evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater resources to attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration and production activities during periods of low market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because of the inherent advantages of some of our competitors, those companies may have an advantage in bidding for exploratory and producing properties.
Hydraulic fracturing 
We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process for our producing properties in Texas because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. We are currently conducting hydraulic fracturing activity in the completion of our wells in the Permian Basin. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain any of our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will be required in the future to develop the proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. Nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling, recompletion and refracture stimulation projects require hydraulic fracturing.
We have and continue to follow standard industry practices and applicable legal requirements. State and federal regulators impose requirements on our operations designed to ensure protection of human health and the environment. These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water formations and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This well design is intended to eliminate a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval.
Injection rates and pressures are monitored instantaneously and in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations would be shut down immediately if an abrupt change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure.
Certain state regulations require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Approximately 99% of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. In accordance with Texas regulations, we report the constituents of the hydraulic fracturing fluids utilized in our well completions on FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org). Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it by recycling or by discharging into the approved disposal wells. We currently do not discharge water to the surface. Based upon results of testing the performance of recycled flowback/produced water in our fracing operations, we have constructed and currently operate three water recycle facilities on our production corridors providing a recycling capacity of more than 54,000 Bbls of water per day, and a storage capacity of more than 3.6 million Bbls. 
For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please read "-Regulation of environmental and occupational health and safety matters-Hydraulic fracturing." For related risks to our stockholders, please read "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells could prohibit projects or result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays because of the significance of hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells in our business."
Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The State of Texas has regulations governing environmental and conservation matters, including provisions for the pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the permitting of allocation wells, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells (including the proration of production to the market demand for oil, NGL and natural gas), the regulation of well spacing, the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas within its jurisdiction. Texas further regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the natural gas industry are regularly considered by the current administration, Congress, 
the states, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered, and such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impacts of compliance.
Regulation of environmental and occupational health and safety matters 
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures, the noncompliance with which carries substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations to remediate noncompliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, completion and production process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. 
Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of "fault" is required) that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several. Public interest in the protection of the environment has tended to increase over time. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements, our business and prospects, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general, could be materially adversely affected.
Hazardous substance and waste handling
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed "responsible parties." These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Despite the "petroleum exclusion" of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. Finally, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA") is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under 
the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on "responsible parties" for all containment and clean-up costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. 
We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. Although RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is also possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes." Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA and related state and local laws and regulations, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although we believe that the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
Water and other waste discharges and spills
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), the OPA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps"). On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. The rules are subject to ongoing litigation and have been stayed in more than half the States, including Texas. Also, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps released a proposed rule that would replace the 2015 rule, and significantly reduce the waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. The proposal is currently subject to public review and comment, after which additional legal challenges are anticipated. As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. To the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 
The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. The State of Texas also maintains groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. 
These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as "SPCC plans," in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms.
Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (the "UIC"). However, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC, and thus the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program permitting guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how Class II regulations may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of this permit guidance. Furthermore, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption from the SDWA, provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. 
In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. We cannot predict the impact that these actions may have on our business at this time, but further regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Also, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the rule, and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule; however, a coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the State of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the hydraulic fracturing rule will be implemented, and what impact it would have on our operations.
Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism.
Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, beginning February 1, 2012, companies were required to disclose to the RRC and the public the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used. Also, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal 
wells. In addition to state law, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These developments, as well as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law.
Air emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Also, on May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
In August 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). The rules include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds ("VOC") emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of these requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation's energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. Also, on October 15, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule to significantly reduce regulatory burdens imposed by the 2016 regulations, including, for example, reducing the monitoring frequency for fugitive emissions and revising the requirements for pneumatic pumps at well sites.
In addition, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a waste prevention rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rule and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. On April 4, 2018, a federal district court stayed certain provisions of the rule pending the BLM’s reconsideration and, on September 28, 2018, the BLM finalized revisions to the waste prevention rule to reduce “unnecessary compliance burdens.” The States of California and New Mexico have challenged the scaled-back rule. At this time, it is uncertain when, and to what extent, the waste prevention rule will be implemented, and what impact it will have on our operations.
These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions.
We have incurred additional capital expenditures to insure compliance with these new regulations as they come into effect. We may also be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing other air emission related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations.
Regulation of "greenhouse gas" emissions
In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"). The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce GHG emissions primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Also, some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.
At the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord. 
Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.
National Environmental Policy Act
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. Any exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands would require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or its habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, though, in December 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") provided guidance limiting the reach of the Act. The USFWS may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could adversely impact the value of our leases.
Summary
In summary, we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Regulation of oil and gas pipelines 
Our oil and gas pipelines are subject to construction, installation, operation and safety regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") and various other federal, state and local agencies. Congress has enacted several pipeline safety acts over the years. Currently, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") under DOT administers pipeline safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. These regulations, among other things, address pipeline integrity management and pipeline operator qualification rules. In June 2016, Congress approved new pipeline safety legislation, the "Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016" (the "PIPES Act"), which provides the PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. Significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the current pipeline control system capabilities.
Recently, the PHMSA has proposed additional regulations for gas pipeline safety. For example, in March 2016, the PHMSA proposed a rule that would expand integrity management requirements beyond "High Consequence Areas" to apply to gas pipelines in newly defined "Moderate Consequence Areas." The public comment period closed on July 7, 2016. Also, on January 10, 2017, the PHMSA approved final rules expanding its safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines by, among other things, expanding the required use of leak detection systems, requiring more frequent testing for corrosion and other flaws and requiring companies to inspect pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather or natural disasters. The final rule was withdrawn by the PHMSA in January 2017, and it is unclear whether and to what extent the PHMSA will move forward with its regulatory reforms.
Disclosures required pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) knowingly engaged in certain specified activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities targeted by United States' economic sanctions during the period covered by the report. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Neither we nor any of our controlled affiliates or subsidiaries knowingly engaged in any of the specified activities relating to Iran or otherwise engaged in any activities associated with Iran during the reporting period. However, because the SEC defines the term "affiliate" broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controlled us or is under common control with us.
The description of the activities below has been provided to us by Warburg Pincus, affiliates of which: (i) beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock and are members of our board of directors and (ii) beneficially own more than 10% of the outstanding common stock of and are members of the board of directors of Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "EIGI"). EIGI may therefore be deemed to be under "common control" with us; however, this statement is not meant to be an admission that common control exists.
The disclosure below relates solely to activities conducted by EIGI. The disclosure does not relate to any activities conducted by Laredo or by Warburg Pincus and does not involve our or Warburg Pincus' management. Neither Laredo nor 
Warburg Pincus had any involvement in or control over the disclosed activities of EIGI, and neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus has independently verified or participated in the preparation of the disclosure. Neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus is representing as to the accuracy or completeness of the disclosure nor do we or Warburg Pincus undertake any obligation to correct or update it.
Laredo understands that EIGI intends to disclose in its next annual or quarterly SEC report that:
"On July 25, 2018, the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") designated Electronics Katrangi Trading ("Katrangi") as a Specially Designated National ("SDN") pursuant to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 544. On July 30, 2018, during a regular compliance scan of EIGI's user base, EIGI identified the domain SGP-FRANCE.COM (the "Domain Name") which was listed as a website associated with Katrangi, on one of EIGI's platforms. The Domain Name was managed using one of EIGI's platforms by one of its reseller customers. Accordingly, there was no direct financial transaction between EIGI and the registered owner of the Domain Name and EIGI did not generate any revenue in connection with the Domain Name since Katrangi was added to the SDN list on July 25, 2018. Upon discovering the Domain Name on its platform, EIGI promptly suspended the Domain Name and removed it from its platform. EIGI reported the Domain Name to OFAC on August 7, 2018.
On November 6, 2018, EIGI terminated an end customer account (the "End Customer Account") that EIGI believed to be associated with Arian Bank, which was identified by OFAC as an SDN on November 5, 2018, pursuant to 31 C.F.R. Part 594. EIGI initially acquired the End Customer Account on January 23, 2014 as part of EIGI's acquisition of P.D.R Solutions FZC. EIGI reported the End Customer Account to OFAC as potentially the property of an SDN subject to blocking pursuant to Executive Order 13224. As of February 1, 2019, EIGI had not received any correspondence from OFAC regarding this matter."
