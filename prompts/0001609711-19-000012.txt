Item 1. Business
Our customers have bold aspirations—the drive to be their own boss, write their own story and take a leap of faith to pursue their dreams. Launching that salon, opening that gym, organizing that community event, starting their blog, or whatever sparks their passion. We are inspired by our customers, and are dedicated to helping them turn their powerful ideas into meaningful action. Our vision is to radically shift the global economy toward life-fulfilling independent ventures.
Overview
Our 18.5 million customers are everyday entrepreneurs with vibrant ideas. They are risk-takers with passion and grit, determined to make their way in the world and to transform their ideas into something meaningful. Our customers have many roles; they have to simultaneously run marketing, accounting, and service delivery operations. Time is their most valuable resource; they want an online presence that makes an impact, but may not have the time and skills to make that happen. Our goal is to be a trusted partner to our customers, bringing together the technology, ease of use and care necessary to bring their ideas to life online.
We are a leading technology provider to small businesses, web design professionals and individuals, delivering simple, easy-to-use cloud-based products and outcome-driven, personalized Customer Care. Our products enable our customers to transform their ideas into reality through their website, email and social presence. This often starts with the most intimate of brand considerations - their domain name - and expands through our website building, hosting, social, security, productivity and do-it-for-you offerings. As our customers grow, we provide applications and access to relevant third-party products and platforms helping them connect to their customers, manage and grow their businesses and get found online.
What it means to be online has evolved from a static website to a responsive website integrated with social channels, search engines, reputation platforms and e-commerce marketplaces. This creates the need to syndicate dynamic information across all the places our customers engage with their audience, including things like appointment availability, retail inventory, digital subscriptions, and social media presence, among many other things. 
At GoDaddy, we believe our customers should have both great technology and great customer support. We believe engaging with our customers in a proactive, consultative way helps them knock down the technology hurdles they face. Through the thousands of conversations we have with our customers every day, we receive valuable feedback enabling us to continually evolve our products and solutions and respond to their changing needs.
Our people and unique culture have been integral to our success. We live by the same principles that enable our customers' ideas to survive and thrive: hard work, perseverance, conviction, an obsession with customer satisfaction and a belief that no one can do it better. We take responsibility for driving successful outcomes and are accountable to our customers, which we believe has been a key factor in enabling our rapid customer and revenue growth. We believe we have one of the most recognized technology brands in the U.S. and our international awareness continues to rapidly increase as we've entered into new markets.

Our Market
Our customers represent a large and diverse market which we believe is largely underserved. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there were approximately 30.8 million small businesses in 2016. Based on data from the 2016 U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Small Business Administration, over 90% of small businesses have fewer than five employees and approximately 25 million, or over 76%, of small businesses were non-employer firms. Furthermore, the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity Report estimated that in 2017 there were approximately 540,000 new business owners created each month in the U.S. Moreover, according to a study performed by the International Finance Corporation and McKinsey Company, there are more than 500 million micro, small and medium enterprises (defined as one to 250 employees) worldwide. We believe our addressable market extends beyond small businesses and includes individuals and organizations, such as universities, community organizations, charities and hobbyists.
Despite the ubiquity and importance of the Internet to individual consumers, most small businesses and organizations have remained offline given their limited resources and inadequate tools. However, as proliferation of mobile devices blurs the online/offline distinction into an "always online" world, having an impactful online presence is becoming a "must have" for small businesses worldwide.
What it means for small businesses, ventures and ideas to be online continues to evolve. Today, having an effective online presence often means having a combination of: (i) a secure and content rich website viewable from any device; (ii) presence on social media channels (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and WeChat), (iii) search engines and an increasing number of horizontal marketplaces (e.g. Yelp and Eventbrite), (iv) vertical marketplaces (e.g. OpenTable and HomeAdvisor); (v) branded email communication; (vi) online marketing; and (vii) Internet-enabled commerce ability with reservation and scheduling capabilities for service-based businesses and a product catalog and e-commerce capabilities for product-based businesses. In addition, other needs such as telephony, payment processing, and accounting and tax preparation, which had traditionally been separate point solutions, can now be part of an integrated solution.
Our Customers
Our customers share common traits, such as tenacity and determination. They have an entrepreneurial spirit, strong work ethic and, above all, passion for their ideas, yet their specific needs vary depending on the type and stage of their ideas. They range from individuals who have an idea and those thinking about starting a business as well as established ventures needing help attracting customers, growing their sales, managing their presence or expanding their operations. Most of our customers have fewer than five employees and most self-identify as having little to no technology or design skills. They need our help to create a unique and secure digital identity. While our customers have differing degrees of resources and technical capabilities, they all share a desire to find tools to help them bring their ideas to life, enhance connections with their audience and find new customers. 
Our Opportunity—What Successful Ideas Need
Our customers are consumers themselves and use the Internet to research and shop for solutions, which makes them keenly aware of the need to have an impactful online presence. While our customers' needs change depending on where they are in their journey, the most common customer needs we serve include:

• | Getting online and looking great. Our customers want to develop an online presence by finding a name that perfectly identifies their business, hobby or passion. They want to create a digital identity so their customers can find, engage and transact with them online. We believe a complete digital identity includes an elegant, mobile-enabled website and the ability to get found across various search engines, social media platforms and vertical marketplaces.

• | Growing their business and running their operations. Our customers need to communicate with their existing customers and find new ones. They also need easy-to-use products and tools to help run their businesses, including productivity, marketing, payment and security tools.


• | Connecting with a real person when they need help. Our customers sometimes need assistance to set up a website, launch a new feature or try something new. They need real people who are available 24/7/365 and in the manner that works best for them, whether by phone, by chat or in community forums.


• | Technology that grows with them and their customers. Our customers need a simple platform and set of tools enabling their domain, website and other solutions to easily work together as their idea grows and becomes more complex. The right platform can meet the needs of entrepreneurs who may not be technologically savvy, Web Pros with more complex requirements and customers with a range of needs in between.


• | Reliability, security and performance. Our customers expect reliable products and want to be confident their digital presence is secure. Our customers work on their ideas whenever and however they can and need solutions fitting their lifestyle and schedule.


• | Affordable solutions. Our customers often have limited financial resources and are unable to make large, upfront investments in the latest technology. Our customers need affordable solutions leveling the playing field and giving them the tools to look and act like bigger ventures.

Our Solution—What We Do and How We Do It 
We built GoDaddy to serve our customers by providing elegant, easy-to-use cloud-based products on a single technology platform wrapped with personalized Customer Care. Our customers turn to us to:

For more technically-sophisticated web designers, developers and customers, we provide high-performance, flexible hosting and security products that can be used with a variety of open source design tools. We design these solutions to be easy to use, effective, reliable, flexible and at a great value.


• | Add back-office and marketing products. Our customers want to spend their time on what matters most to them, selling their products or services or helping their customers do the same. We provide them with productivity tools such as domain-specific email, second-line telephony, online storage and payment solutions to help run their ventures. We also provide robust marketing products, such as social media management and email marketing, to help them attract and retain customers.

Our specialists are evaluated on customer outcomes and the quality of the experience they provide.


• | Receive high value. We price most of our products at a few dollars per month while providing our customers with robust features and functionality.

Our Strategy—How We Grow
We're focused on helping our customers with individualized solutions for each phase of their journey. We leverage our team's deep understanding of what our customers need to develop new products and provide empathetic and targeted customer care. We are pursuing the following principal strategies to drive our business:

• | Expand and innovate our product and service offerings to provide more comprehensive solutions for our customers and to offer more ways for new customers to find us. We are working both to grow our core product offerings and create innovative new products, including:


• | Delivering the next generation of naming. The first generation of naming included a limited set of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as .com and .net, and country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), such as .uk and .in. Hundreds of new gTLDs have been introduced in recent years, expanding the available inventory for us and our customers. Additionally, we have invested to expand the secondary market to help match buyers to sellers who already own domains. Our GoDaddy Investor mobile application helps investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of current bids from their mobile devices. We continue to invest in search, discovery and recommendation tools and transfer protocols for both primary and secondary domains.


• | Powering elegant and effortless presence. We offer a range of products and services that help our customers get their ideas online. GoCentral combines a mobile-optimized website builder with an integrated set of marketing and e-commerce tools to help our customers create an audience for their idea or business, enabling them to design a professional website in under an hour. We continue to invest in GoCentral and other tools, templates and technology to make building, maintaining and updating a professional looking mobile or desktop presence simple and easy. In 2018, we introduced social media management tools through our acquisition of Main Street Hub, which help our customers develop, maintain and own their social media brand and reputation as well as interact with their customers. Additionally, we are investing in products to help our customers drive their customer acquisition, retention and communication efforts by managing their presence across search engines, social networks and vertical marketplaces and keep their online presence and information secure.


• | Making the business of business easy. Our business applications range from domain-specific email and email marketing to telephony services and payment tools to help our customers communicate with their customers and grow their ideas. We intend to continue investing in the breadth of our product offerings to help our customers connect with their customers and run their ventures.


• | Go global. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 44% of our customers were located in international markets, notably Canada, India, United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia. We have made significant investments in the localization of our service offerings in markets outside of the U.S. and, as of December 31, 2018, we offered localized products and Customer Care in over 50 markets. To support our international growth, we will continue investing to develop our local capabilities across products, marketing programs, data centers and Customer Care. International acquisitions, including our acquisition of HEG, are an important part of this international growth.


• | Make it personal. We seek to leverage data and insights to personalize the product and Customer Care experiences of our customers as well as tailor our solutions and marketing efforts to each of our customer groups. We are constantly seeking to improve our website, marketing programs and Customer Care to intelligently reflect where customers are in their lifecycle and identify their specific product needs. This allows us to interact more frequently with our customers. We intend to continue investing in our technology and data platforms to further enable our personalization efforts.


• | Win the Web Pros. We are investing in a suite of applications and services for web designers and developers to help them save time, make money and exceed client expectations. These client management applications make it easier for designers and developers to manage their clients' websites at any host, host websites on GoDaddy products such as Managed WordPress, and manage their overall business with capabilities such as client billing. Services for Web Pros also include administrative access and shopping features which make it easier to buy and manage multiple products for their clients, as well as enhanced technical support and discounts for reselling GoDaddy products. We support a variety of control panels and content management tools favored by Web Pros including cPanel, Plesk, Drupal, Joomla and more. As one of the largest global hosts of WordPress sites, many of our recent investments have focused on extending our reach into the WordPress community.


• | Wrap it with Care. We believe our highly-rated Customer Care team is distinctive and essential to the lifetime value proposition we offer our customers. We continue to invest in our Customer Care team, including investing to expand our Customer Care service, improve the quality of our Customer Care resources and introduce enhanced tools and processes across our expanding global footprint.

9


• | Partner up. Our flexible platform also enables us to acquire companies and quickly launch new products for our customers, including through partnerships such as Microsoft Office 365 for email and PayPal and Square for payments. We have also acquired companies and technologies to complement our product and service offerings and expand our geographic footprint. We intend to continue identifying value-added technology acquisition targets and partnership opportunities.

Products
We have designed and developed an extensive set of easy-to-use cloud-based technology products enabling our customers to establish a digital presence, connect with their customers and manage their ventures. We understand our customers' needs vary depending on the type and stage of their idea, which is why we offer our products both independently and bundled as suites of integrated products designed for specific activities.
Our domain name registration products enable us to engage customers at the initial stage of establishing a digital identity and often is an on-ramp for our other products. We believe our hosting and presence and business applications products increase our revenue and margin growth opportunities, frequently serve as starting points for our customer relationships, improve customer retention and significantly improve our value proposition to customers.
Domains
We are the global market leader in domain name registration. Securing a domain is a key component to creating a complete digital identity and our domain products often serve as the starting point in our customer relationships. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 92% of our customers had purchased a domain from us, and as of December 31, 2018, we had more than 77 million domains under management. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated approximately 46%, 47% and 50% of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our domain products.
Our primary domains product offerings are:
Primary Registrations. Using our website or mobile application, we offer customers the ability to search for and register available domain names with the relevant registry. Our inventory for primary registrations is defined by the number of top-level domains (TLDs) we offer. As of December 31, 2018, 404 different gTLDs (e.g. .com, .net and .org) and 50 different ccTLDs (e.g. .de, .ca, .in and .jp.) were available for purchase through GoDaddy. Since 2013, hundreds of new gTLDs have been launched, making it easier for companies and individuals to find and register new, easy-to-remember domain names tailored to their ideas, industry or interests. ccTLDs are important to our international expansion efforts as we have found international customers often prefer the ccTLD for the country or geographic market in which they operate. Our primary registration offering relies heavily on our search, discovery and recommendation tools which enable our customers to find a name matching their needs. We also sell domain registrations through relationships with third-party resellers.
Aftermarket. We operate one of the world's largest domain aftermarkets, which processes aftermarket, or secondary, domain name sales. Our aftermarket platform is designed to enable the seamless purchase and sale of an already registered domain name through an online auction, an offer and counter-offer transaction or a "buy now" transaction. Over the last four years, we have acquired more than 730,000 domain names to increase the inventory available to our customers. Our GoDaddy Investor mobile application helps investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of their current bids, all from their mobile devices. We operate a cross-registrar network that automates transaction execution across registrars thereby reducing the time required to complete a transaction. We receive a percentage of the sales price for each domain sold.
Domain Name Add-Ons. Domain name add-ons are features a customer can add to a domain name registration. Our domain name privacy product allows our customers to register a domain name on an "unlisted" basis helping prevent privacy intrusions, deter domain-related spam and allow our customers to confidentially secure a domain for an unannounced product, service or idea. Domain name add-ons are typically purchased concurrently with domain name registrations and have low costs associated with their delivery.

Hosting and Presence
We offer a variety of hosting and presence products enabling our customers to create and manage their digital identity, or in the case of Web Pros, the digital identities of their end-customers. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 38%, 38% and 37%, respectively, of our total revenue from sales of our hosting and presence products.
Our primary hosting products are:

We operate, maintain and support shared website hosting in our owned and operated data centers and our leased co-located data centers using either Linux or Windows operating systems. We currently offer several tiers of shared website hosting plans to suit the needs and resources of our customers, a majority of which use industry standard cPanel or Parallels Plesk control panels. We also bundle our hosting plans with a variety of applications and products such as web analytics, secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates and WordPress. WordPress is the most used content management application on our shared hosting platform.

We offer a variety of plans, with pricing dependent on business and marketing features. With each of these plans, customers have access to vertically targeted professional designs which can be further customized using our editor by adding intent-driven sections, photos, videos or text. Our designs cover a wide range of categories with professionally written content for small businesses, organizations, families, weddings, and other ideas. Our websites and our tools are all designed to work great on mobile devices, with a focus on performance, which is critical for websites to appear in search engine rankings.
Our GoCentral product includes online appointments and online store capabilities allowing customers to transact business directly on their websites, and is optimized for mobile shopping and secure checkout via credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Square, or PayPal. Our online store allows customers to manage inventory and shipping, while online appointments manages staff availability and helps remind customers of appointments. Both are integrated into our social and email marketing tools, to help customers generate more business.
Marketing. Our GoCentral product line includes a range of marketing tools and services designed to help businesses acquire and engage customers. These capabilities are available in an integrated offering with our website and commerce tools, or as a stand-alone for customers using other website content-management systems. The tools are designed for busy customers who may lack experience with online marketing, focusing on ease of use, mobile experience, and delivering business results. Search Engine Optimization helps our customers get their websites found on major search sites through search engine optimization using

a simple step-by-step wizard with targeted recommendations on which search phrases are most likely to drive traffic to a customer's site.

This service combines dedicated teams of branding experts – photographers, writers, designers, marketers – with proprietary technology to manage activity on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Yelp, among others, to help them acquire new customers and build stronger relationships with existing customers.
Business Applications
We offer a variety of products designed to make the business of business easier for our customers. The products we offer include those developed in-house as well as third-party applications which we distribute and support, such as Microsoft Office 365. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 16%, 15% and 13% of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our business applications products.
Our primary business applications products are:
Microsoft Office 365. We offer fully-supported Microsoft Office 365 accounts that are easy to set up and use with our customers' domains. We offer Microsoft Office 365 in multiple plans ranging from email with calendar and contacts connected to a custom domain to a full suite of productivity tools, including file sharing and full desktop versions of Microsoft productivity applications, including Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. For customers wanting to protect their email data, we offer an email backup service, and for customers needing to comply with regulatory requirements, we offer email add-on services such as HIPAA-enabled email, encryption services (in partnership with ProofPoint) and archiving services (in partnership with Barracuda). We help make Microsoft Office 365 installation easy, allowing customers to get up and running in minutes, including "do-it-for-me" migrations services to move customers' existing email data to Office 365 accounts.
Email Accounts. We offer a range of email service plans with a multi-feature web interface that connects to our customers' domains. The pricing of these plans depends on the customer's desired amount of storage and number of email addresses.

Email Marketing. Our email marketing product helps customers market their businesses through permission-based email. Customers can easily create and send newsletters, targeted advertising campaigns, promotions and surveys as well as connect email campaigns with their social media networks and track the results of campaigns.
Telephony. We provide internet-based telephone services that can be accessed with either IP phones, traditional local or cellular telephone services. In 2017, we launched our SmartLine plan, which includes a virtual number phone and mobile application, enabling customers to have two numbers on one phone to separate their business communications from personal communications. All of our plans allow customers to make and receive phone calls, send/receive text and MMS messages using their Smartline number and chosen caller ID.  In addition, Smartline offers customers a range of minutes and texts, a local or toll-free number and a mobile application to manage the service, as well as voicemail, voicemail transcription, email delivery of voicemail, customized business greetings, business hour settings and the ability to block unwanted callers. We also offer single and multi-line VoIP phone systems, IP-enabled phones, virtual phone numbers, virtual receptionist services, customizable phone tree, follow-me call forwarding and fax-on-demand.
Technology and Infrastructure
Our products, customer experiences and business systems are enabled by our technology and infrastructure, to ensure scalability, security and flexibility. Technology and development expenses, including those expenses related to our technology platform, were $434 million, $356 million and $288 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The growth in our technology and development expenses has been driven primarily by our focus on product development to provide software-driven product experiences such as our website building suite, security, social channel management, second-line telephony, email, domain aftermarket, and continued innovation in our domain registration and hosting offerings, among others. We have built a scalable infrastructure platform allowing us to optimize for economies of scale and enable next-generation hosting architecture for our customers, while investing in faster data centers, improved network connectivity and improved resiliency, both domestically and internationally.
12

Physical Infrastructure and Management
Our physical technology infrastructure supports our products, experiences, and business systems through servers located in data centers around the world. As the world’s largest manager of DNS traffic and a leading website hosting platform, we have invested significantly in our peering architecture and underlying infrastructure management to handle high IP transit traffic at low bandwidth costs. We have invested in the automation of common physical data center components like servers, load balancers, switches and storage and we use open source solutions when possible to automate manual processes and thereby reduce the risk of human error and lower costs. Additionally, we are beginning to use a single automated infrastructure based on OpenStack to enable next-generation services. In 2018 we announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as we begin to migrate our internal infrastructure into the cloud over the next 5-7 years, which will accelerate our ability to provide speed and reliability in both our product experiences and our customers’ hosting instances. These efforts and our large technology infrastructure footprint allow us to scale and provide our customers with valuable products at affordable prices.
Customer Experience and Business Systems
Our platform provides our customers fast, simple and customer-centric products across the globe, by allowing us to easily and quickly build and deploy new products incorporating our data insights. Our investments in our platform capabilities include the following:
E-commerce Platform and Application Services. While we continue to use our existing platform, we have developed and begun to implement a new e-commerce platform. We expect this new platform to enhance our value proposition to our customers by offering comprehensive, flexible and integrated solutions that can be rapidly scaled up or down, used across multiple platforms and integrated with third-party offerings. Both our existing and new platforms also allow resellers to easily sell our products, thereby broadening our distribution channels. We seek to continuously launch new and relevant applications and streamline our existing offerings in order to provide the best user experience to our customers.
Data Platform. Our horizontal data platform helps us to be a trusted source of data about our customers and their online ideas through accurate, meaningful, and easily consumable data insights, which allows us to build best-in-class, personalized experiences for our customers. Our data platform is key to helping us deepen our customer and business insights; these insights enable innovation through instrumentation, experimentation and analysis.
Content and Marketing Platform. Our content and marketing platforms leverage the latest tools, technology and operational and production models that enable us to deliver customer-centric digital experiences at an accelerated pace through multiple touchpoints and channels. Our content platform and content creation processes help us realize efficiencies and scalability, which enhance our ability to drive new, high quality products and customer experiences to market faster. We are focused on driving advancements in experimentation, the speed and volume of content creation, localization and content self-service, while ensuring platform availability and performance. We are also delivering new engagement marketing capabilities that improve business effectiveness and customer experiences.
Enterprise Operations. We implemented an enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform across our human capital management operations and expect to deploy it for our financial and procurement operations during 2019.
Product Development
We have invested heavily in our product development teams as we have expanded the ways we serve our customers to adjust to their changing needs from primarily domain name registration and hosting to a broader spectrum of offerings. Our primary website building products (GoCentral and Managed WordPress), security suite, email offerings (Microsoft Office 365, Workspaces, and Open X-change), social media management, second-line telephony (Smartline), and domain aftermarket each represent significant need states that are complementary to our long-standing offerings and benefit from our strengths as a company in human-infused technology. Our product development investments have grown at a significantly higher rate than our physical infrastructure and business system expenses, reflecting our expanding role in enabling our customers’ success with a powerful digital presence.

Customer Care
We have over 6,300 Customer Care specialists who provide technical assistance 24/7/365 to customers located around the world. Our specialists use a consultative approach to advise customers of products best suiting their individual needs. This ability to provide real-time product suggestions while providing a world-class support experience allows our Customer Care team to provide an impactful contribution to bookings through the sale of product subscriptions. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, at least 17% of our total bookings were generated from the sale of product subscriptions by our Customer Care team. Our latest merchandising strategies, such as free trials and an increased mix of monthly product subscriptions, drove more renewal billings to our website and away from the Customer Care team during 2018, which we expect to continue in the future. The majority of our Customer Care specialists are located in our Arizona and Iowa facilities in the U.S. We have additional international specialists providing in-region support in native languages. In addition, our easy-to-use website contains extensive educational content designed to demystify the process of establishing an online presence and to assist customers in choosing the products best meeting their needs. We also provide a variety of online tutorials through blogs and other services including The GoDaddy Garage Blog and third-party sites like YouTube.
Our Customer Care team operates through a variety of channels to provide tailored and timely support to our customers, handling approximately 18 million contacts in 2018. Our customers can choose their preferred Customer Care channel, including proactive and reactive chat and phone support. We take a consultative approach to our customer interactions, acting as a trusted partner to answer their questions, to guide them through technical solutions, to offer real-time product suggestions best suited to their needs and to support them at each phase of their lifecycle. The effectiveness of our model is reflected in the high ratings we receive from our customers, the bookings generated by our Customer Care team and strong customer referrals.
The strength of our Customer Care team is our people. Our hiring process is extensive and highly selective, designed to yield individuals who will thrive in our team based on core values, character, work ethic and ability. Our new Customer Care hires spend over a month moving from classroom to a live "nesting" environment where they refine their customer and technology skills. With a commitment to life-long learning, we offer extensive classes to our employees spanning leadership, sales, service and technology. Our incentive program rewards outcomes, across both customer satisfaction and bookings goals. For these and many other reasons, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 35% of our Customer Care specialists had been with us for at least three years.
Marketing
We believe GoDaddy is one of the most recognized technology brands in the U.S. with increased awareness globally. We have established this high level of brand awareness primarily through our advertising campaigns across various platforms including television commercials, print, online and billboards, and have supplemented these advertising campaigns with athlete and celebrity sponsorships. Our strong brand has helped us attract and retain 18.5 million customers as of December 31, 2018. We intend to continue investing in our brand as we seek to further grow our total customers, particularly internationally. Customer referrals are another highly efficient and cost-effective channel for acquiring customers.
We complement our brand marketing efforts with focused and metric-driven direct response marketing to acquire new customers. We use a variety of targeted online marketing programs for lead generation, including search engine marketing, search engine optimization and targeted email and social media marketing campaigns, as well as more traditional direct marketing and indirect channel partner marketing programs, to drive interest in our products and traffic to our websites. As part of this effort, we regularly run numerous campaigns simultaneously and constantly refine our media mix across our channels.
International
Central to our international strategy is a philosophy of localizing our product offerings and customer experience and deploying them through our global infrastructure. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 8 million customers outside of the U.S. and derived approximately 35%, 33% and 28% of our total bookings from international sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We have built a dedicated team responsible for the internationalization and localization of our core product offerings as well as our Customer Care and marketing efforts, including through our acquisition of HEG in 2017. In conjunction with our localization efforts, we added on-the-ground regional teams and increased our country and regional specific marketing spend. These investments have enabled us to successfully launch and expand our business outside the U.S. and as of December 31, 2018, we provided localized products and Customer Care in over 50 markets around the world. We have taken a rigorous approach to managing the level of investment we expect to make in each geographic market we enter based on a market tier approach. We

expect to continue to expand internationally, growing our share and increasing penetration of the international markets we've entered in recent years.
Competition
We provide cloud-based solutions enabling individuals, businesses and organizations to establish an online presence, connect with customers and manage their ventures. The market for providing these solutions is highly fragmented and competitive. These solutions are also rapidly evolving, creating opportunity for new competitors to enter the market with point-solution products or address specific segments of the market. In some instances, we have commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete. Given our broad product portfolio, we compete with niche point-solution products and broader solution providers. Our competitors include providers of:

• | domain registration services and web-hosting solutions such as Endurance, Donuts, United Internet, WP Engine and Web.com;


• | website creation and management solutions such as Automattic, Shopify, Squarespace, and Wix;


• | cloud-infrastructure services and online security providers such as CloudFlare, Comodo, Let's Encrypt, LiquidWeb and SiteGround;


• | alternative web presence, social platform and marketing solutions such as Constant Contact, MindBody, OpenTable, Facebook, Instagram, Yelp and Zillow; and


• | productivity tools such as business-class email, calendaring and messaging such as Google, Microsoft, Grasshopper, WeChat, WhatsApp and Zoho.

We expect continued competition from companies in the domain, hosting and presence markets such as Automattic, Endurance, Donuts, Squarespace, United Internet, Web.com and Wix. We also expect potential increased competition from companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, which are providers of web-hosting, Internet marketing, ecommerce and other cloud-based services.
We believe the principal competitive factors include: product capabilities meeting customer requirements, a secure, reliable and integrated technology platform, cost-effective customer acquisition, brand awareness and reputation, customer service and support and overall customer satisfaction. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. For additional information, see "Risk Factors."
Regulation
Our business is subject to regulation by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we do business.
ICANN. The registration of domain names is governed by ICANN. ICANN is a multi-stakeholder private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed in 1998 for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including management of the DNS, allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for all of these functions. We are accredited by ICANN as a domain name registrar and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with, and accreditation by, ICANN. The regulation of Internet domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries is subject to change. For example, in 2016, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or the NTIA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, transitioned oversight of key Internet domain name functions to the global multi-stakeholder community.
ccTLD Authorities. The regulation of ccTLDs is governed by national regulatory agencies of the country underlying the specific ccTLDs, such as China (.cn), Canada (.ca) and the U.K. (.uk). Our ability to sell ccTLDs is dependent on our and our partners' abilities to maintain accreditation in good standing with these various international authorities.
Advertising and promotional information presented on our websites and in our products, and our other marketing and promotional activities, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws regulating unfair and deceptive practices. U.S. federal, state, and foreign legislatures have also adopted laws and regulations regulating numerous other aspects of our business. Regulations relating to the Internet, including laws governing online content, user privacy and data protection, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction, are particularly relevant to our business. Such laws and regulations are discussed below.
15

Communications Decency Act (CDA). The CDA regulates content of material on the Internet, and provides immunity to Internet service providers and providers of interactive computer services for certain claims based on content posted by third parties. The CDA and the case law interpreting it generally provide that domain name registrars and website hosting providers cannot be liable for defamatory or obscene content posted by customers on registrars' servers unless they participate in creating or developing the content. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA), which became effective in April 2018, amend certain portions of the CDA, which may limit the immunity previously available to us under the CDA.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA provides domain name registrars and website hosting providers a safe harbor from liability for third-party copyright infringement. To qualify for the safe harbor, however, registrars and website hosting providers must satisfy numerous requirements, including adoption of a user policy providing for termination of service access of users who are repeat infringers, informing users of this policy, and implementing the policy in a reasonable manner. In addition, registrars and website hosting providers must expeditiously remove or disable access to content upon receiving a proper notice from a copyright owner alleging infringement of its protected works. A registrar or website hosting provider failing to comply with these safe harbor requirements may be found liable for copyright infringement.
Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA). The ACPA was enacted to address piracy on the Internet by curtailing a practice known as "cybersquatting," or the bad-faith registration of a domain name identical or similar to another party's trademark, or to the name of another living person, in order to profit from that name or mark. The ACPA provides that registrars may not be held liable for damages for registration or maintenance of a domain name for another person absent a showing of the registrar's bad faith intent to profit. Registrars may, however, be held liable if their activities are deemed outside the scope of basic registrar functions.
Lanham Act. The Lanham Act governs trademarks and false advertising. Case law interpreting the Lanham Act has limited liability for many online service providers such as search engines and domain name registrars. Nevertheless, there is no statutory safe harbor for trademark violations comparable to the provisions of the DMCA and we may be subject to a variety of trademark claims in the future.
Privacy and Data Protection. In the areas of personal privacy and data protection, the U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, and requirements associated with, the collection, distribution, use, storage, and security of personal information of individuals. In addition, in the European Union (E.U.) member states and certain other countries outside the U.S., data protection is more highly regulated and rigidly enforced. The E.U. has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took full effect on May 25, 2018, superseding the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive. The GDPR includes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, for companies established in the E.U. and those outside of the E.U. if they collect, use, or otherwise process personal data, including payment card information, imposes significant penalties for non-compliance and has broader extra-territorial effect. With our acquisition of HEG, and as we conduct and expand our business across Europe and elsewhere, we expect compliance with these regulatory schemes to be more burdensome and costly for us. In addition, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that will, among other things, require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information; the CCPA will go into effect on January 1, 2020.
Laws and regulations relating to our activities are unsettled in many jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible to comply with in some jurisdictions. Additionally, federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet and our activities in more and different ways than exist today. It also is impossible to predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending upon the type of such taxes, whether and how we would be affected. Laws and regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions may be applied in new or different manners in pending or future litigation. Further, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various jurisdictions, may be deemed to apply to our activities, or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality and access-related procedures and safeguards and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property.
We have also developed, acquired or licensed proprietary technologies for use in our business. As of December 31, 2018, we had 264 issued patents in the U.S. covering various aspects of our product offerings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had 109 pending U.S. patent applications and intend to file additional patent applications in the future.
We have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, as well as various procedural safeguards, we believe the skill and ingenuity of our employees, the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and our ability to introduce new products and features meeting the needs of our customers are more important to maintaining our competitive position in the marketplace.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the U.S. and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as the use of our major brand names in social media, domain names and other Internet sites.
Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary rights, and competitors may attempt to develop solutions that could compete with us in the markets we serve. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or proprietary technologies by our employees or third parties could also occur. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we continue to expand outside of the U.S.
Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap across industries. Third parties, including non-practicing patent holders, have from time to time claimed, and could claim in the future, that our processes, technologies or websites infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or be issued in the future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 6,821 employees worldwide, including 4,034 in our Customer Care team, 1,557 in technology and development, 341 in marketing and advertising and 889 in general and administrative. Excluded from our employee figures are nearly 2,300 Customer Care specialists located in Bulgaria, China, Colombia, India, Mexico, the Philippines and the U.K. who are directly employed by third-party partners, but who are dedicated to GoDaddy on a full time basis. Substantially all of our employees are based in the U.S. and Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to any collective bargaining agreement in connection with his or her employment with us. However, certain of our employees in Germany are represented by an employee works council pursuant to local regulations.
