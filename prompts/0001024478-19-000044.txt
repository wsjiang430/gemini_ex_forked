Item 1.    Business
General
Rockwell Automation, Inc. (“Rockwell Automation” or the “Company”) is a global leader in industrial automation and digital transformation. We connect the imaginations of people with the potential of technology to expand what is humanly possible, making the world more productive and more sustainable. Our hardware and software products, solutions and services are designed to meet our customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce enterprise business risk.
The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. 
As used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, “Rockwell Automation” or the “Company” include wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.
Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 4, 2020 (the Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), or in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (the Consolidated Financial Statements), the information is incorporated in that Item by reference. All date references to years and quarters refer to our fiscal year and quarters unless otherwise stated.
Operating Segments
We have two operating segments: Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions. Both operating segments share a common sales organization and supply chain and conduct business globally. Major markets served by both segments consist of discrete end markets (e.g., Automotive, Semiconductor, and Warehousing & Logistics), hybrid end markets (e.g., Food & Beverage, and Life Sciences), and process end markets (e.g., Oil & Gas, Metals, and Chemicals).
Geographic Information
We do business in more than 100 countries around the world. The largest sales outside the United States on a country-of-destination basis are in China, Canada, Italy, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our global operations. 
Competition
Our competitors range from large diversified corporations that may also have business interests outside of industrial automation to smaller companies that offer a limited portfolio of industrial automation products, solutions and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology differentiation, domain expertise, installed base, distribution network, quality of hardware and software products, solutions and services, global presence and price. Major competitors include Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Schneider Electric SA, Emerson Electric Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Honeywell International Inc.
Distribution
In most countries, we sell primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. In other countries, we sell through a combination of our direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through independent distributors. Approximately 75 percent of our global sales are through independent distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately 10 percent of our total sales.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, we had approximately 23,000 employees. Approximately 8,600 were employed in the United States.
Raw Materials
We purchase a wide range of equipment, components, finished products and materials used in our business. The raw materials essential to the manufacture of our products generally are available at competitive prices. We have a broad base of suppliers and subcontractors. We depend upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on third party suppliers.
Backlog
Our total order backlog consists of (in millions):

 | September 30,
 | 2019 | | 2018
Architecture & Software | $ | 174.7 | | | $ | 168.5 
Control Products & Solutions | 1,194.7 | | | 1,243.5 | 
 | $ | 1,369.4 | | | $ | 1,412.0

Backlog is not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods due to the short-cycle nature of most of our sales activities. Backlog orders scheduled beyond 2020 were approximately $225 million as of September 30, 2019. Backlog was reclassified in 2018 to conform to our current reportable segments. See Note 17 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
Environmental Protection Requirements
Information about the effect of compliance with environmental protection requirements and resolution of environmental claims is contained in Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with liabilities and costs related to environmental remediation.
Patents, Licenses and Trademarks
We own or license numerous patents and patent applications related to our hardware and software products and operations. While in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important in the operation of our business, we do not believe that loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect our business or financial condition. We have received various claims of patent infringement and requests for patent indemnification. We believe that none of these claims or requests will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property.
The Company’s name and its registered trademark “Rockwell Automation®” and other trademarks such as “Allen-Bradley®”, “A-B®” and “PlantPAx® Process Automation System™” are important to both of our business segments. In addition, we own other important trademarks that we use, such as “ControlLogix®” and “CompactLogix®” for our control systems, “PowerFlex®” for our AC drives, and “Rockwell Software®” and “FactoryTalk®” for our software offerings.
Seasonality
Our business segments are not subject to significant seasonality. However, the calendarization of our results can vary and may be affected by the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual budgeting processes and their working schedules.
