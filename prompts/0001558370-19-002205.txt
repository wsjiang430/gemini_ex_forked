 Overview
 Lumber Liquidators is one of the leading specialty retailers of hard-surface flooring in North America, offering a complete purchasing solution across an extensive assortment of domestic and exotic hardwood species, engineered hardwood, laminate, resilient vinyl, waterproof vinyl plank and porcelain tile. We also feature the renewable flooring products, bamboo and cork, and provide a wide selection of flooring enhancements and accessories, including moldings, noise-reducing underlayment, adhesives and flooring tools. We offer installation and delivery services through third-party independent contractors for customers who purchase our floors. We operate as a single business segment, with our call center, website and customer service network supporting our retail store operations.
 We believe we have achieved a reputation for offering great value, superior service and a broad selection of high-quality hard-surface flooring products. With a balance of selection, quality, availability, service and price, we believe our value proposition is the most complete within a highly fragmented hard-surface flooring market. The foundation for our value proposition is strengthened by our unique store model, the industry expertise of our people, and our singular focus on hard-surface flooring.
 Lumber Liquidators is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Toano, Virginia. We were founded in 1994 and our initial public offering was in November 2007. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “LL.” We operate in a holding company structure with Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. serving as our parent company and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Lumber Liquidators, Inc., Lumber Liquidators Services, LLC, Lumber Liquidators Production, LLC, and Lumber Liquidators Canada, ULC, conducting our operations.
 Our Business
 Market
 According to the July 2018 Issue of Floor Covering Weekly, U.S. installed floor covering product sales in 2017 were $40.8 billion, not including labor. Within this market, U.S. hardwood, laminate and vinyl flooring sales accounted for 38.7% of the total. Flooring sales are driven by a number of factors including discretionary income and the housing market. Including installation, the overall flooring industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2012 through 2017. Over the same period, hardwood, laminate and vinyl flooring sales, including the cost of installation grew at a compound annual growth rate of 8.3%. We believe improvements in the quality and construction of certain products, increasing resiliency and water-tolerance of products, ease of installation, availability in a broad range of retail price points, and movement away from soft surfaces will drive continued hard-surface flooring share gain versus soft surface flooring in the future. Competition
 We compete for customers in a highly fragmented marketplace, where we believe no one retailer has captured more than a 17% share of the consumer market for hard-surface flooring. Although the market includes the national home improvement warehouse chains, warehouse clubs and online retailers, we believe nearly half of the industry 

 
  4

 
consists of local one-store flooring retailers, small chains of stores that may specialize in one or two flooring categories, and a limited number of regional chains.
 Customers
 We target several distinct customer groups who each have varied needs with respect to their flooring purchases, including do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers, do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) customers, and commercial customers. We believe that each of the customer groups we serve is passionate about their flooring purchase and value our wide assortment of flooring products, availability, and the quality of those products. While our offering to each of these groups begins with the same broad assortment, convenient stores, and knowledgeable store associates, each of these customer groups require unique service components based on the ability of our associates to share detailed product knowledge and preferred installation methods. We offer DIFM customers installation services, while our DIY and commercial customers receive more personal attention when completing their purchase, including dedicated call center resources. All customer groups are offered delivery services. Products and Services
 Product Selection
 We offer an extensive assortment of hard-surface flooring under more than 15 proprietary brand names, led by our flagship, Bellawood®. We have invested significant resources developing these national brand names, as well as the Lumber Liquidators name. Our hard-surface flooring products are available in various widths and lengths and are generally differentiated in terms of quality and price based on wood versus manufactured materials, the species, wood grade and durability of finish. Prefinished floors are the dominant choice for residential customers over unfinished wood planks that have a finish applied after installation. We also offer an assortment of flooring enhancements, installation services and accessories, including moldings, underlays and tools. Direct Sourcing
 We source directly from mills and other vendors which enables us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality, proprietary products to our customers at a consistently competitive cost. We seek to establish strong, long-term relationships with our vendor partners around the world. In doing so, we look for vendors that have demonstrated an ability to meet our demanding specifications, our rigorous compliance standards and the capability to provide sustainable and growing supplies of high-quality innovative, trend-right products. We source from both domestic and international vendors, and in 2018, approximately 47% of our product was sourced from Asia, 7% was sourced from Europe and Australia, and 5% was sourced from South America. Supply Chain
 Our supply chain is wholly focused on delivering a complete assortment of products to our customers in an efficient manner. We operate a 500,000 square foot leased distribution center in Pomona, California as the primary distribution center for our western stores. We own a one million square foot distribution center on approximately 100 acres of land in Henrico County, Virginia, which serves the East Coast stores. A number of our vendors maintain certain inventory levels for shipment directly to our stores or our customers. Our product is generally transported boxed and palletized, and the weight of our product is a key driver of our supply chain costs. Compliance and Quality Control
 Our compliance programs are designed to ensure the products we sell are safe and responsibly sourced, and meet all regulatory and statutory requirements, including without limitation requirements associated with the Lacey Act, Environment Protection Agency ("EPA") and the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). We utilize a variety of due diligence processes and controls, including supplier audits, periodic on-site visits, and product testing. We utilize a risk-based approach to implement and operate the various aspects of our compliance program. Our compliance program considers, among other things, product risk, the level of vertical integration at our suppliers’ mills, legality concerns

noted by both private and government parties, and the results of on-site audits that we perform. Our evaluation of sourcing risk is a key component in our allocation of resources to ensure we meet our standards for product compliance and safety. Compliance and Quality Control teams located in the United States and in China are supplemented with external resources that provide independent analyses, which are incorporated into our review processes and monitor our sourcing efforts across all areas from which we source product. Compliance programs are continually under review, updated and enhanced as appropriate to stay current with statutory and regulatory requirements. Our compliance and regulatory affairs committee of the board of directors provides oversight of our compliance programs.
 Additionally, we maintain and operate a 1,500 square foot lab within our East Coast distribution center. The lab features two temperature and humidity controlled conditioning rooms and two emission chambers correlated to a CARB-approved Third-Party Certifier standard. We believe this equipment mirrors the capabilities of CARB and other state-of-the-art emission testing facilities. This lab, along with our third-party providers, supports our process to ensure compliance with CARB and EPA requirements.
 Installation
 Approximately one in 10 of our customers purchase professional installation services through us to measure and install flooring at competitive prices. We offer these services at all of our stores. As of December 31, 2018, we utilized a network of associates to perform certain customer-facing, consultative services and coordinate the installation of our flooring products by third-party independent contractors in our stores. Service revenue for installation transactions we control along with freight is included in net services sales, with the corresponding costs in cost of services sold. We believe our greater interaction with the customer and better relationships with the third-party independent contractors on services provided will ultimately result in a better customer experience and higher utilization by the customer. Store Model
 As of December 31, 2018, we operated 413 retail stores, with 405 located in 47 states in the United States and eight in Ontario, Canada. We opened 21 new stores and closed one store in 2018. We historically had sought locations with lower rent than retailers requiring high traffic or impulse purchases and are able to adapt a range of existing buildings to our format, from freestanding buildings to strip centers to small shopping centers. Our stores are typically 6,500 to 7,500 square feet. We enter into short leases, generally for a base term of five to seven years with renewal options, to maximize our real estate flexibility.
 We routinely evaluate our store site selection criteria and are currently targeting retail corridors within a market over the more industrial locations we historically sought. We consistently monitor performance of current stores as well as the market opportunity for new locations, adjusting as needed to optimize the profitability and growth potential of our network. We have recently opened a larger store format in a single-test location. This format includes a showroom that is four times the size of our traditional store, and includes more items in stock and other amenities.
 Sales Approach
 We strive to have an integrated multi-channel sales model that enables our stores, call center, website and catalogs to work together in a coordinated manner. We believe that due to the average size of the sale and the general infrequency of a flooring purchase, many of our customers conduct extensive research using multiple channels before making a purchase decision. Though our customers utilize a range of these channels in the decision-making process, the final sale is most often completed in the store, working with our flooring experts. Our customers typically plan well in advance for the inconvenience of removing old flooring and installing new flooring. In larger, more complex projects, greater lead time and preparation is often required. Our research indicates that the length of a hardwood flooring purchase can vary significantly from initial interest to final sale.
 Our objective is to help the customer through the entire purchase cycle from inspiration to installation, whether in our store or in their home. Our goal is to provide our customers with everything needed to complete their flooring project – to remove the existing floor, install the new floor with complementary moldings and accessories, and finally, maintain the floor for its lifetime.

 Our sales strategy emphasizes customer service by providing superior, convenient, educational tools for our customers to learn about our products and the installation process. We invest heavily in training our store associates on all of our products and install techniques. Flooring samples of most of the products we offer are available in our stores, or can be ordered through our call center and website. Once an order is placed, customers may choose to either have their purchases delivered or pick them up at a nearby store location.
 We are committed to responding to our potential and existing customers in a timely manner. Our call center is staffed by flooring experts cross-trained in sales, customer service and product support. In addition to receiving telephone calls, our call center associates chat online with visitors to our website, respond to emails from our customers and engage in telemarketing activities. Customers can contact our call center to place an order, to make an inquiry or to order a catalog.
 Knowledgeable Salespeople
 We believe a large segment of residential homeowners are in need of a trusted expert, whether as a guide through a range of flooring alternatives and services or as a resource to both DIY and DIFM customers. We train and position our store management and associates to establish these individual customer relationships, which often last beyond the current purchase to subsequent purchases of additional flooring.
 We place an emphasis on identifying, hiring and empowering employees who share a passion for our business philosophy. Many of our store managers have previous experience with the home improvement, retail flooring or flooring installation industries. We provide continuous training focused on selling techniques and in-depth product knowledge for our store associates, who, we believe, are a key driver in a customer’s purchasing decision.
 Digital / Omni-Channel
 Our website contains a broad range of information on our products and services, including a comprehensive knowledge base on all things related to flooring. We also offer extensive product reviews, before and after photos from previous customers, product information and how-to installation videos. A customer also has the ability to chat live with a flooring expert, either online or over the phone, regarding questions about a flooring purchase or installation. We continue to develop new features and functionality to assist customers, and to ensure they have robust tools at their disposal that are effective at helping them make the ideal flooring choice as they move between online and offline channels. We also have an active presence on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Twitter.
 Advertising and Financing
 Advertising: We utilize a mix of traditional and online media, ecommerce, direct mail, social media, and financing offers to emphasize product credibility, value, brand awareness, customer education and direct selling. We increase brand awareness in a variety of ways, including through sports, celebrity endorsements and product placement opportunities. Overall, we actively manage the mix of our media to efficiently drive sales while building brand awareness of our value proposition. We are investing in enhanced digital capabilities.
 Financing: We offer our residential customers a financing alternative through a proprietary credit card, the Lumber Liquidators credit card, underwritten by a third-party financial institution, generally with no recourse to us. This program serves the dual function of providing financial flexibility to our customers and offering us promotional opportunities featuring deferred interest, which we often combine with product promotions. Our customers may also use their Lumber Liquidators credit card for installation services. We also offer our commercial customers a financing alternative, which is also underwritten by a third-party financial institution, generally at no recourse to us. The commercial credit program provides our professional customers a range of additional services that we believe add efficiency to their businesses.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,200 employees, 95% of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of these employees, 72% work in our stores, 18% work in corporate store support infrastructure or similar functions (including our call center employees) and 10% work in one of our distribution centers. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. Seasonality and Quarterly Results
 Our quarterly results of operations can fluctuate depending on the timing of our advertising expenses and the timing of, and income contributed by, our new stores. Our net sales fluctuate slightly as a result of seasonal factors, and we adjust merchandise inventories in anticipation of those factors, causing variations in our build of merchandise inventories. Generally, we experience higher than average net sales in the spring and fall, when more home remodeling activities typically are taking place, and lower than average net sales in the colder winter months and during the hottest summer months.
