ITEM 1: BUSINESS.
Overview

NASCENT BIOTECH INC., a Nevada corporation (“Nascent” or the “Company”), is actively developing its primary asset, Pritumumab, for the treatment of brain cancer and pancreatic cancer. Nascent is also actively researching other cancers that have a high probability of benefiting from the therapeutic effects of Pritumumab because they share a common molecular target. Pritumumab has shown to have positive therapeutic effect at low doses in previous clinical studies in Japan. 
Current Business

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of various forms of cancer. We focus on biologic drug candidates that are undergoing or have already completed initial clinical testing for the treatment of cancer and then seek to further develop those drug candidates for commercial use. We currently own a drug candidate, Pritumumab, which we are developing. 

We are focused on developing Pritumumab for the treatment of patients with brain cancer malignancies such as glioblastoma and malignant astrocytoma. Pritumumab is a monoclonal antibody that had been clinically tested in Phase I and Phase II trials in 249 human brain cancer patients in the nation of Japan. The objectives of the Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials were to determine the safety of Pritumumab in humans and its efficacy in eliminating tumors or reducing tumor size in patients with brain cancer. These clinical trials were conducted at over 20 clinical sites within Japan during a 14-year time period (1988 to 2002). All patients were treated with a 1mg dose of Pritumumab, either once or twice a week, for 24 weeks, and were evaluated over extended periods of time. The sponsor of those trials was the Hagiwara Institute of Health (HIH). Manufacturing of Pritumumab was conducted by the Japanese contract research organization, Japan Pharmaceutical Development, and all pre-clinical development work was performed at HIH. At the end of the Phase II trials, data from 126 of these patients were analyzed – under then-current Japanese efficacy standards – and presented to the Japanese Ministry of Health & Welfare (MHW). The HIH was approved for expanded Phase III trials in humans; however, the founder of HIH passed away and the clinical development of Pritumumab was abandoned by his surviving heirs. An issue at that time was the ability to manufacture enough Pritumumab to continue clinical trials. The product was never approved for sale in Japan or elsewhere. Currently, therapeutic strategies, such as the use of the chemotherapy drug Temodar®, or surgical strategies, are used for the treatment of this cancer. However, there still exists a sizable need in the marketplace to develop safer, more effective drugs as Temodar is attributed to only median rates of survival and many brain tumors are ineligible for surgery. Moreover, even when removed, many brain tumors come back within one year post-operation. Today, with current standards of care, only 58% of all brain cancer patients will live past the first year after diagnosis, and with certain types of brain cancer, for example, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, the five-year survival rates are 27% and 5%, respectively

Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies to date, we believe that Pritumumab may offer an advantage over existing treatments by binding to a molecule on the outer surface of cancer cells called ectodomain vimentin (also referred to as cell-surface vimentin). This particular target, referred to generally as an antigen, is prevalent in many different tumor types and is not being targeted by any other biopharmaceutical companies. By binding to this target, Pritumumab is able to make the tumor cells “known” to the body’s immune system, resulting in potentially several types of immune responses, including anti-idiotype, apoptosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, leading to death of the cancer cells and overall depletion of the tumor. 

Data from the Japanese clinical studies of Pritumumab administered as a single agent to brain cancer patients with a range of tumor types (but primarily glioblastoma and malignant astrocytoma) demonstrated a collective rate of partial remission (tumor volume reduction greater than 51%) plus complete remission of 15%, and a stable disease rate of an additional 50% (stable disease defined as +25% to -50% change in tumor volume) – as measured by a standard formulary from MRI and X-ray imaging. Additionally, data from the 126 patients treated with Pritumumab submitted to the MHW also suggested a manageable and predictable safety profile. Of the 126 patients evaluated for safety, only 14 showed adverse events, 8 of which were judged to be possibly caused by administration of Pritumumab, and all of which resolved over time. There were no serious adverse events noted.

We expect to amplify on the past clinical development strategy during the next 12 months plan to:


· | commence Phase I clinical trials in the United States, establishing the optimal dose of Pritumumab for treatment of patients with brain cancers; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | commence ongoing studies with Pritumumab for the treatment of lung cancer and breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain; 
· | continue to evaluate the application of Pritumumab in the treatment of other forms of ectodomain vimentin positive cancers (for example, cancers of epithelial origin such as pancreatic, lung and colon) where there may be unmet medical needs.


The Company filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for Phase I clinical trials on March 31, 2017. The FDA place the submission on clinical hold requesting more data and clarification of some parts of the submission. On March 31, 2018, the Company amended its IND filing and, again, was not cleared to begin clinical trials by the FDA. On December 7, 2018 the Company received FDA clearance on its drug product lot to begin clinical trials. On May 6, 2019 the Company filed a submission with the FDA to gain complete release of the partial clinical hold. The Company is working with a clinic and plans to commence the Phase I clinical trials during the third quarter of the calendar year. 

Brain Cancer Incidence and Prevalence 

In the United States, the annual estimated new cases of brain cancer each year are about 23,000, with estimated deaths about 15,000 per year. Brain cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in patients younger than age 20. Gliomas (a broad term which includes all tumors arising from the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain), the cancer type for which orphan drug designation has been granted by the FDA, account for 80% of all malignant brain tumors.

5


Secondary brain cancer (metastases to the brain from other sites) occurs in 20–40% of patients with metastatic disease and incidence increases with age. In the United States, over 100,000 cases of secondary brain cancer are diagnosed each year, with the majority of those metastases originating from lung (50%) and breast (15-20%).

Our Goal and Strategy

Our goal is to become a leading oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:


· | Advance Pritumumab, our drug candidate, toward regulatory approval and commercialization. We are primarily focused on developing Pritumumab for the treatment of patients’ brain tumors, as well as lung and breast cancer metastases to the brain. We plan to focus our planned Phase I/II clinical trials on the use of Pritumumab to include the metastatic treatment option, which we believe may be underserved by current treatment alternatives and where clinical trials have shown substantial levels of activity. Importantly, we will employ significantly higher doses in the clinical protocol to test for safety and increased efficacy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Expand our claims by pursuing additional indications for Pritumumab, due to the fact that the target antigen (ectodomain vimentin) is present in a variety of cancers apart from brain cancer. Nascent will seek to expand Pritumumab into as many different indications as possible. We also believe Pritumumab could be an effective carrier protein for other anti-cancer drugs (a cocktail approach in which an anti-cancer drug is attached to an antibody) and we also believe we can develop Pritumumab as a diagnostic tool. 
· | Evaluate the commercialization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of each. As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate’s commercialization strategy. These options include entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical company or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing our product, whereby another pharmaceutical company or biotechnology company sells and markets our product and pays us on a developmental milestone and royalty on sales basis. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors, including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market that needs to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is too early for us to know which of these options we will pursue for our drug candidates, assuming their successful development.

Pritumumab in Cancer Patients

Our initial focus is on the development of Pritumumab as an intravenous treatment of patients with various types of brain cancer, most prominently gliomas and malignant astrocytomas.
Advantages of Pritumumab

Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies to date, we believe that Pritumumab may offer an advantage over existing treatments that are used in the treatment of patients’ brain malignancies and other various forms of cancer. The antibody utilizes a fully human, natural approach which we believe results in the molecule posing very little toxicity to the patient, particularly in comparison to chemotherapies, radiation and cytokine approaches that currently dominate the marketplace. Further, the antibody binds to a very novel target that appears to be prevalent in a number of solid tumors. A fully human approach will mimic and harness the body’s natural defense system to fight cancer and offer an efficacious and safer approach to other protocols, such as chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, which can be devastating and life threatening in and of themselves. 
Disadvantages of Pritumumab

Given the low survival rates for current standard therapy in brain cancer, the Japanese clinical data indicating very few adverse events, both in percentage and type, and the general safety associated with monoclonal antibodies currently approved in the United States for a variety of therapeutic indications, we believe that there are no disadvantages of Pritumumab to current therapy.

6

Development Plan

We plan to conduct a US-based clinical trial of pritumumab in patients with brain cancer over the next 12 to 18 months. In this trial, we also plan to further investigate the efficacy of Pritumumab on metastatic brain cancer and measure the effects on the primary tumor. Our Phase I trial is also planned as multiple ascending dose study employing significantly higher doses to test for safety and improved efficacy.

We believe we can complete the Phase I and phase II studies indicated above within a period of about 36 months and for a total cost of less than $15 million dollars. This will, of course, require funding our planned capital raises as discussed elsewhere in this document.

Clinical Testing of Our Products in Development

Each of our products in development, and likely all future drug candidates, will require extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing to determine the safety and efficacy of the product prior to seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for marketing and sale of the product. This process is expensive and time consuming. In completing this pre-clinical and clinical testing, we are dependent upon third-party consultants, consisting mainly of investigators, collaborators, and contract research organizations, who will conduct such testing.

We and our third-party consultants conducted pre-clinical testing in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and clinical testing in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which are international ethical and scientific quality standards utilized for pre-clinical and clinical testing, respectively. GCP is the standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis and reporting of clinical trials, and is required by the FDA to be followed in conducting clinical trials. Additionally, any pre-clinical and clinical testing completed in the European Union, or the EU, is conducted in accordance with applicable EU standards, such as the EU Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC of April 4, 2001), or the EU Clinical Trials Directive, and the national laws of the Member States of the EU implementing its provisions.

Intellectual Property

The US Food & Drug Administration has granted the Company orphan drug designation for use of Pritumumab against gliomas and pancreatic cancer. If we obtain marketing approval for Pritumumab or other drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as seven years of market exclusivity under FDA orphan drug designation, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act, 8 to 11 years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially available for new drugs in the European Union, up to five years of patent extension in Europe (Supplemental Protection Certificate), and eight years of data exclusivity potentially available in Japan. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See “Government Regulation” below.

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property and potential products, and if we cannot obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property and potential products, we may not be able to successfully market our potential products.”

We will depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

Former License-

On October 12, 2017 the Company signed a consulting agreement with a former license holder. Under the terms of the agreement the Company, commencing February 1, 2018 will pay the consultant $1,000 per month for 24 months. In addition, the Company will pay the consultant an additional $24,000 during the term of the agreement at the Company’s discretion. In return, the consultant will forgive all royalty payments plus any past claims to the product per the previous agreement dated September 21, 2015, plus provide consulting services to the Company as directed by the Company. As of March 31, 2019 the outstanding obligation to the consultant was $34,000.
Manufacturing

We do not currently have our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to continue to use our financial resources to accelerate development of our drug candidates rather than diverting resources to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to meet our pre-clinical and clinical trial manufacturing requirements by continuing established relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. We intend to continue these third-party relationships to maintain our supply of Pritumumab. Should Pritumumab obtain marketing approval, we anticipate establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers for the commercial production and manufacture of our product. We have some flexibility in securing other manufacturers to produce our drug candidates; however, our alternatives may be limited due to proprietary technologies or methods used in the manufacture of some of our drug candidates.
Competition

The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty cancer companies. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new cancer products. Our potential competitors include, but are not limited to, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Takeda, Array Biopharma and Ambit Biosciences. We are an early stage company with no history of operations and we only recently acquired the rights to the drug candidates we expect to develop. Many of our competitors have substantially more resources than we do, including both financially and technically. In addition, many of our competitors have more experience than us in pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of cancer. We anticipate that we will face intense competition.

We expect that our products under development and in clinical trials will address major markets within the cancer sector. Our competition will be determined in part by the indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors’ products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement and patent position.

Government Regulation

United States—FDA Process

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs) or Biologics License Applications (BLAs), warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. In the case of Pritumumab, it is a biologic drug and the appropriate route for approval will be to submit a BLA.

Drug Approval Process. None of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:


· | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Development of a manufacturing process in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations; 
· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for human clinical testing, which must pass FDA review before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication; 
· | submission to the FDA of a BLA (Biologics License Application) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs); and,
· | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 


The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

As noted above, the Company has received approval to commence human clinical trials with its currently-manufactured drug product lot, and is awaiting FDA approval to employ further drug product lots manufacturing from its current drug substance lot.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as part of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and it must monitor the study until it is completed. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial.

Clinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and determine appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form. There can be no assurance that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, the Company, the FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Moreover, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after BLA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain time points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach an agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If a Phase 3 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, the purpose of which is to reach an agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA unless public health concerns unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment are evident, and may not be changed except under a few specific circumstances.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop and validate methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. A BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which we anticipate will be waived for the first BLA because NBI is a “qualified small business.”

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The agency reviews the application and may deem it to be inadequate to support the registration, and companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMPs. If the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, an approvable letter followed by an approval letter. Both letters usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions.

The FDA may deny approval of a BLA by issuing a Complete Response Letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Alternatively, approval may occur with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 


10

Expedited Review and Approval

The FDA has various programs, including Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for accelerated approval. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists and provides for an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.

Post-Approval Requirements

Oftentimes, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA, typically a new BLA or NDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.

If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to: (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We intend to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall of the product from the market or withdrawal of approval of the BLA for that drug.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials and approval of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU, or Member States, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:


· | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. The competent authority of the Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the specific product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the Reference Member State, the product is subsequently granted a National MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the Reference Member State and the Member States Concerned).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic product. For example, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the EEA, we expect they will benefit from 8 years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional non-cumulative one year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first 8 years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EU and prevents generics from relying on the marketing authorization holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of 8 years. After 8 years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. However, a generic cannot launch until 2 years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or 3 years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the 8 year data exclusivity period. In Japan, our products may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for such regulatory exclusivity, or that such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies.

When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent Member State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial.

Pricing and Reimbursement

In the United States and internationally, sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. We may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part.

In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted that could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market.

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, enacted in March 2010, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, PPACA establishes:


· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, or the donut hole; and
· | a formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. 


In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Future legislation, including the current versions being considered at the federal level in the United States or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation, may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Because the adoption of certain proposals could limit the prices, we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products, substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products by third-party payers.

Sales and Marketing

We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. We do, however, have worldwide commercialization rights for our drug candidates. In order to commercialize any of our drug candidates if and when they are approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere, we will need to develop the necessary marketing, sales and distribution capabilities.

The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to collect additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.

Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.

Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.

We may also be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.

Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the penalties that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government was to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Further, there is an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to provide reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.

Other Laws and Regulatory Processes

We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and, if our capital stock becomes listed on a national securities exchange, we will be subject to the regulations of such exchange on which our shares are traded. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our financial statements and other public disclosure are constantly discussing and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses.

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
