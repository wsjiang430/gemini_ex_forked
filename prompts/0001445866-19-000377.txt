Item 1. Description of Business
Company Background
    Cannabis Sativa, Inc., formerly named Ultra Sun Corporation was incorporated under laws of Nevada in November, 2005.  We conduct some of our operations through our subsidiaries Wild Earth Naturals, Inc., a Nevada corporation, iBudtender, Inc., a Colorado corporation, Eden Holdings LLC, a Virginia limited liability company, Kubby Patent and Licenses, Limited Liability Company, a Texas limited liability company and Hi Brands International Inc., a Nevada corporation. We acquired a wholly-owned subsidiary named Kush, a Nevada corporation, in June 2014 in exchange for shares of our common stock.  Since November 2015, Kush has been spun off and is no longer a subsidiary of the Company.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. ("Wild Earth") was acquired by us in July 2013 in exchange for shares of our common stock.  We acquired a 50.1% interest in our subsidiary iBudtender, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiary iBudtender, LLC, a California limited liability company (collectively, "iBudtender") in August of 2016 in exchange for cash and shares of our common stock. Effective August 1, 2017, we acquired a 51% interest in PrestoCorp, a Delaware corporation, in exchange for shares of our common stock. From our inception through September 30, 2013, we were engaged in the tanning salon business and operated a tanning salon in Saratoga Springs, Utah under the name "Sahara Sun Tanning."  As a result of our acquisition of Wild Earth in July 2013, we became engaged in the herbal skin care products business.  On September 30, 2013, we sold the assets of the tanning salon business to a third party.
    Our common stock is quoted for trading on the OTC Market QB under the symbol CBDS.
    Our principal executive offices are located at 1646 W. Pioneer Blvd., Suite 120, Mesquite, Nevada  89027. Our telephone number is (702) 346-3906.
    Business Strategy

5

   We are engaged in the research, development, acquisition and licensing of specialized cannabis related products, including cannabis formulas, edibles, topicals, strains, recipes and delivery systems.  We also are engaged in marketing and branding within the cannabis space, including our trademark pending "hi" brand and others. We hold a license for a proprietary cannabis lozenge delivery methodology, and a proprietary cannabis trauma cream formula.  We have recently been awarded a U.S. patent for a strain of cannabis plant named Ecuadorian Sativa (also referred to as CTS-A or CTA).  We also have U.S. patents pending on cannabis-based compositions and methods of treating hypertension and a lozenge delivery system. We plan to license our intellectual property, including patents, branding and know-how to companies licensed under, and in full compliance with, state regulations applicable to cannabis businesses.
 
Through our iBudtender subsidiary, we are in the technology space with proprietary software, and an application (the “iBudtender App”) focused on sharing information between cannabis products, patients and businesses, which application we plan releasing in 2019. The iBudtender App will feature patient reviews, nutritional information, directions, warnings, local availability and more.  We intend to monetize this technology through advertisements, business to business sales and additional technology offerings.
 
Through its 51% owned subsidiary PrestoCorp, the Company operates a proprietary online telemedicine service that allows patients to use secure a confidential video conference technology to speak with a licensed physician for a medical marijuana evaluation. PrestoCorp currently offers its services in California, Nevada and New York and is actively targeting expansion into additional states where medical marijuana is legal.
 
In addition to licensing, branding and technology, we have the ability to offer, free of charge to patients, mainstream medical prescription discount cards, for which the Company will receive a small percentage on each prescription refill with the hi Benefits Discount Pharmacy Card. The Company has yet to receive monies from prescription refills but expects to do so once cards are distributed and the program implemented. Furthermore, the Company continues to seek the acquisition of companies, intellectual property and other assets that fit within the company's strategic plan of assembling a portfolio of cannabis industry related businesses that have a high growth potential and are accretive to shareholder value.
 
Wild Earth Naturals, Inc.
 
Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. is an herbal skin care products formulation and marketing company that targets the growing natural health care products market in the United States and abroad.  We develop and manufacture high-quality, herbal based skin care products providing healthier choices to consumers.  We use specialized ingredient mixing processes to produce plant glycerite/mineral herbal blends and oil extractions, which we believe will be unique to the natural health products industry.  The ingredients for our products are and will continue to be selected to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to: safety, potency, purity, stability, bio-availability, and efficacy.  We plan to control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage and continuing through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.

Perceived Cannabis Industry Trends
 
We believe the cannabis industry will be characterized by the following principal trends: an 

7

increased emphasis on high quality products; an increased emphasis on scientific validation for products in the market place; more liberal regulation in regard to cannabis, even under the current administration as states' rights continue to emerge; more consolidation, take-over, and buy-out of companies in the retail, wholesale, and supply side channels; more mainstream companies entering the marketplace; and more funded research on the potential long-term health benefits of cannabis as well as its potential curative properties.
Vision
 
Our vision is to become a highly visible, diversified, international business promoting superior quality branded products and offering effective customer service, fair compensation, sound management and a great working environment. Over time, we plan to expand our branding, research and development, intellectual properties and licensing activities to reach markets worldwide.  In order to achieve this vision, our goal is to develop and/or acquire intellectual property which will allow our licensees to provide innovative and effective medicinal cannabis products and cost-effective alternatives for customers seeking quality, affordable natural health products to aid in wellness and appearance.  In conducting our day-to-day operations, we will strive to:
 
• Treat all colleagues and co-workers with respect & fairness.
 
• Follow a philosophy that says, "Delivering quality and customer satisfaction is our business."
 
• Develop and enhance the skills of its associates with the intention of providing financially rewarding business opportunities.
 
Through a long-term commitment to this vision statement, we hope to become known as a company that is committed to its customers, associates, and communities.
 
Products
 
Online Telemedicine. Through PrestoDoctor we provide access to knowledgeable physicians for a safe and confidential way to get a medical marijuana recommendation using secure video conferencing technology. Our online telemedicine generates over 95% of our revenues. Through December 31, 2018, the balance of the products discussed below in this section have produced no significant revenues.
 
Proprietary Cannabis Strain. The Company owns a patented cannabis sativa plant strain known as Ecuadorian Sativa or "CTA".  The Company intends to further research the CTA strain and to ultimately monetize this intellectual property through licensing agreements in conjunction with state medical marijuana laws as well as establish business relationships with scientific research organizations to develop agricultural biologic applications based upon specific plant strain research and development methodologies.
 
Lozenges and Edibles. The Company owns intellectual property (recipes and process/methods) for use in medical marijuana edibles and lozenges.  The Company's proprietary lozenge is unlike other edibles of which may take up to an hour or more to take effect. Based upon preliminary results, our lozenges generally take effect within a period of five to 15 minutes.  We believe the rapid acting 

8

characteristics of our lozenges will overcome a major issue with cannabis consumption, which has been the need to inhale cannabis in order to receive a rapid response.  In addition to the lozenges, we have other forms of edibles under development.
 
Recover. Recover Deep Penetrating Healing Balm is a fast acting anti-inflammatory pain reliever for sore muscles, joints, arthritic and back pain. Organic with hemp seed oil, menthol, capsicum, and black pepper.
 
Trauma Cream. Developed for blended infusion of cannabinoids and THC; Arnica is a primary ingredient for its numbing effect.
 
Face Garden.  An antioxidant, moisturizing cream for the face.  The ingredients in this formula include DMAE, Vitamins Ester C, B5, Oils of Evening Primrose and Borage Seed, which are believed to firm the skin and reduce puffiness and wrinkles, while restoring the skin to a natural glow and supple appearance. Hempseed, Neem, and Jojoba Oils are added to lock in moisture.
 
Body Garden.  A moisturizing body lotion designed to relieve itchy dry skin and protect against sun damage.  The ingredients in this formula include Hempseed Oil, Green Tea, and Blue Green Algae. The organic herbs, essential oils, butters, and minerals used in "Body Garden" have been formulated to provide nutrition to the skin which we believe encourages the dermis to remain healthy or return to health.
 
Lip Garden.  An emollient balm containing Vitamin E and Hemp Butter that we believe can assist with healing of the lips while keeping them supple and moist.
 
Clothing and Merchandise. We offer Wild Earth Naturals and "hi" branded logo men's and women's fashion tee shirts and sweatshirts from American Apparel, as well as caps and coffee mugs through the Company's www.wildearthnaturals.com website. However, as of the date of this filing the website is not operational. We expect that it will be operational again later in 2019. 
 
Objectives
 
Our current strategy is to continue prosecution of the pending patents, to develop and acquire new patents, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property. In addition, we will seek new branding and licensing opportunities for our intellectual property and we will seek strategic corporate and product acquisitions.
Marketing & Distribution
 
Market Conditions in the Cannabis Industry
 
Our target markets are those where states have legalized the production and use of cannabis.  Ten states plus the District of Columbia have approved measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use.  Thirty-two states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form. However, it may take multiple years for a state to establish regulations and for cannabis businesses to begin generating revenue from operations in a given state.

Non-Infused Products and Merchandise
 
We launched our wildearthnaturals.com website in August 2013, employing high quality graphic artists and designers. We use social media, primarily Facebook, to drive traffic to our websites.  Our online stores at www.wildearthnaturals.com are producing sales at this time.
 
During 2019, we plan to utilize direct business to business sales, internet advertising, social media market, and trade show participation to generate sales leads, orders and to entry into leading retailers and wholesalers throughout the U.S.  No assurances can be given that we will be successful in such efforts.
 
Infused Products
 
For cannabis infused products, we are developing our customer base through licensing agreements with third parties who are compliant with state cannabis laws in the states in which they conduct business.
 
We plan to build brand awareness by utilizing a mix of social media, trade shows, education efforts, and direct marketing to targeted businesses.
 
Geographic Presence
 
We plan to build brand awareness for our products in states where medical cannabis is legal, and to sell non-infused products throughout the United States.
 
Competition
 
Cannabis Industry
 
While we do not sell cannabis, we expect to license our intellectual property to others in the future who do sell cannabis in states where medicinal cannabis is legal.  Therefore, we look to the participants in the medical cannabis market for information on competition, as such competition will have an effect on our ability to license our branding and other intellectual property.
 
We believe the competition in the cannabis market will include numerous cannabis product companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories – with companies taking a state by state approach.  We believe that competition is principally based upon price, quality, efficacy of products, branding, marketing, customer service, and trade support.  We anticipate that large pharmaceutical companies may begin to compete in the cannabis product market. These companies and certain larger entities may have broader product lines and/or larger sales volumes than companies such as ours our those of our licensees.  Larger entities entering this market may have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. We anticipate that many of the larger competitors will be able to compete more effectively due to a greater extent of vertical integration. The entry of larger competitors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Skin Care

10

Our competition includes numerous skin care companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels, and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies compete with us in the skin care market.  These companies and certain large entities have broader product lines and larger sales volumes than us and have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. Among our more prominent competitors are: Earthly Body, Burt's Bees, Melaleuca and Clarins, all of which have substantially longer track records and greater financial resources and operating efficiencies than do we. As a company with limited capital resources, we believe will be at a competitive disadvantage until such time as we develop a broad portfolio of products that are known and accepted in the industry and we are able to demonstrate a history of financial stability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the market.
Technology
 
The competition against our information technology platform iBudtender.com and the iBudtender App, both of which will be released in 2019, include companies such as Weedmaps, Leafly, MassRoots, and Leafstrain.  Competition in the information technology market for cannabis is growing rapidly and many of our competitors are have more experience and greater financial resources than do we. As a company with limited capital resources, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in a rapidly changing information technology market.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
Our products are produced using ingredients that we believe to be readily available from several sources. We purchase our raw materials from a number of different vendors. Our apparel and merchandise are procured through Printful.com.
Intellectual Property
 
We hold certain intellectual property (the "IP") consisting of recipe and process/method to maximize the cannabinoid concentrations to be used to make a medical marijuana ("MMJ") edible or to make a MMJ lozenge.  We also hold rights to a proprietary recipe and process/method to maximize the cannabinoid concentrations to be used to make a salve/ointment containing CBD and Arnica Montana.
 
We also hold the rights of a patent for the CTA strain of cannabis and we hold two patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with regard to use of the CTA strain in a lozenge and as a treatment for hypertension. We are continuing to pursue these applications; however, no assurances can be given that the remaining patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents.
 
We are also pursuing the "hi" mark in several categories filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. An objection has been filed by Tweed Corporation which wishes to use the mark on apparel. Settlement talks are ongoing.  The Company uses (or licenses) the "hi" branding for skin care products, edibles (infused and non-infused), apparel and branded merchandise.

11

We hold a Federal trademark on the name and stylized branding of "Wild Earth Naturals".  We have acquired the following registered U.S. Trademarks: Cannabis*Sativa(R), DISPENSARxY(R), and CannaRx(R). The IP identifiers are Cannabis*Sativa(R), Registration Number 4,868,622, DISPENSARxY(R), Registration Number 4,642,830 and CannaRx(R), Registration Number 4,725,687. The Marks are registered in CL 35 under Goods and Services.  No assurance can be given that such steps as the company has and will take will provide sufficient protection against potential competitors and we may be unable to successfully assert our intellectual property rights or these rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  Any such invalidity, particularly with respect to our product names, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") defines Schedule I controlled substances as "the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence." If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis.  The new administration under President Trump could decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. See Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement discussed below. Any such change in the federal government's enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government.
 
The Company and our licensed products will also be subject to a number of other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  We anticipate that our licensees and vendors will be required to manufacture our products in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and will be subject to regulations relating to employee safety, working conditions, protection of the environment, and other items.  The current administration has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the cannabis industry, in particular, recreational marijuana.  Changes in laws, rules and regulations or the recall of any product by a regulatory authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
In addition to cannabis related regulations, our skin care and nutraceuticals products are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  We are required to manufacture our products in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and we are also subject to regulations relating to employee safety, working conditions, protection of the environment, and 

12

other items.  Changes in such laws, rules and regulations or the recall of any product by a regulatory authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement
 
Because of the inconsistencies in federal and state law, on January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing what it deemed to be a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents which would include the so called Cole Memorandum. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. In the memorandum, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directs all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. The DOJ asserts this return to the rule of law is also a return of trust and local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs. 
 
"It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission," said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. "Therefore, today's memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country."
 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the enforcement priorities of the Department of Justice.
 
Research and Development
 
We plan to conduct research, develop products and engage in development activities with an initial focus on the following:
 
• Identify and research new strains of cannabis and combinations of cannabis and cannabinoid nutrients that may be candidates for new products;
 
• Identify and research products, including intellectual property, that will benefit enhance or benefit the cannabis industry, from cultivation to consumers;
 
• Introduce new herbal ingredients for use in supplements;
 
• Study the metabolic activities of existing and newly identified ingredients;
 
• Enhance existing products, as new discoveries in cannabis are made;
 
• Formulate products to meet diverse regulatory requirements across all of its markets;

13

• Investigate processes for improving the production of its formulated products; and
 
• Investigate activities of natural extracts and formulated products in laboratory and clinical settings.
 
It is through our internal research and development efforts and our relationships with outside research organizations and health care providers that we believe we will be able to develop high quality products. We plan for our research and development activities to include developing products that are new to the industry, updating existing formulas to keep them current with the latest science, and adapting existing formulas to meet ever-changing regulations in new and existing domestic markets.  We will select our ingredients to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to: safety, potency, purity, stability, bio-availability, and efficacy. We will require our licensees and vendors to control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage, and maintain quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.  Going forward, we intend to increase our spending and resources for research and development.
Environmental Laws
 
We have no known costs, and none are anticipated, from environmental laws, rules and regulations.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
As of March 20, 2019, we had one employee, not including our five executive officers who receive non-cash salary.  Our employees are not represented by unions and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. The Company also has relationships with several independent contractors who provide services to the Company on a regular and on-going basis.
Facilities
 
Our office and warehouse facility is located at 1646 W. Pioneer Blvd., Suite 120, Mesquite, Nevada.  The leased space constitutes a total of approximately 900 square feet.  The building is in an industrial park setting, and a new exit off of Interstate 15 was recently completed, indicating more growth in the area which is the fastest growing city in Nevada. We pay a total of $600 per month for our space. We signed a new 12 month lease on September 1, 2018, that has an option to renew of an addition 12 months.
 
Our subsidiary PrestoDoctor leases an office in New York for $800 per month.
