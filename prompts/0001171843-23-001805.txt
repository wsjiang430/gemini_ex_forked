Overview
 
Predictive Oncology Inc. (“Predictive Oncology”) is a knowledge-driven company focused on applying artificial intelligence (“AI”) to support the development of optimal cancer therapies, which can ultimately lead to more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes. Through AI, Predictive Oncology uses a biobank of 150,000+ cancer tumor samples, categorized by patient type, against drug compounds to help the drug discovery process and increase the probability of success. The company offers a suite of solutions for oncology drug development from early discovery to clinical trials.
 
We operate in four primary business areas: first, the application of AI for optimized, high-confidence drug-response predictions within a large experimental space that enables a more informed selection of drug/tumor combinations to increase the probability of success during development; second, creation and development of tumor-specific 3D cell culture models driving accurate prediction of drug response with high correlation to clinical response; third, contract services and research focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production, and; fourth, production of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-cleared STREAMWAY® System for automated, direct-to-drain medical fluid disposal and associated products.
 
We have four reportable segments: Helomics®, zPREDICTA®, SolubleTM and Skyline®. The Helomics segment provides services that include the application of AI, collaboration projects and clinical testing. Our zPREDICTA, Inc. (“zPREDICTA”) segment specializes in organ-specific disease models that provide 3D reconstruction of human tissues more accurately representing each disease state and mimicking drug response enabling accurate testing of anticancer agents. Our Soluble segment provides services using a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens, using additives and excipients commonly included in protein formulations resulting in soluble and physically stable formulations for biologics. Our Skyline segment consists of the STREAMWAY System product sales. Going forward, we have determined that we will focus our resources on applying AI to support the development of optimal cancer therapies, partnering with biopharma clients to help prioritize drugs for development and identify biomarker-informed indications. Our platform provides a more informed decision tool to select optimal drug/tumor combinations to increase the probability of success during drug development. As a result of this focused approach, we have consolidated our brand under the Predictive Oncology name. Going forward, we will operate under the Predictive Oncology tradename with laboratory operations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Birmingham, Alabama.

HELOMICS 
 
Our proprietary AI-driven platform, conducted in our Helomics division, is committed to optimizing, high-confidence drug-response predictions within a large experimental space. Using our proprietary, multi-omic tumor profiling platform, a one-of-a-kind database of historical tumor data, and the power of AI to build predictive models of tumor drug response. Our Patient-centric Drug Discovery using Active Learning asset (“PEDAL”™) is a unique technology that combines the largest privately held commercial biobank of oncology tumor samples, AI technology and historical drug response data—complete with an on-site wet lab for streamlined drug/tumor prediction evaluation. PEDAL offers researchers the opportunity to efficiently and cost-effectively bring patient diversity much earlier in the drug discovery process. PEDAL works by iterative cycles of active-learning powered Learn-Predict-Test to guide the testing of patient-specific compound responses to build a comprehensive predictive model of patient responses to compounds. This predictive model can then be used to rank compounds by the fraction of tumor samples of certain profiles that respond as well as the set of compounds that provide the best coverage across patients.
 
We believe leveraging our unique, historical database of the drug responses of over 150,000 patient tumor samples to build AI and data-driven multi-omic predictive models of tumor drug response and outcome will provide actionable insights critical to new drug development. Through the course of over 15 years of clinical testing of the responses of patient tumors to drugs, Helomics has amassed a huge proprietary knowledgebase of 150,000 patient cases. This dataset has been rigorously de-identified and aggregated to build a unique, proprietary model of tumor drug response. Thus, PEDAL can significantly increase the probability of clinical success, leading to a dramatic improvement in both the therapeutic success, time, and cost of your oncology discovery programs.
 
Our large knowledgebase of tumor drug response and other data, together with proven AI, has created a unique capability for oncology drug discovery that allows for the highly efficient screening of drug responses from thousands of diverse, well-characterized patient primary tumor samples. This novel disruptive patient-centric approach is ideally suited to the early part of drug discovery, resulting in better prioritization of compounds and better coverage of tumor diversity. This will dramatically improve the chances of successfully translating discoveries, resulting in lowered costs, shortened timelines, and most importantly enhanced “speed-to-patient” for new therapies.
 
Business Strategy for Drug Discovery Solutions
 
We are a data and AI-driven discovery services company that provides AI-driven predictive models of tumor drug response to improve clinical outcomes for patients. A key part of our commercialization strategy is the understanding that our AI-driven models of tumor drug response serve a key unmet need of pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries for actionable multi-omic insights on cancer. In collaboration with these companies, using the predictive models, we will accelerate the search for more effective cancer treatments through biomarker discovery, drug screening, drug repurposing, and ultimately clinical trials with higher probability of success.
 
PEDAL, which incorporates CORE™, our active machine learning program, with tumor profile data and human tumor samples, allows for optimized, high-confidence drug-response predictions within a large experimental space. With each iteration of PEDAL, the program learns, predicts, and then directs the most informative wet lab experimentation, while building the predictive model. This allows for a unique and streamlined approach in which AI-driven predictions are tested against samples from this expansive and diverse biobank to more efficiently and effectively narrow down viable drug-tumor pairings. Our AI-driven platform is powered by a biobank of tumor samples to move molecules forward with a higher probability of success. The focus of our business strategy is to leverage and expand our portfolio of proprietary solutions to advance drug discovery and enable oncology drug development for our biopharma partners.

Clinical Testing
 
Via our Helomics subsidiary, we offer a group of clinically relevant, cancer-related tumor profiling and biomarker tests for gynecological cancers that determine how likely the patient is to respond to various types of available chemotherapy treatments and which therapies might be indicated by relevant tumor biomarkers.
Clinic diagnostic testing is comprised of our Tumor Drug Response Testing (ChemoFx™) and Genomic Profiling (BioSpeciFx) tests. The Tumor Drug Response Testing test determines how a patient’s tumor specimen reacts to a panel of various chemotherapy drugs, while the Genomic Profiling test evaluates the expression and/or status of a particular gene related to a patient’s tumor specimen.
 
Testing involves obtaining tumor tissue during biopsy or surgery which is then sent to our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified laboratory using a special collection kit. Tumor Drug Response Testing is a fresh tissue platform that uses the patient’s own live tumor cells to help physicians identify effective treatment options for each gynecologic cancer patient.
 
Genomic Profiling offers a select group of clinically relevant protein expression and genetic mutation tests associated with drug response and disease prognosis. Physicians can select biomarkers for testing from carefully chosen panels of relevant tests, intuitively organized by cancer pathway and tumor type. Results for these tests are presented in a clear, easy to understand format, including summaries of the clinical relevance of each marker.
 
zPREDICTA 
 
zPREDICTA develops tumor-specific in vitro models for oncology drug discovery and research by biopharmaceutical companies and other clients and partners. zPREDICTA’s 3D product models accelerate the drug development process for its clients and partners by leveraging the expertise in carcinogenesis, metastasis and the tumor microenvironment. It develops complex in vitro models that recapitulate the physiological environment of human tissue.
 
zPREDICTA models provides drug response prediction with high correlation to clinical response, enabling our biopharma clients to manage pipeline prioritization more efficiently by identifying drugs that are effective in patients, from the hundreds, and often thousands, of compounds in development. The tumor-specific models are used by a number of biopharmaceutical companies to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of their therapeutic pipelines. Our models replicate the extracellular matrix of individual organs and disease-specific soluble microenvironment mimicking the biology of human disease and matching thein vivo milieu of the organ of interest, and as such, demonstrate high correlation with clinical response.
 
The zPREDICTA 3D tumor-specific models incorporate tissue-specific extracellular matrices and tumor-specific medium supplements allowing for a true reconstruction of tumor microenvironment. Our approach is compatible with multiple classes of immuno-oncology agents from naked antibody and antibody-drug conjugates, to bi- and tri-specific compounds, and CAR-T cells. The organ-specific disease models provide 3D reconstruction of human tissues accurately representing each disease state and mimicking drug response.
 
Our platform maintains tumor-tumor and tumor-stroma interactions and incorporates both cellular and extracellular elements of tissue microenvironment including soluble factors in an organ- and disease-specific manner. It is compatible with multiple cell types, drug classes, and downstream analysis methods.
 
Our platform is designed to evaluate drug candidates and drug combinations within the native microenvironment of human tissues. Our technology is a patient-derived 3D culture platform that recreates the complex human organ microenvironment thereby preserving the critical interactions between a tumor and its surroundings. Our platform supports long-term survival and proliferation of malignant and non-malignant cellular components of tissues. This includes tumor cells, stroma, and immune components. Anticancer compounds tested in our models exhibit high correlation with clinical response when comparing treatment outcomes in the clinic with cellular behavior in response to the therapeutic regimen. Our organ-specific technology is compatible with multiple drug classes, including small molecules, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunomodulatory agents, CAR-T cells, etc. Our platform is fully customizable to the tumor and tissue of interest. It is compatible with multiple cell types, drug classes, and downstream analysis methods.
 
    6 

  

Applications include providing efficacy screening of anticancer compounds, evaluation of mechanisms of drug resistance, identification of new drug combinations, rescue of failed drug candidates, assessment of off-target toxicity, target discovery and biomarker discovery. Product offerings include preclinical testing services based on our proprietary models directly to clients in the biopharmaceutical industry. As of December 31, 2022, we have merged our zPREDICTA entity with Predictive Oncology and moved all related laboratory operations to our CLIA laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
 
SOLUBLE BIOTECH
 
Our Soluble Biotech business (“Soluble”) focuses on contract services and research for biopharmaceutical company clients and academic collaborators, focused on solubility improvements, stability studies, and protein production. Specifically, Soluble provides optimized FDA-approved formulations for vaccines, antibodies, and other protein therapeutics in a faster and lower cost basis to its customers. In addition, Soluble enables protein degradation studies, which based on current projections, could be a substantial line of business for the Company.
 
The primary assets of Soluble are our automated High Throughput Self-Interaction Chromatography (“HSC”™). HSC is a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens on excipients previously approved by the FDA for protein formulations. Our technology measures second virial coefficient (B22 value) of protein-protein interactions to identify excipients that promote protein solubility in solutions. The data generated from HSC screens are analyzed by a proprietary AI predictive algorithm to identify the optimal combination(s) of buffers, pH, and excipients, resulting in increased solubility and physical stability of proteins. Several of our clients have seen ten-fold and hundred-fold increases in their protein’s solubility while maintaining physical stability. For biopharmaceutical clients this means faster development times and quicker progression of molecules into the clinic. For academic collaborators, this means further progression of biochemical & biology studies necessary to advance fundamental research in areas of unmet medical need.
 
In addition, Soluble provides comprehensive protein stability analysis. Analysis via time-dependent shelf-life studies and forced degradation studies designed to quickly determine which of the previously FDA approved additives will improve the solubility and stability of proteins in solutions. Services include pre-formulation development, stability assessment, and biophysical characterization which evaluate variables including pH, temperature, humidity, light, oxidizing agents, and mechanical stress to determine the most promising additives, formulation of B22 values and confirmation on conformation stability. We provide clients with a list of the most promising additives from a set of over 40 different additives that can increase the solubility and stability of protein formulations.
 
Soluble also offers protein solubility kits that allow rapid identification of soluble formulations. We provide four different kits to fulfill customer solubility requirements. The kits are in 96-well format and provide the tools and methods to compare relative solubility across 88 common formulations (with 8 controls). Soluble kits utilize a simple mix and spin protocol that quickly evaluates aggregation behavior as a function of pH, salt, and additives costing significantly less than if manually determined.
 
In addition, Soluble supplies proprietary technologies for bacterial endotoxin detection and removal. Endotoxin is an inherent byproduct of bacterial expression of therapeutic proteins. However, therapeutic proteins are required to have extremely low endotoxin levels. Soluble provides a product to remove endotoxin that works through multiple molecular interactions for efficient removal over a wide range of buffer conditions with minimal product loss. The detection of endotoxin can also be adversely affected by the protein therapeutic itself. To address this, Soluble provides sample treatment kits to minimize detection interference while using standard detection assays. At the Soluble GMP facility, we are able to manufacture high-quality endotoxin detection and removal products to help our customers efficiently meet safety standards. We follow GMP, ICH and GLP standards throughout to ensure consistent and standardized products and services. As of December 31, 2022, we have merged Soluble Biotech Inc. with Predictive Oncology.
 
SKYLINE MEDICAL – The STREAMWAY System
 
Sold through our subsidiary, Skyline Medical Inc. (“Skyline Medical”), the STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates exposure to blood, irrigation fluid, and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment.

Industry and Market Background and Analysis 
 
Drug Discovery Solutions 
 
The growing demand for the discovery and development of novel drug therapies are driving the demand for AI empowered solutions in the drug discovery processes. Growing partnerships and cooperation are expected to fuel global market for AI in drug discovery. The adoption of AI solutions in the drug development process eliminates possible obstacles, reduces cycle time, and increases the productivity and accuracy of the clinical trial process. Due to these advantages, the importance of AI in drug discovery and development are expected to drive the global market. AI powered drug discovery market is an emerging approach that considers individual variability in multi-omics, including genes, disease and environment to develop effective therapies. This approach predicts more accurately which treatment, dose, and therapeutic regimen could provide the best possible outcome. Biopharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations, academia, and other stakeholders began integrating AI-based solutions in their drug development processes to enhance outcomes and curb costs. Through the implementation of AI solutions, the screening processes can be accelerated, and the turnaround time can be reduced.
 
We believe we are uniquely positioned with our PEDAL platform to provide early insights that clients can use to prioritize drugs for development and identify biomarker-informed indications. In addition, the PEDAL platform can be used to re-purpose previously failed drug compounds. We aim to leverage the PEDAL platform for our biopharma clients and help them use it to decide early on which drugs to prioritize for development and which to discontinue. This will allow a biopharma client to be able to predict what are the drugs that they should be moving into development. With our technology, we want to change the way that biopharma companies plan clinical trials and develop oncology drugs. We believe our platform provides money- and time-saving advantages for pharmaceutical companies that are unique in the marketplace.
 
We believe the passage of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 will increase the use of non-animal methods to study the mechanisms of diseases and to test the effectiveness of new drugs. The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 eliminates animal-testing requirements for the development of drugs and allows drug manufacturers to opt out of animal testing while utilizing modern testing methods to develop drugs, such as cell-based assays, organ-on-a-chip technology, computer models, and other human biology-based test methods. We expect the market to continue to grow due to the benefits from the elimination of possible obstacles, reduction of clinical trial cycle time, and increased productivity and accuracy of the clinical trial process probability of clinical success.
 
Infectious and Biohazardous Waste Management
 
There has long been recognition of the collective potential for ill effects to healthcare workers from exposure to infectious/biohazardous materials. Federal and state regulatory agencies have issued mandatory guidelines for the control of such materials, and in particular, bloodborne pathogens. OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) requires employers to adopt engineering and work practice controls that would eliminate or minimize employee exposure from hazards associated with bloodborne pathogens. In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The revised standard clarifies and emphasizes the need for employers to select safer needle devices and to involve employees in identifying and choosing these devices. The revised standard also calls for the use of “automated controls” as it pertains to the minimization of healthcare exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
 
Most surgical procedures produce potentially infectious materials that must be disposed with the lowest possible risk of cross-contamination to healthcare workers. Current standards of care allow for these fluids to be retained in canisters and located in the operating room where they can be monitored throughout the surgical procedure. Once the procedure is complete these canisters and their contents are disposed using a variety of methods, all of which include manual handling and result in a heightened risk to healthcare workers for exposure to their contents. Canisters are the most prevalent means of collecting and disposing of infectious fluids in hospitals today. Traditional, non-powered canisters and related suction and fluid disposable products are exempt and do not require FDA clearance. 
 
    8 

  

We believe that our virtually hands free direct-to-drain technology (1) significantly reduces the risk of healthcare worker exposure to these infectious fluids by replacing canisters, (2) further reduces the risk of worker exposure when compared to powered canister technology that requires transport to and from the operating room, (3) reduces the cost per procedure for handling these fluids, and (4) enhances the surgical team’s ability to collect data to accurately assess the patient’s status during and after procedures. In addition to the traditional canister method of waste fluid disposal, several other powered medical devices have been developed that address some of the deficiencies described above. Most of these competing products continue to utilize some variation on the existing canister technology, and while not directly addressing the canister, most have been successful in eliminating the need for an expensive gel and its associated handling and disposal costs.  Our existing competitors with products already on the market have a clear competitive advantage over us in terms of brand recognition and market exposure. In addition, many of our competitors have extensive marketing and development budgets that could overpower an emerging growth company like ours.
 
We expect the hospital surgery market to continue to increase due to population growth, the aging of the population, and expansion of surgical procedures to new areas (for example, use of the endoscope) which requires more fluid management and new medical technology.
 
STREAMWAY System Product Sales
 
Our Skyline Medical division consists primarily of sales of the STREAMWAY System, as well as sales of the proprietary cleaning fluid and filters for use with the STREAMWAY System. We manufacture an environmentally conscious system for the collection and disposal of infectious fluids resulting from surgical and other medical procedures. We have been granted patents for the STREAMWAY System in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We distribute our products to medical facilities where bodily and irrigation fluids produced during medical procedures must be contained, measured, documented, and disposed. Our products minimize the exposure potential to the healthcare workers who handle such fluids.
 
The STREAMWAY System is a wall-mounted fully automated system that disposes of an unlimited amount of suction fluid providing uninterrupted performance for physicians while virtually eliminating healthcare workers’ exposure to potentially infectious fluids collected during surgical and other patient procedures. We also manufacture and sell two disposable products required for the operation of the STREAMWAY System: a bifurcated dual port procedure filter with tissue trap and a single use bottle of cleaning solution. Both items are utilized on a single procedure basis and must be discarded after use. The STREAMWAY disposables are a critical component of our business model. Recurring revenues from the sale of the disposables are expected to be significantly higher over time than the revenues from the initial sale of the unit. We have exclusive distribution rights to the disposable solution.
 
Competition and Competitive Advantages
 
Drug Discovery Solutions. New drug compounds take 10-12 years to become medicines, from discovery to commercial launch. Identifying those medicines is a difficult process with a significant majority of compounds failing. This failure is costly in time and resources, particularly when the compounds fail during the clinical trial stages. It is estimated that 90-95% of compounds fail between first human dose and launch. One of the reasons for this high failure rate is the inability of oncology drug compounds to be tested in a large, diverse group of tumor samples.
 
    9 

  

AI companies addressing the needs in the drug discovery market are looking at the challenges from different angles. However, no other company has access to a privately held biobank with drug response data. The ability to pair AI with Predictive Oncology’s biobank provides us with a competitive advantage and barrier to entry from competitors in the drug response prediction space informed by tumor samples that can be tested in a laboratory.
 
We believe this patient-centric, highly standardized, and curated, multi-omic tumor model offers a better chance of generating serviceable predictive models of drug-response and outcomes than competitive approaches in the market today. The information embodied in the AI-driven predictive model provides insights into each tumor’s response to different therapeutic options, resulting in the ability to provide actionable insights critical to both new drug development and individualizing patient treatment and drug repurposing.
 
3D Modeling. Our next-generation technology based on extensive research of the human tumor microenvironment creating accurate reconstruction of the organ-specific 3D tissue microenvironment enabling evaluation of therapeutic agents under conditions mimicking human physiology. The main competitive advantage of our technology is the tumor-specific nature of its systems. 3D models replicate tissue heterogeneity and provides long-term maintenance of primary human cells, organoids, and cell lines under the native conditions of human disease. The 3D models are formulated to mimic the tissue and disease of interest instead of pursuing a one-size-fits-all approach taken by other companies. Services provide reliable prediction of clinical outcomes based on accurate reconstruction of cellular and extracellular compartments of human tissues.
Formulations and Biologic Development. HSC Technology is a self-contained, automated system that conducts high-throughput, self-interaction chromatography screens on FDA approved excipients for protein formulations. This provides an efficient way of exploring over 4,000 formulation combinations to quickly move the molecule along the development continuum. The HSC Instrument and its technology has been validated over the past twelve years via industry and academic collaborations. The data generated from HSC screens are analyzed by a proprietary predictive algorithm to identify the optimal combination(s) of buffers, pH, and excipients, resulting in increased solubility and physical stability of proteins. Several of our clients have seen ten-fold and hundred-fold increases in their protein’s solubility while maintaining physical stability. For biopharmaceutical clients this means faster development times and quicker progression of molecules into the clinic. Our technologies and services help expedite and streamline biologics development—improving yield with expression and purification services; helping prepare for clinical trials with ICH stability profiles; meeting safety standards with endotoxin detection and removal; and manufacturing at our GMP facility.
Skyline Medical. We believe that the STREAMWAY System is unique to the industry because it allows continuous suction but also provides for unlimited capacity, eliminating the need to interrupt a procedure to change canisters. To our knowledge, the STREAMWAY System is the only known fully automated fully closed direct‐to‐drain system that is wall‐mounted and able to collect, measure, and dispose of an unlimited amount of waste fluid without interruption.
Suppliers
 
We buy our raw materials from several suppliers and, except as set forth below, the loss of any one supplier would not materially adversely affect our business. We rely on sole suppliers for certain materials used to perform our molecular diagnostic tests. We also purchase reagents used in our molecular diagnostic tests from sole-source suppliers. While we have developed alternate sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain that these strategies will be effective or that the alternative sources will be available in a timely manner. If our current suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials that we need to perform molecular diagnostic tests, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, there could be an interruption in molecular diagnostic test processing. In the event of the loss of these suppliers, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business.
 
We also have single suppliers for the manufacturing of certain of our Skyline Medical products. Alternative suppliers are available in the market; however, we could experience delays and interruptions that might adversely affect the financial performance of our business including time for machine tooling specific to our products.

Research and Development (“R&D”)
 
We spent $320,320 and $315,850 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, on R&D. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret intellectual property rights, and other measures to protect our intellectual property to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies if a breach were to occur.
 
3D. Our technology is a patient-derived 3D culture platform that recreates the complex human organ microenvironment thereby preserving the critical interactions between a tumor and its surroundings. Our models replicate the extracellular matrix of individual organs and disease-specific soluble microenvironment mimicking the biology of human disease, and as such, demonstrate high correlation with clinical response. Patents include US10,501,717, US11,124,756 and pending application US16/321,277.

The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health requires 510(k) submitters to provide information that compares its new device to a marketed device of a similar type, in order to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent.
 
We filed the 510(k) submission for clearance of the STREAMWAY System device on March 14, 2009 and received written confirmation on April 1, 2009 that our 510(k) has been cleared by the FDA.
 
Following these 510(k) clearances by the FDA, we continue to be subject to the normal ongoing audits and reviews by the FDA and other governing agencies. These audits and reviews are standard and typical in the medical device industry, and we do not anticipate being affected by any extraordinary guidelines or regulations.
 
Our subsidiary, Skyline Medical has successfully passed FDA audits in the past, with no observations or 483 warning letters issued.
 
Application for Electrical Safety Testing and Certification for STREAMWAY System
 
We sought and achieved testing and certification to the IEC 60606-1 and IEC 60606-1-2, two internationally recognized standards.
 
The 60601-1 3rd edition certification for our STREAMWAY System is valid and enables us to continue to market and sell our product domestically and internationally.
 
We have contracted with TUV, a nationally recognized testing laboratory-NRTL, to certify our STREAMWAY System to the new 60601-1 3rd Edition in late 2016. We attained certification to the new standard, and then submitted it to our Notified Body (BSI) for recommendation for our CE Mark, which we received in June 2017, allowing us to sell products outside of the United States.
 
Effective November 21, 2016, we received a Medical Device Establishment License to sell the STREAMWAY System and related disposables in Canada.
 
ISO Certification
 
Our subsidiary, Skyline Medical, hired BSI (British Standards Institute) to be its Notified Body and to perform audits to ISO 13485:2003 Standards. On June 1, 2016, we successfully passed the audit of our Quality Management System and received our Certificate of Registration for ISO 13485:2016. Our certificate number is FM 649810.
