ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Mi1 Global Telco., Inc. (the “Company”), formerly known as Domain Extremes Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2006 and is a development stage company. Our business was to develop and operate Internet websites and applications on mobile platforms. We had launched the website www.drinkeat.com, which provided reviews of restaurants in Hong Kong. On May 25, 2018, the Company ceased and discontinued the operations by terminating its website and is exploring other business opportunities in Asia. Our goal is to become a major network of consumer-based websites and applications targeting viewers in the Hong Kong and Greater China with contents on travel, food, entertainment, activities and city life.
 
We are a controlled corporation with the substantial majority of our shares held by Mi1 Global Limited (“Mi1”), a company registered in the Republic of Vanuatu. Mi1 acquired a 51% stake in our company in February 2016. As a result, there can be no assurance that our business and/or our strategy will not change over time as a result of Mi1’s interest.
 
On May 1, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada changing the Company’s name from Domain Extremes Inc. to Mi1 Global Telco., Inc. and the authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001, from 200,000,000 shares to 1,200,000,000 shares. The name change became effective with FINRA on July 19, 2017.
 
Beginning on July 19, 2017, the Company’s shares of common stock began trading on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the symbol “MIGT” to reflect the Company’s new name.
 
On August 7, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of change with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effectuate a reverse stock split (the “Stock Split”) of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 1-for-10,000 basis. The number of its authorized shares of common stock remained at 1,200,000,000 shares, par value $0.001. The Stock Split became effective with FINRA on October 24, 2017 (the “Effective Date”).
 
We do not have any subsidiaries. We never have declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceedings.
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of December 31, 2018 had a stockholders deficit of $174,462. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Our Business
 
Currently, we have no active operations.
 
Employees
 
As of October 11, 2019, the Company had no employees.
 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however, we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.
Offices
 
Our principal executive office is located at 36, Jalan Seri Utara 3/3C, Kipark Avenue, Off Jalan Ipoh, 68100 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia. Our telephone number is +603 6241 2023 and +603 6242 1028.
