ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Introduction
 
As used in this report, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, the “Company” and terms such as “we,” “us” “our,” and “AIRI” refer to Air Industries Group, a Nevada corporation, and its directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
We are an aerospace and defense company. We manufacture and design structural parts and assemblies that focus on flight safety, including landing gear, arresting gear, engine mounts, flight controls, throttle quadrants, components for jet engines and other components. Our products are currently deployed on a wide range of high profile military and commercial aircraft including Sikorsky’s UH-60 Black Hawk, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Northrop Grumman’s E2 Hawkeye, Boeing’s 777, Airbus’ 380 commercial airliners, the US Navy F-18 and USAF F-16 fighter aircraft. Our Turbine Engine sector makes components for jet engines that are used on the USAF F-15, the Airbus A-330 and A-380, and the Boeing 777, in addition to a number of ground turbine applications.
 
We became a public company in 2005 when our net sales were approximately $30 million. Air Industries Machining, Corp. (“AIM”), our principal subsidiary, has manufactured components and subassemblies for the defense and commercial aerospace industry for over 50 years and has established long-term relationships with leading defense and aerospace manufacturers
 
In response to recent operating losses and their impact on our working capital, we have repositioned our business through the sale and liquidation of certain businesses we acquired since becoming a public company. We also consolidated our headquarters and the operations of our subsidiaries, Air Industries Machining and Nassau Tool Works, at our corporate campus in Bay Shore, New York, allowing us to re-focus our operations on our core competencies.
 
On December 20, 2018, we completed the sale of all of the outstanding shares of our subsidiary, Welding Metallurgy, Inc., which included our subsidiaries Miller Stuart, Woodbine, Decimal and Compac Development Corp. (collectively, the “WMI Group”), to CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (“CPI”) for a purchase price of $9,000,000, net of a working capital adjustment of $(1,093,000), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of March 21, 2018. On March 19, 2019, we received a notice from CPI claiming that the working capital deficit used to compute the purchase price was understated which we intend to contest.
 
We now conduct our operations through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: Air Industries Machining (“AIM”); Nassau Tool Works (“NTW”); and The Sterling Engineering Corporation (“Sterling”). AIM and NTW comprise our Complex Machining segment and Sterling represents our Turbine Engine Components segment.
 
In addition to repositioning our business to obtain profitability and positive cash flow, we remain resolute on meeting customers’ needs and have and continue to align production schedules to meet the needs of customers. We believe that an unyielding focus on our customers will allow us to execute on our existing backlog in a timely fashion and take on additional commitments. We are pleased with our progress and the positive responses received from our customers.

Our Market
 
We operate primarily in the military and, to a lesser degree, commercial aviation industries. Defense revenues represent a preponderance of our sales. Our principal customers include Sikorsky Aircraft, Goodrich Landing Gear Systems, Northrop Grumman, the United States Department of Defense, GKN Aerospace, Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, Piper Aircraft, M7 Aerospace, Vought Aerospace, Ametek/Hughes-Treitler and Airbus.
 
Our products are incorporated into many aircraft platforms, the majority of which remain in production, and of which there are a substantial number of operating aircraft in fleets maintained by the military and commercial airlines. We believe that we are the largest supplier of flight critical parts to Sikorsky’s Black Hawk helicopter. We have made, or currently make, or have been awarded, products for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Northrop Grumman’s E2 Hawkeye, Boeing’s 777, Airbus’ 380 commercial airliners, and the US Navy F-18 and USAF F-16 fighter aircraft. Our Turbine Engine Components segment makes components for jet engines that are used on the USAF F-15, the Airbus A-330 and A-380, and the Boeing 777, in addition to a number of non-military ground turbine applications.
 
Many of our products are “flight critical,” essential to aircraft performance and safety on takeoff, during flight and when landing. These products require advanced certifications as a condition to being a supplier. For many of our products we are the sole or one of a limited number of sources of supply. Many of the parts we supply are subject to wear and tear or fatigue and are routinely replaced on aircraft on a time in service or flight cycle basis. Replacement demand for these products will continue, albeit at perhaps a lower rate, so long as an aircraft remains in service, which is usually many years after production has stopped.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our approach to sales and marketing can be best understood through the concept of customer alignment. The aerospace industry is dominated by a small number of large prime contractors and equipment manufacturers. These customers rely heavily upon subcontractors to supply quality parts meeting specifications on a timely and cost effective basis. These customers and other customers we supply routinely rate their suppliers based on a variety of performance factors. One of our principal goals is to be highly rated and thus relied upon by all of our customers.
 
The large prime contractors are increasingly seeking subcontractors who can supply and are qualified to integrate the fabrication of larger, more complex and more complete subassemblies. We seek to position ourselves within the supply chain of these contractors and manufacturers to be selected for subcontracted projects. Successful positioning requires that we qualify to be a preferred supplier by achieving and maintaining independent third party quality approval certifications, specific customer quality system approvals and top supplier ratings through strong performance on existing contracts.
 
During our sales and marketing efforts we let customers know that we have employees with the talent and experience to manage the manufacture of sections of aircraft structures to be delivered to the final assembly phase of the aircraft manufacturing cycle, and customers have now engaged us for these services.
 
Initial contracts are usually obtained through competitive bidding against other qualified subcontractors, while follow-on contracts are usually retained by successfully performing initial contracts. Our long term business generally benefits from barriers to entry resulting from investments, certifications, familiarization with the needs and systems of customers, and manufacturing techniques developed during the initial manufacturing phase. We endeavor to develop each of our relationships to one of a “partnership” where we participate in the resolution of pre-production design and build issues, and initial contracts are obtained as single source awards and follow-on pricing is determined through negotiations.

Our Backlog
 
The production cycle of products we manufacture can extend from several months to a year or longer. This gives rise to significant backlogs as customers must order product with sufficient lead time to ensure timely delivery.
 
We have a number of long-term multi-year General Purchase Agreements or GPA’s with several of our customers. These agreements specify part numbers, specifications and prices of the covered products for an agreed upon period, but do not authorize immediate production and shipment. Shipments are authorized periodically by the customer to fit its production schedule. In late 2017, we received a renewal of our multi-year contract with Sikorsky, MY9, for the years 2018 to 2023. This contract is for $47 million worth of product during this period. This is the third multi-year contract award we have received from Sikorsky.
 
Our “firm backlog” includes only fully authorized orders received for products to be delivered within the forward 18-month period. As of February 28, 2019, our 18-month “firm funded backlog” was approximately $92.4 million.
 
Competition
 
Winning a new contract is highly competitive. We manufacture to customer design specifications, and we compete against companies that have similar manufacturing capabilities in a global marketplace. Consequently, the ability to obtain contracts requires providing quality products at competitive prices. To accomplish this requires that we strive for continuous improvement in our capabilities to assure our competitiveness and provide value to our customers. Our marketing strategy involves developing long-term ongoing working relationships with customers. These relationships enable us to develop entry barriers to would-be competitors by establishing and maintaining advanced quality approvals, certifications and tooling investments that are difficult and expensive to duplicate. Many of our competitors are well-established subcontractors engaged in the supply of aircraft parts and components to prime military contractors and commercial aviation manufacturers. Among our competitors are: Monitor Aerospace, a division of Stellex Aerospace; Hydromil, a division of Triumph Aerospace Group; Heroux Aerospace and Ellanef Manufacturing, a division of Magellan Corporation.
 
Many of our competitors are larger enterprises or divisions of significantly larger companies having greater financial, physical and technical resources, and the capabilities to timelier respond under much larger contracts.
 
Raw Materials and Replacement Parts
 
The manufacturing process for certain products, particularly those for which we serve as product integrator, requires significant purchases of raw materials, hardware and subcontracted details. As a result, much of our success in profitably meeting customer demand for these products requires efficient and effective subcontract management. Price and availability of many raw materials utilized in the aerospace industry are subject to volatile global markets and political conditions. Most suppliers of raw materials are unwilling to commit to long-term contracts at fixed prices. This is a substantial risk as our strategy often involves long term fixed price commitments to our customers. Recently, we have had difficulties in securing timely shipments of raw materials and components from certain vendors due to our liquidity problems. 
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2019 we employed approximately 209 people. Of these, approximately 32 were in administration, 3 were in sales and procurement, and 174 were in manufacturing.
 
Air Industries Machining is a party to a collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”) with the United Service Workers, IUJAT, Local 355 (the “Union”) with which we believe we maintain good relations. The Agreement was renewed as of December 31, 2018 and expires on December 31, 2021 and covers all of AIM’s production personnel, of which there are approximately 107 people. In light of the continuing consolidation and integration of NTW business with AIM, we intend to add more employees to the Union during 2019. AIM is required to make a monthly contribution to each of the Union’s United Welfare Fund and the United Services Worker’s Security Fund. This is the only pension benefit required by the Agreement and the Company is not obligated for any future defined benefit to retirees. The Agreement contains a “no-strike” clause, whereby, during the term of the Agreement, the Union will not strike and AIM will not lockout its employees.

All of our employees are covered under a co-employment agreement with Extensis, Inc., a professional employer organization that provides out-sourced human resource services.
 
Regulations 
 
Environmental Regulation; Employee Safety
 
We are subject to regulations administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, various state agencies and county and local authorities acting in cooperation with federal and state authorities. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions that require us to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous chemicals and substances. The extensive regulatory framework imposes compliance burdens and financial and operating risks on us. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil and criminal fines in the case of violations.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on the present and former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. New York and Connecticut, the states where our production facilities are located, also have stringent laws and regulations governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, counterparts of CERCLA and RCRA. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which requires employers to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, obligates employers to provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances.
 
Federal Aviation Administration
 
We are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have never been subject to such fines or disqualifications.
Government Contract Compliance
 
Our government contracts and those of many of our customers are subject to the procurement rules and regulations of the United States government, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Many of the contract terms are dictated by these rules and regulations. During and after the fulfillment of a government contract, we may be audited in respect of the direct and allocated indirect costs attributed to the project. These audits may result in adjustments to our contract costs. Additionally, we may be subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations because of our participation in government procurement. Any inquiry or investigation can result in fines or limitations on our ability to continue to bid for government contracts and fulfill existing contracts.
 
We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits required for the operation of our business.
