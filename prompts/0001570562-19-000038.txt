Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a performance beauty company with a customer-centric approach focused on delivering breakthrough products in the self-pay aesthetic market. On February 1, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our first product Jeuveau™ (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs). We plan to launch Jeuveau™ commercially in the United States in Spring 2019. Jeuveau™ is a proprietary 900 kDa purified botulinum toxin type A formulation indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines, also known as “frown lines,” in adults. We believe we will offer physicians and consumers a compelling value proposition with Jeuveau™. Currently, onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) is the neurotoxin market leader, and prior to the approval of Jeuveau™, was the only known 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex approved in the United States. We believe aesthetic physicians generally prefer the performance characteristics of the complete 900 kDa neurotoxin complex and are accustomed to injecting this formulation. 
We have successfully completed a comprehensive global five-study clinical development program which we named TRANSPARENCY. The TRANSPARENCY global clinical program included studies in the United States, EU and Canada to meet the regulatory requirements for a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the United States, a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the European Union, or EU, and a New Drug Submission, or NDS, in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines between the eyebrows. The program, which was developed in consultation with the FDA, Canadian and European regulatory bodies, included three multicenter, randomized, controlled, single dose Phase III studies and two open label, multiple dose, long-term Phase II studies. Over 2,100 adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown participated in the TRANSPARENCY program. All three Phase III studies in the TRANSPARENCY program successfully met their respective primary endpoints. 
We submitted a New Drug Submission, or NDS, to Health Canada and in August 2018 we received approval from Health Canada for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adult patients under 65 years of age. We plan to market the product in Canada in the first half of 2019 through our distribution partner Clarion Medical Technologies, Inc., or Clarion, a Canadian provider of medical and aesthetic equipment and consumables to hospitals, aesthetic clinics and private medical practices. We also submitted an MAA to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and it was accepted for review in July 2017. We expect an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in the first quarter of 2019. If the CHMP provides a favorable opinion, we would expect approval of our MAA by end of second quarter 2019. 
Our primary market is the self-pay aesthetic market, which includes medical products purchased by physicians that are then sold to consumers or used in procedures for aesthetic indications that are not reimbursed by any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. Within the self-pay aesthetic market, the global aesthetic neurotoxin market was estimated to generate approximately $2.5 billion of revenue in 2018 and is estimated to grow to approximately $3.5 billion in 2021. The United States is the largest portion of this market and was estimated to generate approximately $1.2 billion of revenue in 2018 and is expected to grow to approximately $1.7 billion in 2021. We believe the aesthetic neurotoxin markets is one of the most attractive in healthcare with secular growth trends. We believe the continued growth of the aesthetic neurotoxin market will be driven by an aging population, increased use by individuals between the ages of 19 and 34, whom we refer to as millennials, increasing life expectancy, rising disposable income, improved accessibility to these products and treatments due to an increase in the number of physicians who perform these procedures, continued innovation, and an increasing acceptance and utilization of elective or minimally invasive aesthetic procedures. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, aesthetic neurotoxin treatments are the number one cosmetic procedure being considered by millennials, and neurotoxin use among this group has increased by 87% between 2011 and 2016. 
Jeuveau™ is the first known neurotoxin dedicated exclusively to aesthetics. We plan to launch Jeuveau™ in the United States in Spring 2019 by building a commercialization infrastructure, which includes our own specialty sales force of approximately 140 sales representatives. We intend to create a strongly desirable experience for physicians and consumers by leveraging our management team’s extensive industry experience, our compelling head-to-head clinical data compared with BOTOX, and our unique technology platform designed to transform the aesthetic market by eliminating the friction points existing for customers today. Outside of the United States, we plan to market and sell our neurotoxin through distributors in the territories in which we have the right to sell it.
On September 30, 2013, we entered into a license and supply agreement, or the Daewoong Agreement, pursuant to which we have an exclusive distribution license to Jeuveau™ from Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or Daewoong, a South 
3

Korean pharmaceutical manufacturer, for aesthetic indications in the United States, EU, Canada, Australia, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States, or C.I.S., and South Africa, as well as co-exclusive distribution rights with Daewoong in Japan. Jeuveau™ will be manufactured by Daewoong in a recently constructed facility in South Korea. We also have the option to negotiate first with Daewoong to secure a distribution license for any product that Daewoong directly or indirectly develops or commercializes that is classified as an injectable botulinum toxin (other than Jeuveau™) in a territory covered by the license. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe we will offer physicians and consumers a compelling value proposition beginning with the launch of Jeuveau™ for the following reasons:

• | Jeuveau™ will offer the U.S. market the first known 900 kDa neurotoxin alternative to BOTOX. The manufacture of both Jeuveau™ and BOTOX starts with a 900 kDa complex, includes adding the excipients human serum albumin, or HSA, and sodium chloride, and finishes by vacuum drying. We believe Jeuveau™ is the only known neurotoxin product in the United States with a 900 kDa neurotoxin complex other than BOTOX. We also believe an important component of competitiveness in the neurotoxin market relates to the characteristics associated with the 900 kDa complex and the potential of the accessory proteins to increase the effectiveness of the active toxin portion of the complex.


• | Results from our TRANSPARENCY global clinical program in more than 2,100 patients provides robust data to physicians evaluating the purchase of Jeuveau™. We believe the comprehensive TRANSPARENCY clinical data set, including a head-to-head Phase III study comparing Jeuveau™ and BOTOX, provides physicians with confidence in recommending Jeuveau™ to their patients. 


• | Enhanced level of physician-customer interaction through a self-pay, aesthetic-only marketing strategy. We have elected to specifically target the self-pay aesthetic market. With a reduced regulatory burden compared to third-party payor reimbursed therapeutic products, we believe we will achieve a number of benefits that market participants in reimbursed markets are unable to achieve, such as an enhanced level of interaction with our physician-customers. Jeuveau™ is the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication. We believe pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy will create meaningful strategic advantages in the United States, including pricing and marketing flexibility. We intend to utilize this flexibility to drive market adoption through programs such as promotional events, experience product programs and pricing strategies.


• | We are building a unique technology platform. We intend to create a simple, personal and connected experience for physicians utilizing our proprietary technology platform. We are designing a platform with the goal of limiting friction and enhancing the overall experience for physicians and ultimately consumers.


• | We have strong relationships with aesthetic key opinion leaders, or KOLs. We have established relationships with aesthetic KOLs as a result of our management team’s industry experience and engagement of our clinical trial investigators. KOLs are important information resources to the general physician-customer market due to their clinical expertise, academic reputations, active clinical practices and their status as medical innovators. The broader physician community often looks to KOLs for their experience with products and procedures as part of their new product and procedure adoption process.


• | Our management team has significant experience and expertise in medical aesthetics. Our management team has extensive experience in self-pay healthcare markets, in the development, market launch and commercialization of major medical products, execution and integration of business development transactions, identification of and partnerships with KOLs, and understanding of the regulatory environment of the healthcare markets. Key members of our leadership team have also served in relevant senior leadership positions with leading aesthetic companies.

Our Strategy
Our near-term strategy is to enter the U.S. medical aesthetic neurotoxin market with Jeuveau™. We plan to expand our product offerings over time through in-licensing, partnerships and acquisitions. The key components of our strategy are:

• | Launch Jeuveau™ in the United States with our own specialty sales force of approximately 140 sales representatives.

4


• | Partner outside of the United States to reach and serve physicians and consumers in those territories.


• | Pursue an aesthetic-only strategy to enhance marketing and pricing flexibility along with improving transparency for our customers.


• | Leverage our strong KOL relationships to assist in scientific presentations, publications, and other methods to drive success of our commercial launch of Jeuveau™.


• | Establish a leading medical aesthetics company by in-licensing technology, developing partnerships and potentially acquiring products.

Our Market 
Our primary market is self-pay aesthetic healthcare, which includes medical products purchased by physicians that are then sold to consumers or used in procedures for aesthetic indications that are not reimbursed by any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. By focusing on the self-pay medical aesthetics market, we believe we will not be exposed to reimbursement risk associated with a reliance on payments from such third-party payors, and we will be subject to fewer regulations that place limits on the types of marketing and other interactions we can have with physicians. 
Within the self-pay aesthetic market, the global aesthetic neurotoxin market was estimated to generate approximately $2.5 billion of revenue in 2018 and is estimated to grow to approximately $3.5 billion in 2021. The U.S. aesthetic neurotoxin market was estimated to generate $1.2 billion in sales in 2018. 
Within the multiple age groups that receive aesthetic neurotoxin treatments, we will strategically focus our marketing efforts on the Millennial segment which is the largest cohort in the U.S. population. In 2019 there are estimated to be approximately 73 million Millennials, defined as individuals born between 1981 and 1996. Botulinum toxin use among individuals between the age of 19 and 34 increased 87% between 2011 and 2016, and neurotoxin treatments are the number one cosmetic procedure considered by this generation. Approximately 1.7 million females between the age of 30 and 39, which includes many individuals we define as Millennials, are considering neurotoxins in the next twelve months. 
We believe the growth in the medical aesthetics market is driven by a number of factors, including:  

• | Millennials are increasingly seeking medical aesthetic treatments and utilizing neurotoxins as an entry point for aesthetic procedures due to their minimally invasive nature;


• | an aging population together with an increasing life expectancy, which is resulting in more consumers with a desire for improved appearance and well-being over a longer period of time;


• | rising disposable income, with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting that real disposable income in the United States increased approximately 15% from March 2012 to March 2018;


• | growing awareness, utilization and acceptance of elective or minimally invasive aesthetic procedures; and


• | continued innovation and improved accessibility to these treatments due to an increase in the number of physicians who perform these procedures.

Currently, BOTOX, Dysport and Xeomin represent a majority of the medical aesthetics botulinum toxin type A market. In 2018, BOTOX U.S. unit market share was approximately 75% and generated approximately $907 million of revenue. In the same year, Dysport and Xeomin U.S. unit market share was approximately 19% and 7%, respectively. 
Jeuveau™ Overview
We licensed Jeuveau™ from Daewoong in September 2013 and commenced clinical trials in 2014. Jeuveau™ is an injectable formulation of a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex designed to address the needs of the large and growing facial aesthetics market. We completed the TRANSPARENCY global clinical program to meet the regulatory requirements for a BLA in the United States, a MAA in the EU, and a NDS in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. Our program was developed in consultation with the FDA, Canadian and European regulatory bodies. These regulatory bodies provided guidance and feedback on the critical endpoints and statistical methodology required to develop the safety and efficacy endpoints that would support this indication’s approval.

As demonstrated in the figure below, Jeuveau™ contains a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The active part of the neurotoxin is the 150 kDa component, and the remaining 750 kDA of the complex is made up of accessory proteins that we believe help with the function of the active portion of the toxin. Jeuveau™ has the same mechanism of action as other type A botulinum toxins. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin causes a chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in localized reduction of muscle activity. Botulinum toxin type A specifically blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings leading to denervation and relaxation of the muscle.
Diagram of Botulinum Toxin Type A
The following table provides a summary of the botulinum toxin type A complex composition for Jeuveau™ and available toxins in the United States. 
TRANSPARENCY: Evolus Clinical Development for Glabellar Lines
In 2014, we initiated a comprehensive five-study clinical development program for Jeuveau™, which we named TRANSPARENCY, in the United States, EU and Canada to meet the regulatory requirements for a BLA in the United States, a MAA in the EU, and a NDS in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The TRANSPARENCY program, which was developed in consultation with the FDA, Canadian, and European regulatory bodies, included three multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, single dose Phase III studies titled EV-001, EV-002 and EVB-003. Each Phase III study lasted 150 days. The TRANSPARENCY program also included two open label, multiple dose, long-term Phase II studies titled EV-004 and EV-006, each lasting one year. Between September 2014 and August 2016, over 2,100 adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown participated in this program.
6

In our clinical trials, subjects received intramuscular injections in five target sites in muscles that contribute to the formation of glabellar lines: the midline of the procerus, the inferomedial aspect of each corrugator, and the superior middle aspect of each corrugator. Each of the five target sites was injected with 0.1 milliliters, or mL, for a total of 0.5mL. Subjects assigned (in the open label studies) or randomized (in the controlled studies) to Jeuveau™ received a total of 20 units per treatment, administered as 4 units per 0.1mL and those subjects who were randomized to the placebo group received 0.5mL saline. In our EVB-003 Phase III trial, the only study of the five with both a placebo and active control arm, subjects randomized to the active control received a total of 20 units of BOTOX administered as 4 units per 0.1mL.
All five studies contributed data to the evaluation of efficacy and safety. The table below summarizes our five-study TRANSPARENCY global clinical program.

Phase III U.S. Based Clinical Trials. The two identical U.S. Phase III studies, EV-001 and EV-002, enrolled subjects who were selected from a population of healthy adults, at least 18 years of age, who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown, as independently assessed by the investigator and subject using the 4-point photonumeric Glabellar Line Scale, or GLS, where 0=no lines, 1=mild lines, 2=moderate lines and 3=severe lines. On Day 0, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of either Jeuveau™ or placebo. Subjects were followed for 150 days after treatment.
7

The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. This was a composite endpoint in which a responder was a subject with a 2 point improvement or greater on the GLS from Day 0 to Day 30 at maximum frown, only if independently agreed by both investigator and subject assessment. 
Both studies met the primary endpoint of superiority over placebo. The percentages of responders in the intent to treat population for the composite primary endpoint, a two point or greater score composite improvement, in each of the two controlled single dose studies were:

• | EV-001: 1.2% placebo, 67.5% Jeuveau™, with an absolute difference between the groups of 66.3%, 95% CI (59.0, 72.4)


• | EV-002: 1.3% placebo, 70.4% Jeuveau™, with an absolute difference between the groups of 69.1%, 95% CI (61.5, 75.1)

U.S. Phase III Primary Endpoint - Composite Score ≥ 2 Point GLS Improvement at Maximum Frown on Day 30
Since a two point or greater composite score requires both the investigator and subject to agree simultaneously, studies using this definition generally have a lower responder rate than non-composite studies. Xeomin and Dysport represent two botulinum toxin type A products who also conducted trials using a two point or greater composite responder rate. The Xeomin two point or greater responder rates in their Phase III studies, per FDA labels, were 48% and 60%, and the Dysport rates were 52%, 55% and 60%. Importantly, no comparison across any of the studies can be made. 
U.S. Phase III Primary Endpoint - Components of Composite Score, ≥ 2 Point GLS Improvement at Maximum Frown on Day 30 by Investigator and Subject Assessment
In the EV-001 study, analysis of the secondary endpoints investigated the response at maximum frown beyond Day 30 using a two point composite score. A subject was considered a responder only if a ≥2 point improvement had occurred on the GLS at maximum frown from Day 0, by both investigator and subject assessment:

• | At Day 90 (post hoc), the percentage of responders was 1.3% in the placebo group and 26.5% in the Jeuveau™ group with an absolute difference of 25.2%, p<0.001.


• | At Day 120, the percentage of responders was 1.3% in the placebo group and 8.3% in the Jeuveau™ group with an absolute difference of 7.0%, p=0.023.


• | At Day 150 or early termination, the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 4.6% in the Jeuveau™ group. The absolute difference of 4.6% between the groups remained statistically significant for the composite endpoint, p=0.041. 

A p value, as expressed in the data above, is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance. The smaller the p value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p value is less than or equal to 0.05, the outcome is statistically significant. 
The 2 point composite score results were similar in the EV-002 study to the EV-001 study for the secondary endpoints:

• | At Day 90 (post hoc), the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 25.8% in the Jeuveau™ group with an absolute difference of 25.8%, p<0.001.


• | At Day 120, the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 12.4% in the Jeuveau™ group, with an absolute difference of 12.4%, p<0.001.


• | At Day 150 or early termination, the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 4.6% in the Jeuveau™ group. The absolute difference of 4.6% between the groups remained statistically significant for the composite endpoint, p=0.047.

Additional exploratory efficacy analyses in the EV-001 and EV-002 studies were conducted where Jeuveau™ was investigated for a one point or greater improvement as assessed by either the subject or investigator at various days at maximum frown based on the GLS. Jeuveau™ was compared against a placebo at 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 120 days and 150 days or early termination.

In each of the EV-001 and EV-002 studies, we also assessed as an exploratory endpoint investigator and patient assessments on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, or GAIS. The GAIS is a five-point scale on which an evaluator, the subject or investigator, can determine the aesthetic outcome for the subject from: much improved, improved, no change, worse or much worse. The rate of positive responders, those who were assessed by either the subject or the investigator as much improved or improved, over the course of the study is provided below.

U.S. Phase III studies Exploratory Endpoint - Global Aesthetic Improvement Responders (Much Improved/Improved)
EV-002 Subject - Glabellar Lines at Maximum Frown
In the EV-001 study, the adverse event, or AE, rate was 32.1% in the placebo group and 38.2% in the Jeuveau™ group. Placebo and Jeuveau™ groups were similar in the overall incidence of subjects who experienced one or more AEs. Three Jeuveau™ subjects (3/246, 1.2%) experienced serious adverse events, or SAEs, but none were assessed as study drug related. Placebo and Jeuveau™ groups were also similar in the percentages of subjects who experienced AEs assessed by the investigator as study drug related: 13.1% of placebo subjects and 15.4% of Jeuveau™ subjects. The drug related eyelid and eyebrow ptosis rates, the drooping of an upper eyelid or eyebrow, respectively, in the Jeuveau™ group was 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.
11

In the EV-002 study, the AE rate was 26.9% in the placebo group and 28.5% in the Jeuveau™ group. Placebo and Jeuveau™ groups were similar in the overall incidence of subjects who experienced one or more AEs. Four Jeuveau™ subjects (4/246, 1.6%) experienced a SAE, but none were assessed as study drug related. Placebo and Jeuveau™ groups were also similar in the percentages of subjects who experienced an AE assessed by the investigator as study drug related: 7.7% of placebo subjects and 9.8% of Jeuveau™ subjects. The drug related eyelid and eyebrow ptosis rates in the Jeuveau™ arm were 1.2% and 0.4% respectively. Overall, AEs with an incidence of 1% or greater were headache at 9.3% in the Jeuveau™ groups and 7.6% in the placebo groups and eyelid ptosis at 1% in the Jeuveau™ groups and 0% in the placebo groups.
U.S. Phase III Trials - Adverse Event Rate Summary
Phase III European and Canadian Clinical Trial for Glabellar Lines
The EVB-003 study was the third Phase III safety and efficacy study in the Jeuveau™ clinical development program, and was conducted in Europe and Canada. 540 subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines, or a GLS score of 2 or 3, as assessed by the investigator, were eligible to be enrolled provided that subjects also felt their glabellar lines had an important psychological impact, such as on their mood, anxiety or depressive symptoms. On Day 0, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 5:5:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of 20 units of Jeuveau™, 20 units of BOTOX or placebo. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. A responder was a subject with a GLS score of 0 or 1, as assessed by the investigator at maximum frown. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in the EVB-003 study showed the superiority of Jeuveau™ over placebo, and established non-inferiority of Jeuveau™ to BOTOX. The percentages of responders for the primary efficacy endpoint were:

• | 4.2% in the placebo group, 95% CI (0.0, 9.8);


• | 82.8% in the BOTOX group, 95% CI (78.1, 87.5); and


• | 87.2% in the Jeuveau™ group, 95% CI (83.0, 91.5).

A confidence interval, or CI, is a range of values in which, statistically, there is a specified level of confidence where the result lies. As an example, in the results above for this Phase III study, the results indicate that there is a 95% level of confidence that the responder rate for placebo was between 0.0% and 9.8%, which we express as: 95% CI (0.0, 9.8). 
The absolute differences between the treatment groups were:

• | 83.1% between Jeuveau™ and placebo groups, 95% CI (70.3, 89.4), (p<0.001), indicating Jeuveau™ was superior to placebo; and


• | 4.4% between Jeuveau™ and BOTOX groups, 95% CI (-1.9, 10.8), with non‑inferiority of Jeuveau™ versus BOTOX concluded based on the lower bound of the 95% CI for the absolute difference exceeding -10.0%.

EU Phase III Primary Endpoint - Responder Rates at Maximum Frown on Day 30 (GLS = 0 or 1) by Investigator Assessment | EU Phase III Primary Endpoint - Non-Inferiority, at Maximum Frown on Day 30 by Investigator Assessment

As presented in the table below, within each group, 32.7% of placebo subjects, 41.9% of BOTOX subjects and 37.6% of Jeuveau™ subjects experienced AEs. One placebo subject (1/49, 2.0%), one BOTOX subject (1/246, 0.4%) and three Jeuveau™ subjects (3/245, 1.2%) experienced a total of 11 SAEs and none were assessed as study drug related. The drug related eyelid ptosis rates were 1.6% in the Jeuveau™ arm and 0% in the BOTOX arm and the eyebrow ptosis rates were 0% in the Jeuveau™ arm and 0.4% in the BOTOX arm.
EU and Canadian Phase III Trial - Adverse Event Rate Summary
As presented in the table below, in EVB-003, we also assessed as a secondary endpoint ≥ 1 point improvement GLS at maximum frown for both investigator and patient satisfaction. The investigator assessment at Day 2, the beginning of the study, and at Day 150, at the end of the study, Jeuveau™ is statistically superior to placebo as measured by a one-point improvement on the GLS scale by investigator assessment. We also looked at subject satisfaction on Day 30, and Jeuveau™ was superior to placebo at 91% versus 6% in the placebo arm.

Phase II Repeat Dose Clinical Trial for Glabellar Lines
The primary objective of the Phase II EV-004 study was to demonstrate the safety of Jeuveau™ in adult subjects receiving repeat doses of Jeuveau™ for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. This multi-dose study lasted one year. Subjects were selected from a population of healthy adults at least 18 years of age who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown, as assessed by the investigator. On Day 0, eligible subjects were administered a single treatment, 20 units of Jeuveau™. On and after Day 90, subjects were eligible for a repeat treatment if their GLS score was 2 or greater at maximum frown, as assessed by the investigator. If a subject did not have a GLS score of 2 or greater, they were followed monthly until eligible for a repeat treatment or until the study ended on Day 365. The test product in this study was different from all the other Evolus sponsored studies because each vial contained lyophilized, instead of vacuum dried, Jeuveau™. See the section entitled “Additional Safety Evaluations” below for additional information. All other studies in the Evolus sponsored program used vials containing vacuum dried Jeuveau™. Over the course of the one year study, the 352 subjects in the study received a median total dose of 60 units, or 3 treatments. 
Total AEs

• | 148 subjects (148/352, 42.0%) experienced a total of 265 AEs.


• | 7 subjects (7/352, 2.0%) experienced a total of 9 SAEs, none assessed as study drug related.

Study Drug Related AEs

• | 51 subjects (51/352, 14.5%) experienced a total of 59 AEs (59/265 events, 22.3%) assessed by the investigator as study drug related.


• | 39 subjects (39/352, 11.1%) experienced a study drug related AE following the initial treatment visit, representing 76.5% of all subjects who experienced study drug related AEs (39/51). Progressively lower percentages of subjects experienced study drug related AEs following each repeat treatment: 3.4% (11/319) after the first repeat treatment, 1.5% (4/262) after the second repeat treatment, and none after the third repeat treatment.

The Phase II, EV-006 study’s primary objective was also to demonstrate the safety of Jeuveau™ in adult subjects receiving repeat doses of Jeuveau™ for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. Like EV-004, the EV-006 was a multi-dose study that lasted one year. Subjects were selected from a population of healthy adults at least 18 years of age who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown, agreed by both the investigator and the subject, as opposed to the sole assessment of the investigator in the EV-004 study. On Day 0, eligible subjects were administered a single treatment of 20 units of Jeuveau™. On and after Day 90, subjects were eligible for repeat treatment if their GLS score was a 2 or greater at maximum frown, as assessed by the investigator. If a subject did not have a GLS score ≥2, they were followed monthly until eligible for repeat treatment or until the study ended on Day 365.
Over the course of the one-year study, the 570 subjects in the study received a median total dose of 60 units, or 3 treatments. 
Total AEs

• | 235 subjects (235/570, 41.2%) experienced a total of 475 AEs.


• | Seven subjects (7/570, 1.2%) experienced eight SAEs, none of the SAEs were assessed as study drug related. One death (1/570, 0.2%) was reported during the study, a SAE, this event was not related to the study drug.

Study Drug Related AEs

• | 61 subjects (61/570, 10.7%) experienced a total of 91 AEs (91/473 events, 19.2%) assessed by the investigator as study drug related.


• | 37 subjects (37/570, 6.5%) experienced 46 study drug related AEs following the initial treatment visit, representing 60.7% of all subjects who experienced study drug related AEs (37/61). Progressively lower percentages of subjects experienced study drug related AEs following each repeat treatment: 3.6% (19/524) after the first repeat treatment, 3.2% (14/431) after the second repeat treatment, and 1.9% (4/214) after the third repeat treatment.

The combined Jeuveau™ drug-related eyelid ptosis rate for the EV-004 and EV-006 studies was 0.9%.

Additional Safety Evaluations
The five Evolus sponsored studies, EV-001, EV-002, EVB-003, EV-004 and EV-006, assessed the vital signs of subjects, and there were no notable differences found between the Jeuveau™ group and placebo. In the U.S.-based studies, EV-001, EV-002, EV-004 and EV-006, additional testing was conducted such as chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and electrocardiograms, and these additional tests did not reveal any notable differences between the Jeuveau™ and placebo groups. During the course of the U.S.-based studies, testing was also conducted looking for subjects who developed antibotulinum toxin antibodies after exposure to the drug, referred to as cases of seroconversion. There were two cases of seroconversion in the EV-004 repeat dose study. The formulation in the EV-004 study was not the same as the formulation used in all the other Evolus studies. Specifically, the formulation for the EV-004 study used a lyophilizing, or freeze drying, method for removing water. The pivotal studies EV-001 and EV-002, and the repeat dose study EV-006, used a Jeuveau™ formulation that was vacuum dried, and there were no cases of seroconversion in any subjects. This vacuum dried formulation was tested for antibotulinum antibody formations in 1,739 treatments in the 570 subjects in the repeat treatment EV-006 trial, and 492 treatments in the two U.S. single treatment Phase III trials, EV-001 and EV-002. We plan to commercialize the vacuum dried formulation of Jeuveau™.
Manufacturing
Daewoong manufactures and supplies Jeuveau™ to us. Daewoong has over 70 years of experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products and is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in South Korea. Daewoong has recently constructed a facility in which drug product for Jeuveau™ is produced. The facility is located in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. We believe this facility will be sufficient to meet demand for Jeuveau™ for the foreseeable future. The FDA conducted a current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and pre-approval inspection of the facility in November 2017 in connection with our BLA for Jeuveau™. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, also completed an inspection of the manufacturing facility in February 2018 in connection with our MAA. The U.S. FDA approval of Jeuveau™ in February 2019 included approval to manufacture Jeuveau™ at Daewoong’s facility.
Daewoong manufactures the Jeuveau™ drug substance in a separate facility on the same campus. The manufacture of Jeuveau™ drug substance is based on the fermentation of Daewoong’s C.botulinum cell line, followed by isolation and purification of the drug substance. Daewoong has received a U.S. patent for the production process. The drug substance production facility was renovated to comply with FDA and EMA cGMP requirements.
Our History
We were incorporated in November 2012 and are headquartered in Newport Beach, California. In a series of related transactions in 2013, SCH-AEON, LLC (formerly known as Strathspey Crown Holdings, LLC), or SCH, acquired all of our outstanding equity in exchange for membership interests in SCH. In 2014, SCH contributed our equity that it had acquired in 2013 to its subsidiary operating entity, ALPHAEON, in exchange for the payments described in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Payment Obligations Related to Our Acquisition by ALPHAEON.” As a result of these transactions, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALPHAEON. 
Daewoong License and Supply Agreement
On September 30, 2013, we entered into the Daewoong Agreement with Daewoong, pursuant to which Daewoong agreed to manufacture and supply Jeuveau™ and grant us an exclusive license to import, distribute, promote, market, develop, offer for sale and otherwise commercialize and exploit Jeuveau™ in the United States, EU, Canada, Australia, Russia, C.I.S., and South Africa, each, a covered territory. Daewoong also granted us a non-exclusive license to do the same in Japan. In connection with our entry into the Daewoong Agreement, we made an upfront payment to Daewoong of $2.5 million and agreed to make milestone payments upon certain confidential development and commercial milestones, including payment to Daewoong upon each of FDA and EMA approval of Jeuveau™. Under the Daewoong Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of future milestone payments that could be owed to Daewoong upon the satisfaction of all milestones is $13.5 million as of December 31, 2018. In February 2019, we paid $2.0 million to Daewoong upon obtaining FDA approval of Jeuveau™. Under the Daewoong Agreement, Daewoong is responsible for all costs related to the manufacturing of Jeuveau™, including costs related to the operation and upkeep of its manufacturing facility, and we are responsible for all costs related to obtaining regulatory approval, including clinical expenses, and commercialization of Jeuveau™.
Under the Daewoong Agreement, Daewoong has agreed to supply us with Jeuveau™ at an agreed-upon, transfer price, and we have agreed to make milestone payments upon completion of certain confidential development and commercial milestones. Our 
15

exclusivity is subject to certain minimum annual purchases upon commercialization, irrespective of aesthetic or therapeutic indications, and if we fail to meet these targets, Daewoong may, at its option, convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share in various jurisdictions. During the term of the Daewoong Agreement, we cannot purchase, sell or distribute any competing products in a covered territory or Japan or sell Jeuveau™ outside a covered territory or Japan. We also have the option to negotiate first with Daewoong to secure a distribution license for any product that Daewoong directly or indirectly develops or commercializes that is classified as an injectable botulinum toxin (other than Jeuveau™) in a covered territory or Japan. 
The initial term of the Daewoong Agreement is from September 30, 2013 to the later of (i) the fifth anniversary of approval from the relevant governmental authority necessary to market and sell Jeuveau™ or (ii) September 30, 2023, and automatically renews for unlimited additional three-year terms if we meet certain performance requirements. The Daewoong Agreement will terminate (A) upon written notice by either us or Daewoong upon a continuing default that remains uncured within 90 days (or 30 days for a payment default) by the other party, or (B) without notice upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of our company. 
In addition to the aesthetic use of Jeuveau™, we held an option to obtain the therapeutic rights to botulinum toxin products in the licensed territories which was held in trust for ALPHAEON. In September 2018, ALPHAEON exercised the right to obtain the therapeutic rights and remitted the option exercise price directly to Daewoong. 
We are the sole owner of any marketing authorization and clinical trial results we pursue in a covered territory. However, if we do not renew the Daewoong Agreement or upon termination of the Daewoong Agreement due to a breach by us, we are obligated to transfer our rights to Daewoong.
The Daewoong Agreement also provides that Daewoong will indemnify us for any losses arising out of (i) Daewoong’s willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing its obligations under the agreement, (ii) Daewoong’s breach of the agreement, or (iii) any allegation that Jeuveau™ or Daewoong’s trademark infringes or misappropriates the rights of a third party, except, in each case, as a result of our willful misconduct or gross negligence. We have agreed to indemnify Daewoong for any losses arising out of (A) our willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing our obligations under the agreement, or (B) our breach of the agreement, except, in each case, as a result of Daewoong’s willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
Competition
Our primary competitors in the pharmaceutical market are companies offering injectable dose forms of botulinum toxin. There are only four approved injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxins in the United States, including Jeuveau™. There are also other injectable botulinum toxin type A products being developed for the U.S. market. We believe the primary competing products in this market include BOTOX, Dysport and Xeomin:

• | BOTOX, marketed by Allergan plc, or Allergan, received FDA approval in 2002 for glabellar lines. Allergan was the first company to market neurotoxins for aesthetic purposes.


• | Dysport, marketed by Galderma S.A., or Galderma, received FDA approval in 2009 for glabellar lines.


• | Xeomin, marketed by Merz Pharma GmbH & Co., or Merz, received FDA approval in 2011 for glabellar lines.

In addition to the companies commercializing neurotoxins, there are other products and treatments that may indirectly compete with Jeuveau™, such as dermal fillers, laser treatments, brow lifts, chemical peels, fat injections and cold therapy. We compete with various companies that have products in these medical aesthetic categories. Among these companies are Allergan, Sanofi, Sun Pharma, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., or Valeant, Mentor Worldwide LLC, a division of Johnson & Johnson, Merz, Galderma, and Skinceuticals, a division of L’Oreal SA. In addition, we are aware of other companies also developing and/or marketing products in one or more of our target markets, including competing injectable botulinum toxin type A formulations that are in various phases of development in North America for the treatment of glabellar lines. 
Government Regulation Applicable to Us
We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or 
16

FFDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHS Act, among others. Biologics and medical devices are subject to regulation under the FFDCA and PHS Act.
In the United States, cosmetics, dietary supplements, biopharmaceutical products and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FFDCA, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, regulatory approval, license or clearance, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of these products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending license or marketing applications, warning letters and other enforcement actions, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigative new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use, according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements including those for the protection of human research subjects and their health and other personal information;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety;


• | purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices for the use of human cellular and tissue products;


• | potential FDA audits of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.

Preclinical Studies
Biological product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs, among other requirements. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical Studies
Clinical trials must be conducted pursuant to an IND and in compliance with federal regulations and GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol 
17

amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other requirements or sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The clinical trial protocol, any protocol amendments, and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent form that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase I. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase II. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase I, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand subjects, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.


• | Phase IV. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials.

Marketing Approval
Clinical trials to support BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the investigational biologic candidate into patients, the investigational biologic is tested to assess side effects and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited subject population to determine the effectiveness of the investigational biologic for a particular indication or indications and identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
If an investigational biologic demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide adequate information for its labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the biologic for use in a specific indication or population. A single Phase III clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee, and the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved BLA are also subject to annual FDA product and establishment user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is 
18

accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologics products are reviewed within twelve months of submission; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within eight months of submission. Priority review for biologics is limited to those products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease with unmet medical need relative to the currently approved products. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologics products or biologics products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that compliance with cGMP is satisfactory. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general biological product standards. After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, including additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, ingredients or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable regulations such as cGMP and the Quality System Regulation. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Biosimilar Approval Process
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to an existing brand product.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years. The BPCIA is 
19

complex and is still in the process of being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact and implementation are subject to uncertainty.
Government Regulation in Europe
In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs:

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.

Because we are a biotechnology medicinal products company, we are eligible for a Community MA under the Centralized Procedure.
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Product Approval Process Outside the United States and Europe
In addition to regulations in the United States and EU, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval or MA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval or MA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse
While we do not currently have plans for our neurotoxin product to be covered by insurance or government reimbursement programs, if we were to offer reimbursable products, we could be subject to federal laws and regulations covering reimbursable products, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and Physician Payment Sunshine Act. These laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (including any ownership, kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return, for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is made, in

20

whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply, among others, to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for a statutory exception or a regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $25,000 for each violation and imprisonment of up to five years for each violation. Violations are also subject to sanctions under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, including penalties of up to $50,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act of up to $11,000 for each claim submitted, plus up to three times the amounts paid for such claims, and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs;

• | the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, the government may impose penalties of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 per claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the submission of a false claim, and may exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Recently, the civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Medicaid Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of supplier or provider Medicare numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of drugs or off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, and misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered or items provided, among other issues;


• | the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;


• | the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Significantly, the HIPAA provisions apply not only to federal programs, but also to private health benefit programs. HIPAA also broadened the authority of the Office of Inspector General to exclude participants from federal healthcare programs; and


• | the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which require that certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report to the CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers, teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may

21

result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Some state laws require biopharmaceutical companies to adopt or disclose specific compliance policies to regulate a company’s interactions with healthcare professionals. Moreover, some states, such as Minnesota and Vermont, also impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians.
We may also be subject to analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or self-pay patients; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
We are also subject to data privacy and security regulation by the federal government, states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state and non-U.S. laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the EU, govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. 
Employees
As of February 28, 2019, we had 70 employees, all of whom constituted full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
