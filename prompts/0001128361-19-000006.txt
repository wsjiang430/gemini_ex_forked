Item 1.    BUSINESS
General
Hope Bancorp, Inc. (“Hope Bancorp” on a parent-only basis, and the “Company,” “we” or “our” on a consolidated basis with the Bank of Hope) is a bank holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in the year 2000. Previously known as BBCN Bancorp Inc., the Company changed its name to Hope Bancorp at the time of the merger with Wilshire Bancorp Inc. (“Wilshire”) on July 29, 2016. We offer commercial and retail banking loan and deposit products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bank of Hope (formerly BBCN Bank), a California state-chartered bank (the “Bank” or “Bank of Hope”). The Bank primarily focuses its business in ethnic communities in California, New Jersey and New York City, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Seattle and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. Our headquarters are located at 3200 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1400, Los Angeles, California 90010, and our telephone number at that address is (213) 639-1700.
Hope Bancorp exists primarily for the purpose of holding the stock of the Bank and other subsidiaries it may acquire or establish. Bank of Hope’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), up to applicable limits.
We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, as well as proxy and information statements in connection with our stockholders’ meetings. The SEC maintains a website that contains the reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of the website is www.sec.gov. Our website address is www.bankofhope.com. Electronic copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and other information and reports we file with the SEC and amendments to those reports, are available free of charge by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. These reports are generally posted as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with the SEC. None of the information on or hyperlinked from the Company’s website is incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Mergers and Acquisitions
On July 29, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Wilshire, previously headquartered in Los Angeles, California. With the completion of the acquisition, 35 branches in California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Alabama, and Georgia were added to our existing branch network in addition to six loan production offices. Some of these branch locations and loan production offices were subsequently closed as part of our consolidation plan. Our current consolidated network consists of 63 branches and 11 loan production offices.
The Wilshire acquisition was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805 “Business Combinations,” and the assets and liabilities of Wilshire were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of assets acquired from Wilshire totaled approximately $4.63 billion and goodwill recorded from acquisitions consummated in 2016 totaled $359.0 million.

Business Overview
Our principal business activities are conducted through the Bank and primarily consist of earning interest on loans and investment securities that are primarily funded by customer deposits and other borrowings. Operating revenues consist of the difference between interest received and interest paid, gains and losses on the sale of financial assets, and fees earned for financial services provided to our customers. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, new legislation and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Although our business may vary with local and national economic conditions, such variations are not generally seasonal in nature.
Through our current network of 63 branches and 11 loan production offices, we offer core business banking products for small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. We accept deposits and originate a variety of loans, including commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans, trade finance loans, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, auto loans, single-family mortgages, warehouse lines of credit, personal loans, and credit cards. We offer cash management services to our business customers, which include remote deposit capture, lock box, and ACH origination services. We offer comprehensive investment and wealth management services to high-net-worth clients. We also offer a mobile banking application for smart devices that extends access to banking services, such as mobile deposits and bill payment, for our customers at all times. In an effort to better meet our customers’ needs, our mini-market branches generally offer hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Most of our branches offer 24-hour automated teller machines (“ATMs”). We also offer debit card services to all customers. In addition, most of our branches offer foreign exchanges services, safe deposit boxes, and other customary bank services. Our website at www.bankofhope.com offers internet banking services and applications in both English and Korean.
Lending Activities
Commercial Business Loans
We provide commercial loans to businesses for various purposes such as for working capital, purchasing inventory, debt refinancing, business acquisitions, and other business related financing needs. Commercial loans are typically classified as (1) short-term loans (or lines of credit) or (2) long-term loans (or term loans to businesses). Short-term loans are often used to finance current assets such as inventory and accounts receivable and typically have terms of one year with interest paid monthly on the outstanding balance with the principal balance due at maturity. Long-term loans typically have terms of five to seven years with principal and interest paid monthly. The credit worthiness of our borrowers is determined before a loan is originated and is periodically reviewed to ascertain whether credit quality changes have occurred. Commercial business loans are typically collateralized by the borrower’s business assets and/or real estate. We seek to establish deposit relationships with all of our commercial business loan customers.
Our commercial business loan portfolio includes trade finance loans from our Corporate Banking Center, which generally serves businesses involved in international trade activities. These loans are typically collateralized by business assets and are used to meet the short-term working capital needs (accounts receivable and inventory financing) of our borrowers. Our International Operations Department issues and advises on letters of credit for export and import businesses. The underwriting procedure for this type of credit is the same as for commercial business loans. We offer the following types of letters of credit to customers:

• | Commercial: An undertaking by the issuing bank to pay for a commercial transaction.


• | Standby: An undertaking by the issuing bank to pay for the non-performance of the applicant customer.


• | Revocable: Letter of credit that can be modified or cancelled by the issuing bank at any time with notice to the beneficiary (does not provide the beneficiary with a firm promise of payment).


• | Irrevocable: Letter of credit that cannot be altered or cancelled without mutual consent of all parties.


• | Sight: Letter of credit requiring payment upon presentation of conforming shipping documents.


• | Usance: Letter of credit that allows the buyer to delay payment up to a designated number of days after presentation of shipping documents.


• | Import: Letter of credit issued to assist customers in purchasing goods from overseas.


• | Export: Letter of credit issued to assist customers in selling goods overseas.


• | Transferable: Letter of credit that allows the beneficiary to transfer its drawing (payment) rights, in part or full, to another.


• | Non-transferable: Letter of credit that does not allow the beneficiary to transfer their right, in part or full, to another.

Our trade finance services include the issuance and negotiation of letters of credit, as well as the handling of documentary collections. On the export side, we provide advice and negotiation of commercial letters of credit and we transfer and issue back-to-back letters of credit. We also provide importers with trade finance lines of credit, which allow for the issuance of commercial letters of credit and the financing of documents received under such letters of credit, as well as documents received under documentary collections. Exporters are assisted through export lines of credit as well as through immediate financing of clean documents presented under export letters of credit.
We provide commercial equipment lease financing through a relationship with a third-party leasing company. Equipment leasing loans are generally capital leases with maturities up to five years.
We also provide warehouse lines of credit to mortgage loan originators. The lines of credit are used by these originators to fund mortgages which are then pledged to the Bank as collateral until the mortgage loans are sold and the lines of credit are paid down. The typical duration of these lines of credit from the time of funding to pay-down ranges from 10-30 days. Although collateralized by mortgage loans, the structure of warehouse lending agreements results in the commercial and industrial loan treatment for these types of loans.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
Real estate loans are extended for the purchase and refinance of commercial real estate and are generally secured by first deeds of trust. The maturities on the majority of such loans are generally five to seven years with a 25-year principal amortization schedule and a balloon payment due at maturity. We offer both fixed and floating rate commercial real estate loans. It is our general policy to restrict commercial real estate loan amounts to 75% of the appraised value of the property at the date of origination.
We originate loans to finance construction projects including one-to-four family residences, multifamily residences, senior housing, and commercial projects. Residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates. Construction loans are considered to have higher risks than other loans due to the ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, and the availability of long-term financing. Economic conditions may also impact our ability to recover our investment in construction loans. Adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the real estate market, which could affect the borrowers’ ability to complete and sell the project. Additionally, the fair value of the underlying collateral may fluctuate as market conditions change. As construction loans make up only a small percentage of the total loan portfolio, these loans are not further broken down into classes.
Small Business Administration Loans
We extend loans partially guaranteed by the SBA. We primarily extend SBA loans known as SBA 7(a) loans and SBA 504 loans. SBA 7(a) loans are typically extended for working capital needs, purchase of inventory, purchase of machinery and equipment, debt refinance, business acquisitions, start-up financing, or to purchase or construct owner-occupied commercial property. SBA 7(a) loans are typically term loans with maturities up to 10 years for loans not secured by real estate and up to 25 years for real estate secured loans. SBA loans are fully amortizing with monthly payments of principal and interest. SBA 7(a) loans are typically floating rate loans that are secured by business assets and/or real estate. Depending on the loan amount, each loan is typically guaranteed 75% to 85% by the SBA, with a maximum gross loan amount to any one small business borrower of $5.0 million and a maximum SBA guaranteed amount of $3.75 million.
We are generally able to sell the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market at a premium, while earning servicing fee income on the sold portion over the remaining life of the loan. In addition to the interest yield earned on the unguaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans that are not sold, we can recognize income from gains on sales and from loan servicing on the SBA 7(a) loans that are sold. Although we have historically sold the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans that we originated, we recently made the decision to retain these loans due to the decline in premiums offered in the secondary market. Therefore, for the time being, we will be retaining these loans and earn interest income on the guaranteed portion of SBA loans as well the unguaranteed portions.
SBA 504 loans are typically extended for the purpose of purchasing owner-occupied commercial real estate or long-term capital equipment. SBA 504 loans are typically extended for up to 20 years or the life of the asset being financed. SBA 504 loans are financed as a participation loan between the Bank and the SBA through a Certified Development Company (“CDC”). Generally, the loans are structured to give the Bank a 50% first deed of trust (“TD”), the CDC a 40% second TD, and the remaining 10% is funded by the borrower. Interest rates for first TD Bank loans are subject to normal bank commercial rates and terms, and the second TD CDC loans are fixed for the life of the loans based on certain indices.
5

All of our SBA loans are originated through our SBA Loan Departments. The SBA Loan Departments are staffed by loan officers who provide assistance to qualified businesses. The Bank has been designated as an SBA Preferred Lender, which is the highest designation awarded by the SBA. This designation generally facilitates a more efficient marketing and approval process for SBA loans. We have attained SBA Preferred Lender status nationwide.
Consumer Loans
Our consumer loans consist of single-family mortgages, home equity, auto loans, and personal loans, with a majority of our consumer loan portfolio currently consisting of single-family mortgages secured by a first deed of trust on single family residences under a variety of loan products including fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages with either 30-year or 15-year terms. Adjustable rate mortgage loans are also offered with flexible initial and periodic adjustments ranging from five to seven years. 
Investing Activities
The main objective of our investment strategy is to provide a source of on-balance sheet liquidity while providing a means to manage our interest rate risk, and to generate an adequate level of interest income without taking undue risks. Subject to various restrictions, our investment policy permits investment in various types of securities, certificates of deposit (“CDs”), and federal funds sold. Our investment portfolio has consisted of government sponsored agency bonds, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), corporate securities, municipal securities, and mutual funds. For a detailed breakdown of our investment portfolio, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition – Investment Security Portfolio.”
Our securities are classified for accounting purposes as available for sale. We do not maintain held to maturity or trading investment portfolios. Securities purchased to meet investment-related objectives, such as liquidity management or interest rate risk and which may be sold as necessary to implement management strategies, are designated as available for sale at the time of purchase.
Deposit Activities
We attract both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit products and services. Through our branch network, we provide our banking customers with personal and business checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, time deposit accounts, individual retirement accounts, 24-hour ATMs, internet banking and bill-pay, remote deposit capture, lock boxes, and ACH origination services. In addition to our retail and business deposits, we obtain both secured and unsecured wholesale deposits including public deposits such as State of California Treasurer’s time deposits, brokered money market and time deposits, and deposits gathered from outside of the Bank’s normal market area through deposit listing services.
FDIC-insured deposits are our primary source of funds. As part of our asset-liability management, we analyze our retail and wholesale deposit maturities and interest rates to monitor and manage our cost of funds, to the extent feasible in the context of changing market conditions, as well as to promote stability in our supply of funds. For additional information on deposits, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition – Deposits.”
Borrowing Activities
When we have more funds than required for our reserve requirements or short-term liquidity needs, we may sell federal funds to other financial institutions. Conversely, when we have less funds than required, we may borrow funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the “FHLB”), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“the Federal Reserve Bank”), or our correspondent banking relationships. In addition, we may borrow from the FHLB on a longer term basis to provide funding for certain loan or investment securities strategies, as well as asset-liability management strategies.
The FHLB functions in a reserve credit capacity for qualifying financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and may apply for advances from the FHLB on an unsecured basis or by utilizing qualifying loans and certain securities as collateral. The FHLB offers a full range of borrowing programs on its advances, with terms ranging from one day to thirty years, at competitive market rates. A prepayment penalty is usually imposed for early repayment of these advances. Information concerning FHLB advances and other borrowings is included in Note 9 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”
We may also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank. The maximum amount that we may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount window is up to 95% of the outstanding principal balance of the qualifying loans and the fair value of the securities that we pledge.

Long-Term Debt
At December 31, 2018, nine wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trusts (“Trusts”) had issued $126.0 million of pooled trust preferred securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”). The Trust Preferred Securities accrue and pay distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in the related indentures for the securities. The Trusts used the net proceeds from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities to purchase a like amount of subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”) issued by us. The Debentures are the sole assets of the trusts. Our obligations under the Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of the obligations of the trusts. The Trust Preferred Securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the Debentures (which have maturity dates ranging from 2033 to 2037), or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indentures. We have the right to redeem the Debentures in whole (but not in part) on a quarterly basis at a specified redemption price. We also have the right to defer interest on the Debentures for up to five years.
In 2018, we issued $217.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% convertible senior notes maturing on May 15, 2038 in a private offering to investors. Holders of the convertible notes can convert to shares of our common stock at a specified conversion rate at any time on or after February 15, 2023. Prior to February 15, 2023, the convertible notes cannot be converted unless under certain specified scenarios. The convertible notes can be settled in entirely cash, stock, or a combination of stock and cash at our option. We have the right to call the convertible notes on or after May 20, 2023 and holder of the notes can put the note on certain dates on or after May 15, 2023. The convertible notes were issued as part of our plan to repurchase shares of our common stock. Subsequent to the issuance of the convertible notes, we repurchased $150.0 million in common stock during 2018.
Market Area and Competition
We currently have 63 banking offices in areas having high concentrations of Korean-Americans, of which 35 are located in the Los Angeles, Orange County, Oakland and Silicon Valley (Santa Clara County) areas of California, 10 are located in the New York City metropolitan area and New Jersey, six are in the Chicago metropolitan area, four are in the Seattle metropolitan area, four are in Texas, two are in Virginia, one is in Alabama, and one is in Georgia. We also have 11 loan production offices located in Dallas, Seattle, Atlanta, Denver, Portland, Fremont, and Southern California and a representative office in Seoul, South Korea. The banking and financial services industry generally, and in our market areas specifically, is highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of strong competition among the banks servicing the Korean-American community, changes in regulations, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and consolidation among financial services companies. In addition, federal legislation may have the effect of further increasing the pace of consolidation within the financial services industry. See “Supervision and Regulation.”
We compete for loans, deposits, and customers with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, marketplace finance platforms, money market funds, credit unions, and other non-bank financial service providers. Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, are more widely recognized, have broader geographic scope, and offer a broader range of financial services than we do. 
Economic Conditions, Government Policies and Legislation
Our profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends, among other things, on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits, borrowings, and debt, and the interest income on our interest earning assets, such as loans we extend to our customers and securities held in our investment portfolio, as well as the level of noninterest bearing deposits, have a significant impact on our profitability. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as the economy, inflation, unemployment, consumer spending, and political changes and events. The impact that future changes in domestic and foreign economic and political conditions might have on our performance cannot be predicted.
Our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). The FRB implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as curbing inflation or preventing recession) through its open-market operations in U.S. government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the targeted federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the FRB in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and also affect interest rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities. The nature and impact on Hope Bancorp, and the Bank, of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies cannot be predicted.
7

From time to time, legislation and regulations are enacted or adopted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting, or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies, financial holding companies, and other financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures, and by various regulatory agencies. These proposals may result in changes in banking statutes and regulations and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase the cost of doing business, limit permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. See “Supervision and Regulation.”
Supervision and Regulation
General
Hope Bancorp and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under state and federal banking laws. This regulatory framework covers substantially all of the business activities of Hope Bancorp and the Bank. In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the bank regulatory agencies have recently emphasized capital planning and stress testing, liquidity management, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, anti-money laundering compliance, information technology adequacy, cybersecurity preparedness, vendor management, and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations. The federal and state regulatory systems are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, the FDIC deposit insurance fund (the “DIF”) and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of shareholders or other investors.
The following summarizes certain laws and regulations that apply to Hope Bancorp and the Bank. These descriptions of statutes and regulations and their possible effects do not purport to be complete descriptions of all of the provisions of those statutes and regulations and their possible effects on us, nor do they purport to identify every statute and regulation that may apply to us.
Bank Holding Company Regulation 
Hope Bancorp is a registered bank holding company. As a bank holding company, is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act. Hope Bancorp is also required to file periodic reports of its operations with the FRB and other such reports as the FRB may require. 
Bank holding companies are required to maintain certain levels of capital (See “Capital Adequacy Requirements”) and must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank. FRB regulations and polices limit the dividends a bank holding company may pay to its shareholders and the amount of its shares that it may repurchase. (See “Dividends and Stock Repurchases”.) FRB rules and policies also regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt and the FRB may impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem debt securities in certain situations. 
The FRB may require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the FRB believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary. Under certain circumstances, the FRB could, for example, prohibit Hope Bancorp from paying dividends or repurchasing is common stock on the basis that doing would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
The activities in which a bank holding company may engage are limited to those activities determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that elect and retain “financial holding company” status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) may also engage in broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be “financial in nature” or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. To elect and retain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be considered well capitalized and meet certain other requirements. Hope Bancorp has not elected financial holding company status and neither Hope Bancorp nor the Bank has engaged in any activities determined by the FRB to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature.
8

A bank holding company must seek approval from the FRB prior to acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or the ownership or control of voting shares of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5 percent of a bank. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC-insured depository institution. Federal banking regulators review competitive, management, financial, compliance and other factors when considering applications for these approvals. Similar California or other state banking agency approvals may also be required. 
The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. Therefore, the Bank and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO. DBO approvals are also required for certain mergers and acquisitions
Bank Regulation 
The Bank is a California state-chartered bank whose deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC, up to applicable limits. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the California Department of Business Oversight (the “DBO”) and the FDIC. In addition, while the Bank is not a member of the FRB, the Bank is subject to certain regulations of the FRB.
Federal and state laws and regulations applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, lending activities, servicing and foreclosing on loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, dividends, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. California banks are also subject to statutes and regulations including FRB Regulation O and Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, which restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to “insiders”, including officers, directors, and principal shareholders, and loans or extension of credit by banks to affiliates or purchases of assets from affiliates, including parent bank holding companies, except pursuant to certain exceptions and only on terms and conditions at least as favorable to those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated parties. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded definitions and restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under Sections 23A and 23B and also lending limits for derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDI Act”) and the California Financial Code, California state chartered commercial banks may generally engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called “closely related to banking” or “nonbanking” activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries or by subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Further, California state chartered banks may conduct certain financial activities permitted under GLBA in a “financial subsidiary” to the same extent as a national bank, provided the bank is and remains well-capitalized, well-managed and in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”). The Bank currently conducts no non-banking or financial activities through subsidiaries.
Capital Adequacy Requirements
Hope Bancorp and the Bank are subject to similar regulatory capital requirements administered by their primary federal supervisory banking agencies. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the federal banking agencies have adopted capital rules (the “New Capital Rules”) based on the Basel III Accord. The New Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, subject to certain phase-in provisions. The New Capital Rules are risk-based, meaning that the levels of capital required vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s balance sheet assets, such as loans and investment securities, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements. Bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. The classifications and, therefore, the required capital amounts are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk-weighting, and other factors. 
9

The New Capital Rules (i) introduce a new capital measure called “common equity Tier 1 and a related regulatory capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk‑weighted assets, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of common equity Tier 1 and “additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain requirements, (iii) mandate that most deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to common equity Tier 1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital compared to prior capital rules. The New Capital Rules also changed the risk-weights of certain assets used to calculate the risk-based capital ratios, such as those for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposure. The New Capital Rules also change the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities (subject to certain grandfathering exceptions for organizations like Hope Bancorp, which had less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009), mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and to include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities (unless the organization opts out of including such unrealized gains and losses).
Under the New Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios applicable to Hope Bancorp and the Bank are as follows:

• | 4.5% common equity Tier 1 to risk‑weighted assets;


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, common equity Tier 1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) to risk‑weighted assets;


• | 8.0% total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk‑weighted assets; and


• | 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on regulatory financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”). (To be considered well-capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, the Bank must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%.)

At December 31, 2018, the respective capital ratios of Hope Bancorp and the Bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to generally be deemed “well-capitalized” for bank regulatory purposes. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
The New Capital Rule create an additional “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital ratios. If Hope Bancorp and the Bank do not maintain capital sufficient to satisfy the capital conservation buffer, they would face restrictions in their ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares and pay discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer was phased in in increments of 0.625% beginning in 2015 through January 1, 2019. 
Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, which was fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, the minimum ratios for a banking organization to be considered “well capitalized” for bank regulatory purposes are as follows: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, Hope Bancorp and the Bank met all requirements under the New Capital Rules applicable to them on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were then in effect, including the capital conservation buffer. 
While the New Capital Rules set higher regulatory capital standards for Hope Bancorp and the Bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The implementation of the New Capital Rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company’s net income and return on equity, restrict the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses and require the raising of additional capital. 
The Bank is also subject to capital adequacy requirements under the California Financial Code. 
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Increased Supervision and Regulation for Bank Holding Companies with Consolidated Assets of More than $10 Billion
As a banking organization with consolidated assets exceeding $10 billion, the Company is subject to heightened supervision and regulation imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the following:

• | We are subject to periodic examination by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to compliance with federal consumer laws. Although we were previously subject to regulations issued by the CFPB, the Bank’s primary federal regulatory, the FDIC, previously had responsibility for our consumer compliance exams. See “Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.”


• | We are subject to the maximum permissible interchange fee for swipe transactions, equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions.

• | We are subject to the “Volcker Rule,” which generally restricts us from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered covered funds. While Hope Bancorp and the Bank had no investment positions or relationships at December 31, 2018 that were subject to the Volcker Rule, we may be subject to the compliance and recording keeping provisions of this rule.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires banking organizations with consolidated assets exceeding $10 billion to establish board-level risk committees and to perform annual stress tests. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2018 raises the asset thresholds for these requirements to $50 billion and $100 billion, respectively. 
Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act continue to be subject to rule-making and have yet to take full effect, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial industry generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate.
Prompt Corrective Action
The FDI Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution that does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the bank’s capital ratios, the agencies’ regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank’s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses. 
The prompt corrective action standards were revised to conform with the New Capital Rules. Under current standards, in order to be generally considered well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes, the Bank is required maintain the following minimum capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8%, a total capital ratio of 10% and a leverage ratio of 5%. A bank meeting the minimum capital ratios required to be considered well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may, however, may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants such treatment.
The federal banking agencies also may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise generally required to be deemed well capitalized for bank regulatory purposes, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions such as on taking brokered deposits.
Consumer Compliance Laws
The Bank must comply with numerous federal and state consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations, including, but not limited to, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, the California Homeowner Bill of Rights and various federal and state privacy protection laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and CAN-SPAM Act. The Bank and Hope Bancorp are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition.
These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, servicing, collecting and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Bank is subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The federal banking agencies consider a financial institution’s compliance with the CRA into account when considering regulatory applications for mergers and other expansionary activities. The Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating in the most recent public disclosure of CRA performance evaluation released by the FDIC in 2018, which states that the Bank’s CRA performance under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests supports the overall rating.

USA PATRIOT Act and Anti-Money Laundering Laws
Under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards that are intended to prevent and detect the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. 
The Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”) establishes requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions that are intended to help identify the source, volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the United States in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking, terrorism and other criminal activities. Under the BSA and related regulations, banking institutions must file suspicious activity reports and maintain programs designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding currency transactions. The programs must include systems and internal controls to assure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance and provide appropriate personnel training.
Loans to One Borrower
Under California law, the Bank’s ability to make aggregate secured and unsecured loans to borrower is limited to 25% and 15%, respectively, of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. The Bank has established internal loan limits that are lower than the legal lending limits for a California bank.
Deposit Insurance 
The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions, and safeguards the safety and soundness of the depository institutions. The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits. The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank’s depositors. The termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance would result in the revocation of the Bank’s charter by the DBO.
We are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we pay for FDIC insurance, which can be affected by the cost of bank failures to the FDIC, among other factors. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC’s DIF management authority by setting requirements for the Designated Reserve Ratio (the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits) and redefining the assessment base which is used to calculate banks’ quarterly assessments. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its asset size and its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors.
In 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule increasing the DIF’s minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% as required by the Dodd Frank Act. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the costs of increasing the DIF’s reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% was borne by depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, which had an impact on the Bank’s deposit insurance assessments because the Bank exceeded $10 billion in assets. In 2018, the FDIC reached the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% and as a result the FDIC does not currently assesses a surcharge on banks with total assets in excess of $10 billion. Any future changes in FDIC insurance assessments may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock.
Safety and Soundness Standards; Regulatory Enforcement Authority
The federal and California bank regulatory agencies have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of appropriate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution’s capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. 
12

If, as a result of an examination, the FRB, the FDIC or the DBO should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Company’s or the Bank’s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Company or the Bank or management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, these agencies have the authority to:

• | Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice;


• | Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which could preclude the Hope Bancorp or the Bank from being deemed well capitalized which, in the case of the Bank, would restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits, for example;


• | Restrict Hope Bancorp’s or the Bank’s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions;


• | Enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions, including required board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices;


• | Assess civil money penalties;


• | Require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and


• | Terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases
Hope Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of its common stock is subject to restrictions set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a Delaware corporation may pay dividends or repurchase its shares either (i) out of the corporation’s surplus (as defined by Delaware law), or (ii) if there is no surplus, out of the corporation’s net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. It is the FRB’s policy, however, that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. FRB policy requires that a banking holding company must notify the FRB its repurchase or redemption of shares would cause a net reduction of in the amount of such capital instrument outstanding at the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. It is also the FRB’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels or repurchase shares in amounts that would that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The FRB also discourages dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. In addition, if Hope Bancorp does not maintain an adequate capital conservation buffer under the New Capital Rules, its ability to pay dividends to or repurchase shares from shareholders may be restricted.
The Bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from Hope Bancorp. Hope Bancorp depends the Bank’s payment of dividends as primary source of cash for use in Hope Bancorp’s operations, Hope Bancorp’s payment of dividends to shareholders and Hope Bancorp’s stock repurchases. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends to Hope Bancorp is subject to provisions of the California Financial Code that limit the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank’s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). Where the above test is not met, cash dividends may still be paid, with the prior approval of the DBO, in an amount not exceeding the greatest of (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. The Bank’s ability to pay cash dividends to Hope Bancorp will also depend upon management’s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. If the Bank does not maintain an adequate capital conservation buffer under the New Capital Rules, the Bank may face restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to Hope Bancorp.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB as an independent entity within the FRB with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The bureau’s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions and banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency. The Bank is subject to examination by the CFPB. The CFPB has the authority to bring formal and informal enforcement actions against the Bank similar to those that may be brought by the federal banking regulators discussed above.

In 2014, the CFPB adopted revisions to Regulation Z, which implement the Truth in Lending Act, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, and apply to consumer mortgages. The revisions mandate specific underwriting criteria for home loans in order for creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay and establish certain protections from liability under the requirements for “qualified mortgages” that meet certain specific standards. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB also promulgated TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (”TRID”) rules which became effective in 2015 and require new mortgage disclosures. The Bank believes it has fully implemented the TRID requirements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,494 full-time equivalent employees compared to 1,470 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2017. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its relations with its employees are good.
