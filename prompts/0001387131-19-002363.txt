ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
 As used herein, the terms “IOR”, “the Company”, “we”, “our”, “us” refer to Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc., a Nevada corporation, individually or together with its subsidiaries. Income Opportunity Realty Investors, Inc. is the successor to a California business trust organized on December 14, 1984, which commenced operations on April 10, 1985. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and its common stock trades on the NYSE American. In June 2017, the Company changed its trading symbol from “IOT” to “IOR”.
    Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (“TCI”), owns approximately 81.12% of IOR’s outstanding shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, IOR’s financial results are consolidated with those of TCI. IOR is a “C” corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is included in the annual consolidated income tax return with TCI’s parent, American Realty Investors, Inc. “ARL”, and its ultimate parent, May Realty Holdings, Inc. (“MRHI”), a Nevada Corporation.
 
 IOR’s Board of Directors are responsible for directing the overall affairs of IOR and for setting the strategic policies that guide the Company. As of April 30, 2011, the Board of Directors delegated the day-to-day management of the Company to Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Pillar”), under an Advisory Agreement that is reviewed annually by IOR’s Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of IOR also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARL and TCI. The Directors of IOR are also directors of ARL and TCI.
     Since April 30, 2011, Pillar, the sole shareholder of which is Realty Advisors, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, the sole member of which is Realty Advisors, Inc. (“RAI”), a Nevada corporation, the sole shareholder of which is MRHI, a Nevada corporation, the sole shareholder of which is a trust known as The May Trust, became the Company’s external contractual Advisor and Cash Manager. Pillar’s duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges, for IOR’s benefit, debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors. As the contractual advisor, Pillar is compensated by IOR under an Advisory Agreement. IOR has no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to IOR in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement. This Advisory Agreement is more fully described in Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – The Advisor. Pillar also serves as an Advisor and Cash Manager to ARL and TCI.
     Regis Realty Prime, LLC, dba Regis Property Management, LLC (“Regis”), a Nevada limited liability company, provides brokerage services. Regis is entitled to receive real estate brokerage commissions in accordance with the terms of a non-exclusive brokerage agreement. (See Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance – Property Management and Real Estate Brokerage, below.)
     Business Plan 
     Our primary business is investing in real estate and financing real estate and real estate-related activities through investments in mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, we had no real estate holdings. The principal source of revenue for the Company is interest income on approximately $92.1 million of notes receivable due from related parties, out of which, $13.1 million are due from United Housing Foundation, Inc. (“UHF”) (Refer to Note 3).
     Our business is not seasonal. Management has determined to pursue a balanced investment strategy, seeking both current income and capital appreciation. With respect to new investments, management’s plan of operation is to acquire above average apartment and commercial properties, in keeping with the current class of properties in our real estate portfolio. Management intends to focus on income-producing property acquisitions to maintain a balance between income-producing and non-income-producing properties. Management does not expect that we will seek to fund or acquire additional mortgage loans. We may, however, originate mortgage loans in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of a property acquisition.

     Competition 
     The real estate business is highly competitive and IOR competes with numerous entities engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence), some of which have greater financial resources than IOR. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location, the allowable use of the property and the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to the property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining value. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. (See also Part I, Item1A. Risk Factors, above).
     To the extent that the Company seeks to sell any properties, the sales prices for such properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where IOR’s properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to penetrate or dominate a particular market.
     As described above and in Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, the officers and directors of IOR also serve as officers and directors of ARL and TCI. Both ARL and TCI have business objectives similar to those of IOR. IOR’s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both ARL and TCI, as well as to IOR, under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to IOR, ARL or TCI, management considers the respective investment objectives of each entity and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each entity’s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all three or two of the entities.
     In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, IOR competes with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives relative to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed IOR that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.
     We have historically engaged in and will continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties, including but not limited to asset acquisitions and dispositions. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm’s length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in the best interests of our company.
