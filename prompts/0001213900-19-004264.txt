Our Business
 
Software as a Service Internet Platform
 
We are a technology company that licenses its Social Life Network SaaS (Software as a Service) Internet Platform (hereafter referred to as the “Platform”) to niche industries for an annual license fee and/or a percentage of profits. The Platform is a cloud-based social network and eCommerce system that can be accessed by a web browser or mobile application that allows end-users to socially connect with one another and their customers to market and advertise their products and services. The Platform can be customized to suit virtually any international niche industry or sub-culture, such as hunting and fishing, tennis, real estate professionals, health and fitness, and charity causes.
 
Our Platform licensing agreements are for a minimum of two years and automatically renew each year thereafter. Our fee structure includes a combination of annual fees and/or a minimum of 20% of the net profits that are generated by the licensee from monthly subscriptions services, E-Commerce fees and online advertising sales from their platform users.
 
2

 

We developed our social networking and E-Commerce Platform specifically for industries that we believe have a passionate consumer base, that communicate in non-public channels, and their commerce activity is highly based on referral and “copy-cat” consumption; consistent with the foregoing, we license our Platform to the residential real estate industry and niche sports verticals like hunting and fishing. Our platform uses machine learning (A.I.) that interpolates the user behavior data through their online social activity to better connect the right people and businesses together, at the right time when online in our social network. Contrary to other social networks and E-Commerce systems like Facebook and Amazon where everyone is grouped together and forced to listen to the white-noise, our Platform increases online user connectivity and stronger relationships between businesses and their customers.
 
To date, our Platform is accessed by subculture industries in over 120 countries and is translated in multiple languages. Our language translation files for the Platform include 80% or more of the following languages: English, German, Hungarian, Portuguese, Turkish, Polish, Russian, Swedish, Slovenian, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Czech, Persian, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Romanian, Spanish, Italian and Japanese, which will position international use of our Platform immediately following our launch internationally through individual licensing agreements.
 
Business of MjLink.com, Inc. (Cannabis and Hemp Industry Platforms)
 
We also own and operate cannabis and hemp industry Platforms through MjLink from which we generate advertising revenue.

Revenue Generation
 
We generate revenue through:
 
(a) License Agreements - We generate revenue through licensing agreements from which we receive an annual license fee or a percentage of net profits.
 
(b) Online Advertising - Our advertising program enables advertisers to present online ads to a specific type of cannabis or hemp website audience, depending on the website and type of content that website provides in our network. We charge advertisers using the cost per thousand (CPM), which is a marketing term used to denote the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage.
 
We charge $10.00 CPM to an advertiser, which means the advertiser must pay $10.00 for every 1,000 impressions of its online advertising campaign. The “M” in CPM represents the Roman numeral for 1,000. Additionally, we provide the advertiser with the ability to purchase the CPM advertising campaign on specific websites in our cannabis and hemp network. This favors the ads that are most relevant to our webpage visitors, improving the experience for both the person looking for information in our network and the advertiser looking for targeted interested customers for their advertised product or service.

Charging advertisers by CPM (1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage) requires that we have enough website and webpage traffic (visitors viewing the webpages on a website) to sell to an advertiser. Therefore, we are dependent on marketing and advertising our own websites using print, radio, TV and online advertising in order to drive new and existing website visitors to our network. The more website traffic we experience each month, equates to the more advertising revenue we can generate each month.
 
(c) Digital Marketing - We provide business professionals with monthly subscriptions that enhance their online marketing and branding through our online business directory and online review management system. This marketing service allows a business to spotlight their online business listing, customer reviews and special offers and coupons, to our website network visitors.
 
(d) In addition to the existing online applications, MjLink’s management is focused on launching three new divisions that will provide incubation of early stage cannabis tech companies, B2B and B2C trade-shows, and M&A of cannabis technology companies.
 
Operations
 
We currently operate and support the ongoing technology maintenance of our online social network platform in the cannabis and hemp industry for the users from about 120 countries that access it each month. We also operate and support the ongoing technology maintenance and upgrades of our licensees’ social networks in the United States for the Sports Social Network and the Real Estate Social Network.
Our Market
 
Our market is intentionally broad and it includes engagement-based organizations, consumer brands, ad agencies, online marketers, advertisers, sponsors, social media celebrities, entertainment celebrities and performance artists, large and small enterprise users, religious organizations, health care providers, network marketing and multi-level marketing companies, media companies, major motion picture studios, social media companies, schools and training facilities, and virtually any other person or organization that seeks to attract, engage, and communicate with prospects, customers, consumers, fans, followers, patients, friends, and subscribers, among others, online, utilizing automated, interactive technology.

Competition
 
Our business is highly competitive, and competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.
 
We face competition in the social networking sector for the hemp and cannabis community, including WeedLife.com social network, which competes with one of the other social networks in the cannabis space, Massroots.com, which has 1 million members. Collectively with our licensees, we compete on a larger scale with Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay, and other social networks and E-Commerce sites for users’ engagement, all of which have substantially more financial resources, and a significantly larger user-base than we do.
 
We face significant competition with both our Cannabis/Hemp Social Networks and licensing of our E-Commerce Social Network Platforms, including MassRoots.com, Leafly.com, Zillow.com, HOUZZ.com, TennisChannel.com, and Cabelas.com, which offer a variety of online advertising and E-Commerce offerings. These competitors and other competitors have greater financial, operational, and personnel resources than we do. Should we fail to develop strategies to overcome our competition, our revenues will be negatively impacted.

Competitive Advantages 
 
Our competitive advantage is that we are solely dedicated to niche industries that business and consumer users that do not feel comfortable sharing content and information on other social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, as it may either jeopardize their personal and professional reputations or be completely lost in the white-noise of billions of other posts. Additionally, we have developed specialized features for these niche industries that incorporates E-Commerce directly in to a users’ social networking account. This integration of E-Commerce directly in to social networking sets our Platform apart from our current competitors.
Competitive Disadvantages 
 
Our competitive disadvantages are that we do not have the operational and financial resources that our competitors have, which results in our having fewer resources to market our social network brands, advertise our digital services, acquire new users on our social networks, and sell our advertising and digital services to business customers, as compared to our competitors.
Intellectual Property
 
Our technology platform and associated applications, features and functionality are comprised of proprietary software, code and know-how that are of key importance to our business plan.
Research and Development
 
We spent zero dollars on research and development during each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Sources and Availability of Products and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
We currently rely on certain key suppliers and vendors in the coding and maintenance of our software. Management believes it has mitigated the associated risks of these single-source vendor relationships by ensuring that we have access to additional qualified vendors and suppliers to provide like or complementary services.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
We are not dependent upon one or a few major customers and we do not expect to have any significant customer concentration.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government regulation is of significant concern for our business. Our management believes it currently possesses all requisite authority to conduct its business as described in this annual report. Our cannabis/hemp websites with respect to cannabis are dependent on state and Federal laws pertaining to the cannabis industry (See “Risks Related to Cannabis/Hemp Related Government Regulation” for further information regarding government regulation).
 
Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our operations are not subject to federal, state or local environmental regulations.

By the third quarter 2019 we are planning to hire as many as 40 full-time sales representatives, 20 full-time marketing and social media employees, 15 full-time production and customer support employees, and 4 part-time and 3 full-time executives, and management staff for our cannabis and hemp social network expansion plan, all of which is contingent upon adequate funding and/or financing.

None of our employees or consultants are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages and we believe our relations with our employees and consultants are excellent.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
We do not have a seasonal business cycle. 
 
Patents and Intellectual Property/Trademarks/Licenses/Franchises
