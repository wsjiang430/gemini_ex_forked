--------+---------

Introduction
 We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that provides leasing, property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition and other tenant-related services for a portfolio of office, residential, retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 97 properties that contained an aggregate of approximately 16.8 million net rentable square feet (collectively, the “Properties”). Our core portfolio of operating properties, as of December 31, 2018, excludes one development property and three redevelopment properties under construction or committed for construction (collectively, the “Core Properties”). The Properties were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2018:

 | Number of Properties | | Rentable Square Feet | | Percentage Occupied | | Percentage Leased
-------------------------+----------------------+----+----------------------+------------+---------------------+-------+------------------
Office properties | | 88 | | 15,609,156 | | | | 
Mixed-use properties | | 4 | | 646,741 | | | | 
Retail property | | 1 | | 17,884 | | | | 
Core Properties | | 93 | | 16,273,781 | | 93.3% | | 95.3%
Development property | | 1 | | 164,818 | | | | 
Redevelopment properties | | 3 | | 338,650 | | | | 
The Properties | | 97 | | 16,777,249 | | | | 

 In addition to the Properties, as of December 31, 2018, we owned land held for development, comprised of 237.4 acres of undeveloped land, of which 37.9 acres were held for sale, 1.8 acres related to leasehold interests in two land parcels each acquired through prepaid 99-year ground leases, and held options to purchase approximately 55.5 additional acres of undeveloped land. As of December 31, 2018, the total potential development that these land parcels could support, under current zoning and entitlements, including the parcels under option, amounted to an estimated 14.3 million square feet, of which 0.4 million square feet relates to 37.9 acres held for sale. As of December 31, 2018, we also owned economic interests in ten unconsolidated real estate ventures (collectively, the “Real Estate Ventures”) (see Note 4, “Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information). The Properties and the properties owned by the Real Estate Ventures are located in or near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Metropolitan Washington, D.C.; Southern New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; and Austin, Texas. 
 We conduct our third-party real estate management services business primarily through wholly-owned management company subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the management company subsidiaries were managing properties containing an aggregate of approximately 24.8 million net rentable square feet, of which approximately 16.8 million net rentable square feet related to Properties that we own and consolidate and approximately 8.0 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by third parties and the Real Estate Ventures.
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we owned and managed properties within five markets: (1) Philadelphia Central Business District (“Philadelphia CBD”), (2) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (3) Austin, Texas (4) Metropolitan Washington, D.C., and (5) Other. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The Metropolitan Washington, D.C. segment includes properties in Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C. and southern Maryland. The Other segment includes properties in Camden County in New Jersey and properties in New Castle County in Delaware. In addition to the five markets, our corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development of certain real estate properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions.
 Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “square feet” represent the net rentable area. We do not have any foreign operations and our business is not seasonal. Our operations are not dependent on a single tenant or a few tenants and no single tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total 2018 revenue.
 Organization
 The Parent Company was organized and commenced its operations in 1986 as a Maryland REIT. The Parent Company owns its assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership was formed in 1996 as a Delaware limited partnership. The Parent Company controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. As of December 31, 2018, the Parent Company owned a 99.4% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 0.6% interest in the Operating Partnership consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued to the holders in exchange for contributions of properties to the Operating Partnership. Our structure as an “UPREIT” is designed, in part, to permit persons contributing properties to us to defer some or all of the tax liability they might otherwise incur in a sale of properties.  Our executive offices are located at 2929 Walnut Street, Suite 1700, Philadelphia, PA 19104 and our telephone number is (610) 325-5600. We have offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Radnor, Pennsylvania; McLean, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; Camden, New Jersey; Richmond,

 2018 Transactions
 Real Estate Acquisitions
 On December 19, 2018, we acquired an office property containing 120,559 rentable square feet located at 4516 Seton Center Parkway in Austin, Texas, known as Quarry Lake II, for a gross purchase price of $39.5 million. We capitalized $0.1 million of acquisition-related costs and funded the acquisition with a borrowing of $39.0 million from our unsecured credit facility.
 On December 11, 2018, we acquired from DRA Advisors (“DRA”), its 50% ownership interest in the G&I Austin Office LLC real estate venture (the “DRA Austin Venture”) for an aggregate purchase price of $535.1 million. The DRA Austin Venture owned twelve office properties (the “Austin Venture Portfolio”), containing an aggregate 1,570,123 square feet, located in Austin, Texas. As a result of our acquisition, we acquired complete ownership of the Austin Venture Portfolio. The aggregate purchase price includes the carrying amount of our investment in DRA Austin Venture of $14.6 million. At settlement, we assumed $115.5 million of mortgage debt and received a credit at settlement of $130.7 million for a note receivable provided to the DRA Austin Venture on November 1, 2018. This note receivable was used to repay one of DRA Austin Venture’s mortgage loans prior to the December 11, 2018 acquisition date. We also obtained working capital of $24.9 million. Subsequent to receiving cash proceeds of $28.3 million for our promoted interest in the DRA Austin Venture and recognizing a remeasurement gain of $103.8 million, reflected in the caption “Net gain on real estate venture transactions” in our consolidated statements of operations, we funded the acquisition with an aggregate cash payment of $117.3 million. Additionally, the assumed mortgage debt of $115.5 million was repaid at settlement. Both cash payments were effected through borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. We recognized a $28.3 million gain on our promoted interest in the DRA Austin Venture, reflected in the caption “Gain on promoted interest in unconsolidated real estate venture” in our consolidated statements of operations. The gain on promoted interest was based off of the returns earned over the duration of the DRA Austin Venture and the returns were determined based on operating results and real estate valuation of the venture.
 We previously accounted for our 50% non-controlling interest in the DRA Austin Venture under the equity method of accounting. As a result of our acquisition of DRA’s 50% ownership interest in the DRA Austin Venture, we obtained control of DRA Austin Venture and our existing investment balance was remeasured based on the fair value of the underlying properties acquired and the existing distribution provisions under the relevant partnership agreement, including our entitlement to a distribution on account of our promoted interest.
 On June 29, 2018, we acquired, through a 99-year ground lease, the leasehold interest in a one-acre land parcel, located at 3025 JFK Boulevard, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We prepaid $15.0 million of ground lease rent and capitalized $0.3 million of costs related to entering the lease. Additionally, the ground lease required us to pay $5.6 million for a leasehold valuation credit, which can be applied to increase the density of the projects subject to the Schuylkill Yards Project master development agreement.
 On March 22, 2018, we acquired, through a 99-year ground lease, the leasehold interest in a one-acre land parcel, located at 3001-3003 JFK Boulevard, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We prepaid $24.6 million of ground lease rent and capitalized $0.3 million of costs related to entering the lease.
 3025 JFK Boulevard and 3001-3003 JFK Boulevard are located within the Schuylkill Yards Project site in the University City sub-market of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See “Developments – Other Development Activities” section below for additional information.
 On January 5, 2018, we acquired, from our then partner in each of the Four Tower Bridge real estate venture and the Seven Tower Bridge real estate venture, the partner’s 35% ownership interest in the Four Tower Bridge real estate venture in exchange for our 20% ownership interest in the Seven Tower Bridge real estate venture. As a result of this non-monetary exchange, we acquired 100% of the Four Tower Bridge real estate venture, which owns an office property containing 86,021 square feet, in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, encumbered with $9.7 million in debt. Our acquisition of the 35% ownership interest in Four Tower Bridge resulted in the consolidation of the property. As such, we capitalized $0.1 million of acquisition related costs and allocated the acquisition value, consisting of the fair value of $23.6 million and the acquisition related costs, to tangible and intangible assets.

(b) | During the second quarter of 2018, Subaru exercised its purchase option under the lease agreement for the 83,000 square foot build-to-suit service center (the “Subaru NSTC Development”) and the sale closed during the fourth quarter of 2018. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the lease agreement and related revenue recognition.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | On December 20, 2018, we contributed a portfolio of eight properties containing an aggregate of 1,293,197 square feet, located in our Metropolitan Washington, D.C. segment (the “Rockpoint Portfolio”) to a newly-formed joint venture (the “Herndon Innovation Center Metro Portfolio Venture, LLC”) for a gross sales price of $312.0 million. We and our partner own 15% and 85% interests in the Herndon Innovation Center Metro Portfolio Venture, LLC, respectively. The Herndon Innovation Center Metro Portfolio Venture, LLC funded the acquisition with $265.2 million of cash, which was distributed to us at closing. After funding our share of closing costs and working capital contributions of $2.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, we received $262.4 million of cash proceeds at settlement. We recorded an impairment charge of $56.9 million for the Rockpoint Portfolio during the third quarter of 2018. We recorded a $0.4 million gain on sale, which represents an adjustment to estimated closing costs used to determine the impairment charge in the third quarter of 2018. For further information related to this transaction, see the “Herndon Innovation Center Metro Portfolio Venture, LLC” section in Note 4, “Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

 We sold the following land parcels during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
  
Disposition Date | Property/Portfolio Name | Location | Number of Parcels | | Acres | | Sales Price | | Net Proceeds on Sale | Gain on Sale |

Total Dispositions | | | | 2 | | 19.7 | | $ | 15,056 | $ | 14,921 | $ | 1,537 | 


(a) | As of March 31, 2018, we had not transferred control to the buyer of this land parcel, or two other parcels at this site which were sold during 2017, because of a completion guarantee which required us, as developer, to complete certain infrastructure improvements on behalf of the buyers of the land parcels. The cash received at settlement was recorded as “Deferred income, gains and rent” on our consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, the infrastructure improvements were substantially completed, at which time we transferred control of the land parcels. As a result, we then recognized the sales of the three land parcels during 2018 and recorded an aggregate $2.8 million gain. During the quarter ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an additional $0.2 million gain. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the infrastructure improvements and related revenue recognition.

 The sales of property and land referenced above do not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the operating results of these properties remain classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.
 Held for Use Impairment
 As of December 31, 2018, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value of certain properties that triggered an assessment under the undiscounted cash flow model. Based on our evaluation, we determined we would not recover the carrying value of one property located in our Other segment, 1900 Gallows Road, located in Vienna, Virginia, due to a reduction in the intended hold period. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million at December 31, 2018, reflected in the results for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, which reduced the carrying value of the property from $52.8 million to its estimated fair value of $37.9 million. We measured this impairment based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using a hold period of ten years and a residual capitalization rate and discount rate of 7.5% and 9.5%, respectively. The result was comparable to indicative pricing in the market.

Held for Sale
 The following is a summary of properties classified as held for sale but which did not meet the criteria to be classified within discontinued operations at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

 | Held for Sale Properties | 
--------------------------------+---------------------------------+------
 | December 31, 2018 | 
 | Pennsylvania Suburbs - Land (a) | | Other - Land (a) | | | Total
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE | | | | | | | | 
Real estate investments: | | | | | | | | 
Land inventory | $ | 4,254 | | $ | 7,345 | | $ | 11,599
Total real estate investments | | 4,254 | | | 7,345 | | | 11,599
Total assets held for sale, net | $ | 4,254 | | $ | 7,345 | | $ | 11,599


(a) | As of December 31, 2018, we determined that the sales of one land parcel in our Pennsylvania Suburbs segment and two parcels of land in our Other segment were probable and classified these properties as held for sale in accordance with applicable accounting standards for long-lived assets. At such date, the fair value less the anticipated costs of sale of the properties exceeded the carrying values. As a result, there is no impairment. The fair value measurement will be based on the pricing in the purchase and sale agreements.

 The disposals of properties referenced above do not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the operating results of the properties remain classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.
 Unsecured Debt Activity
 On December 13, 2018, we amended and restated our $250.0 million seven-year term loan maturing October 8, 2022. In connection with the terms of the amendment, the credit spread on the term loan decreased from LIBOR plus 1.80% to LIBOR plus 1.25%, reducing our effective interest rate by 0.55%. Through a series of interest rate swaps, the $250.0 million outstanding balance of the term loan has a fixed interest rate of 2.87%.
 On July 17, 2018, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit agreement (as amended and restated, the “2018 Credit Facility”). The amendment and restatement, among other things: (i) maintained the total commitment of the revolving line of credit of $600.0 million; (ii) extended the maturity date from May 15, 2019 to July 15, 2022, with two six-month extensions at our election subject to specified conditions and subject to payment of an extension fee; (iii) reduced the interest rate margins applicable to Eurodollar loans; (iv) provided for an additional interest rate option based on a floating LIBOR rate; and (v) removed the covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum net worth. In connection with the amendments, we capitalized $2.7 million in financing costs, which will be amortized through the July 15, 2022 maturity date.

Brandywine - AI Venture: Station Square Disposition
 On December 28, 2018, the BDN – AI Venture, an unconsolidated real estate venture in which we hold a 50% interest, sold three properties containing an aggregate of 510,202 rentable square feet located in Silver Spring, Maryland (“Station Square”), for a gross sales price of $107.0 million. At the time of sale, the properties were encumbered by a $66.5 million first mortgage financing, which was repaid in full at closing, resulting in a debt prepayment penalty of $0.7 million. Net of the first mortgage payoff and closing costs, BDN – AI Venture received cash proceeds of $34.8 million. On account of our 50% interest in the BDN – AI Venture, we received net cash proceeds of $17.4 million and recognized a $1.5 million gain on the sale, reflected in the “Net gain on real estate venture transactions” caption in our consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to the sale transaction, the BDN – AI Venture continued to own two properties containing an aggregate of 364,277 rentable square feet.
Brandywine - AI Venture: 3141 Fairview Park Drive Impairment
 During the period ended December 31, 2018, the BDN – AI Venture recorded a $20.8 million held for use impairment charge related to 3141 Fairview Park Drive and 3130 Fairview Park Drive (the “Fairview Properties”). As of December 31, 2018, after the $20.8 million impairment charge, the carrying value of the properties was $50.4 million. Our share of this impairment charge was $10.4 million and is reflected in the “Equity in loss of Real Estate Ventures” caption in our consolidated statements of operations for the period ended December 31, 2018. Subsequent to recording this impairment charge, we had a net basis of $15.8 million in the venture. See Note 4, "Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this disposition.
 Brandywine - AI Venture: Other Than Temporary Impairment
 As of December 31, 2018, we evaluated the recoverability of our investment basis in BDN – AI Venture utilizing a discounted cash flow model. Based on our evaluation of the fair value of our investment in the two properties that remained owned by the BDN – AI Venture subsequent to the disposition of Station Square, we determined that a persistent weak demand for office space and intense competition for tenants had reduced our share of the fair value of the remaining properties to be less than our investment basis in BDN – AI Venture. As a result, we concluded that the decline in value was other than temporary. Subsequent to recording a $4.1 million impairment charge, we had a net basis of $11.7 million in the venture.
 MAP Venture
 On August 1, 2018, MAP Venture, an unconsolidated real estate venture in which we hold a 50% ownership interest, refinanced its $180.8 million third party debt financing, secured by the buildings of MAP Venture and maturing February 9, 2019, with $185.0 million third party debt financing, also secured by the buildings of the venture, bearing interest at LIBOR + 2.45% capped at a total maximum interest of 6.00% and maturing on August 1, 2023. 
 Brandywine 1919 Ventures
 On June 26, 2018, we and our partner, LCOR/Calstrs, each provided a $44.4 million mortgage loan to Brandywine 1919 Ventures, an unconsolidated real estate venture in which we and LCOR/Calstrs each hold a 50% ownership interest. As a result, we recorded a related-party note receivable of $44.4 million in the “Other assets” caption on our consolidated balance sheets. The loan bears interest at a fixed 4.0% rate with a scheduled maturity on June 25, 2023. Brandywine 1919 Ventures used the loan proceeds to fund the $88.8 million repayment of its construction loan, which included $88.6 million in outstanding principal and $0.2 million of interest, on June 26, 2018.
evo at Cira Centre South Venture
 On January 10, 2018, evo at Cira, a real estate venture in which we held a 50% interest, sold its sole asset, a 345-unit student housing tower, at a gross sales value of $197.5 million. The student housing tower, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was encumbered by a secured loan with a principal balance of $110.9 million at the time of sale, which was repaid in full from the sale proceeds. Our share of net cash proceeds from the sale, after debt repayment and closing costs, was $43.0 million. As our investment basis was $17.3 million, we recorded a gain of $25.7 million.
 Developments/Redevelopments
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 237.4 acres of undeveloped land, of which 37.9 acres were held for sale, 1.8 acres related to leasehold interests in two land parcels, each acquired through prepaid 99-year ground leases, and held options to purchase approximately 55.5 additional acres of undeveloped land.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had four projects under development/redevelopment comprised of three office projects and one mixed-use project, which aggregate approximately 0.5 million rentable square feet, and a public park related to the Schuylkill Yards Project. We estimate the total remaining investment to complete these projects is approximately $56.4 million.  As of December 31, 2018, we 
 12

had invested approximately $89.1 million in these projects. For a detailed list of the properties under development/redevelopment see Item 2., “Properties.”
 4040 Wilson Venture 
 4040 Wilson, a 50/50 real estate venture between Ashton Park and us, is developing a 427,500 square foot mixed-use building, representing the final phase of the eight building, mixed-use, Liberty Center complex located in the Ballston submarket of Arlington, Virginia. The project is being constructed on a 1.3 acre land parcel contributed by Ashton Park to 4040 Wilson at an agreed upon value of $36.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 4040 Wilson achieved pre-leasing levels that enabled the venture to obtain a secured construction loan with a total borrowing capacity of $150.0 million for the remainder of the project costs. The total estimated project costs are $224.8 million, which we expect will be financed through approximately $74.8 million of partner capital contributions and $150.0 million in proceeds from the secured construction loan. As of December 31, 2018, $57.3 million had been advanced under the construction loan, and the venture had commenced construction of the mixed-use building. If construction costs were to exceed estimates, our equity method investment in 4040 Wilson could become other than temporarily impaired. As of December 31, 2018, we utilized a third-party valuation analysis to support our conclusion that 4040 Wilson is not other than temporarily impaired.
Other Development Activities 
 Schuylkill Yards Project
 On May 9, 2016, we entered into a master development agreement (the “Development Agreement”) with Drexel University, a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation, and an affiliate of Drexel University, (collectively “Drexel”), that provides for our rights and obligations, as master developer, of a multi-phase, multi-component development on approximately 10.0 acres of land owned by Drexel and adjacent to Drexel’s main campus in the University City section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the “Development Site”). Adjacent to the Development Site are an additional four acres controlled by Brandywine and Drexel which, when combined with the Development Site, comprise the 14-acre Schuylkill Yards Project master planned area. We refer to the overall development, including the Development Site, as the “Schuylkill Yards Project.”
 The Development Site is contemplated to be developed in six phases over an approximately 20-year period, excluding extension options, and is anticipated to consist of an aggregate of approximately 5.1 million of floor area ratio, or FAR, of office, residential, advanced manufacturing, research facilities and academic facilities, as well as accessory green spaces.  
 Prior to commencement of construction of the initial facility, we will oversee master planning, including obtaining required government and third party approvals and completing confirmatory real estate due diligence.  As of December 31, 2018 we have entered into a 99-year ground lease with Drexel for the portion of the Development Site where the initial facility will be constructed.  We will enter into similar ground leases with Drexel in connection with our construction of additional facilities under subsequent phases at the Development Site.  
 We contemplate that the initial phase of new construction at the Development Site will consist of a mixed-use facility containing approximately 500,000 square feet including traditional office, retail and residential space. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not finalized the scope of the development or entered into any construction contracts.
 On June 29, 2018, we acquired, through a 99-year ground lease, the leasehold interest in a one-acre land parcel, located at 3025 JFK Boulevard, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We prepaid $15.0 million of ground lease rent and capitalized $0.3 million of costs related to entering the lease. Additionally, the ground lease required us to pay $5.6 million for a leasehold valuation credit, which can be applied to increase the density of the projects subject to the Schuylkill Yards Project master development agreement. Of this deposit, $2.4 million must be applied to the development of 3001-3003 and 3025 JFK Boulevard. If we do not construct a minimum of 1.2 million square feet of (“FAR”) on these land parcels, the credit will not be realized. The remaining credit of $3.2 million can be used for development in excess of 1.2 million FAR at 3001-3003 and 3025 JFK Boulevard or toward future ground lease takedowns at the Schuylkill Yards Development Site. The deposit is reimbursed if the master development agreement is terminated by the landowner.
 On March 22, 2018, we acquired, through a 99-year ground lease, the leasehold interest in a one-acre land parcel, located at 3001-3003 JFK Boulevard, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We prepaid $24.6 million of ground lease rent and, in accordance with ASC 840, capitalized $0.3 million of costs related to entering the lease.
 For information regarding the 2017 acquisitions within the scope of the Schuylkill Yards project, see Item 1., “Business – 2017 Transactions,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
 Actual timing and scope of subsequent phases of development will depend on timing and scope of previous phases, third party approvals, preleasing and other design and development-related determinations.  Overall, approximately 52% of the FAR is designated office, including lab and academic space, and the balance would consist of residential, retail, hospitality and parking.
 13

We intend to fund the costs to develop each development phase of the Schuylkill Yards Project through a combination of cash on hand, capital raised through one or more real estate venture formations, and proceeds from the sale of other assets or debt financing, including project-specific mortgage financing. As of the date of this report, we have not entered into agreements with third parties for real estate venture participation in the project.
 The Development Agreement provides for rights, responsibilities and restrictions relating to all phases of the project, including, but not limited to, design and construction; leasing of space; involvement of third party participants; extension and termination rights; and protocols for reaching agreement on subjects customary for long-term collaborative development projects.
 Business Objective and Strategies for Growth
 Our business objective is to deploy capital effectively to maximize our return on investment and thereby maximize our total return to shareholders. To accomplish this objective we seek to:

• | concentrate on urban town centers and central business districts in selected regions, and be the best of class owner and developer in those markets with a full-service office in each of those markets providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maximize cash flow through leasing strategies designed to capture rental growth as rental rates increase and as leases are renewed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attain high tenant retention rates by providing a full array of property management, maintenance services and tenant service amenity programs responsive to the varying needs of our diverse tenant base;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality and financially stable tenants;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | form joint ventures with high-quality partners having attractive real estate holdings or significant financial resources;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | utilize our reputation as a full-service real estate development and management organization to identify acquisition and development opportunities that will expand our business and create long-term value;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increase the economic diversification of our tenant base while maximizing economies of scale; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selectively dispose of properties that do not support our long-term business objectives and growth strategies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also consider the following to be important objectives:
  
• | to develop and opportunistically acquire high-quality office properties at attractive yields in markets that we expect will experience economic growth and where we can achieve operating efficiencies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to monetize or deploy our land inventory for development of high-quality office properties, or rezone from office/industrial to residential, retail and hotel to align with market and demand shifts as appropriate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to control development sites, including sites under option to acquire, that could support approximately 14.3 million square feet of new office, retail and residential development within our core markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to capitalize on our redevelopment expertise to selectively develop, redevelop and reposition properties in desirable locations that other organizations may not have the resources to pursue;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to own and develop high quality office and mixed-use real estate meeting the demands of today’s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, and to manage those facilities so as to continue to be the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective tenants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to strategically grow our portfolio through the development and acquisition of new product types that support our strategy of transient-oriented and amenity based mixed-use properties located in the central business district of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania Suburbs; Austin, Texas; and Washington, D.C.; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to secure third-party development contracts, which can be a significant source of revenue and enable us to utilize and grow our existing development and construction management resources.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to concentrate our real estate activities in markets where we believe that:
  
• | current and projected market rents and absorption statistics justify construction activity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we can maximize market penetration by accumulating a critical mass of properties and thereby enhance operating efficiencies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | barriers to entry (such as zoning restrictions, utility availability, infrastructure limitations, development moratoriums and limited developable land) will create supply constraints on available space; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there is potential for economic growth, particularly job growth and industry diversification.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operating Strategy
 We currently expect to continue to operate in markets where we have a concentration advantage due to economies of scale. We believe that where possible, it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market. We also intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet our long term earnings growth expectations. We believe that recycling capital is an important aspect of maintaining the overall quality of our portfolio.
 14

Our broader strategy remains focused on continuing to grow earnings, enhance liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet through capital retention, debt reduction, targeted sales activity and management of our existing and prospective liabilities.
 In the long term, we believe that we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and acquisition opportunities, as warranted by market and economic conditions, in new markets that have healthy long-term fundamentals and strong growth projections. This capability, combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure, should allow us to achieve disciplined growth. These abilities are integral to our strategy of having a diverse portfolio of assets, which will meet the needs of our tenants.
 We use experienced on-site construction superintendents, operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management, to control the construction process and mitigate the various risks associated with real estate development.
 In order to fund developments, redevelopments and acquisitions, as well as refurbish and improve existing properties, we primarily use proceeds from property dispositions and excess cash from operations after satisfying our dividend and other financing requirements. The availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing properties largely depends on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control.
 Policies With Respect To Certain Activities
 The following is a discussion of our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by our Board of Trustees and our Board of Trustees may revise these policies without a vote of shareholders.
Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate
 Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in the value of operating assets. 
 We expect to continue our investment objectives primarily through the development, purchase or our current ownership in lease income-producing properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the properties presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such properties, in whole or in part, as circumstances warrant. Although there is no limitation on the types of development activities that we may undertake, we expect that our development activities will meet current market demand and will generally be on a build-to-suit basis for particular tenants where a significant portion of the building is pre-leased before construction begins. We continue to participate with other entities in property ownership through existing joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. Our equity investments may be subject to existing or future mortgage financing and other indebtedness that will have priority over our equity investments.
 Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers
 Subject to the ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other entities, including other REITs or real estate companies. We may enter into joint ventures or other arrangements for the purpose of obtaining an economic interest in a particular property. 
Investments in Real Estate Mortgages, Mezzanine Loans and Other Debt Instruments
 While our current portfolio consists of, and our business objectives emphasize, common equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of management or our Board of Trustees, invest in other types of equity real estate investments, mortgages, mezzanine loans and other real estate interests. We do not presently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages, mezzanine loans or unsecured loans, but may invest in mortgages, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans or preferred equity. From time to time, we provide seller financing to buyers of our properties. We do this when the buyer requires additional funds for the purchase and provision of seller financing will be beneficial to us and the buyer compared to a mortgage loan from a third party lender. Similarly, from time to time, we provide financing to our unconsolidated real estate ventures when the venture requires additional funds and the financing will be beneficial to us and the venture.
Dispositions
 Our disposition of properties is based upon management’s periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by management or our Board of Trustees that a disposition would be in our best interest. We intend to use selective dispositions to reduce our ownership in non-core markets and fund our capital and refinancing needs.
 15

Financing Policies
 A primary objective of our financing policy has been to manage our financial position to allow us to raise capital from a variety of sources at competitive rates. Our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. Our charter documents do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. Our financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by limiting our debt to a prudent level and minimizing our variable interest rate exposure. We intend to finance future growth and future maturing debt with the most advantageous source of capital that is available to us. These sources may include the sale of wholly owned properties or interests in real estate ventures, selling additional common or preferred equity and debt securities through public offerings or private placements, utilizing availability under our credit facilities or incurring additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our shareholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. This distribution requirement limits our ability to fund future capital needs, including for acquisitions and developments, from income from operations. Therefore, we expect to continue to rely on third party sources of capital to fund future capital needs.
Guarantees
 As of December 31, 2018, our unconsolidated real estate ventures had aggregate indebtedness of $370.3 million. These loans are generally mortgage or construction loans, most of which are non-recourse to us, except for customary carve-outs. As of December 31, 2018, the loans for which there is recourse to us consist of the following: (i) a $0.3 million payment guarantee on a loan with a $3.8 million outstanding principal balance, provided to PJP VII and (ii) up to a $41.3 million payment guarantee on a $150.0 million construction loan provided to 4040 Wilson. In addition, during construction undertaken by real estate ventures, including 4040 Wilson, we have provided and expect to continue to provide cost overrun and completion guarantees, with rights of contribution among partners or members in the real estate ventures, as well as customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of customary exceptions to nonrecourse provisions in loan agreements.
 In connection with the agreements of sale related to the Garza Ranch (See “Real Estate Acquisitions” section above), we entered into a development agreement and related completion guarantee to construct certain infrastructure improvements to the land on behalf of each buyer. Total estimated costs related to the improvements were included in the sale price of each land parcel. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the infrastructure improvements were completed and we recognized the sales. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the infrastructure improvements and related revenue recognition.
 In addition, during construction undertaken by real estate ventures, we have provided and expect to continue to provide cost overrun and completion guarantees, with rights of contribution among partners in the real estate ventures, and once construction is complete, customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of customary exceptions to nonrecourse provisions in loan agreements. For additional information regarding these real estate ventures, see Note 4, "Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
 Working Capital Reserves
 We maintain working capital reserves and access to borrowings in amounts that our management determines to be adequate to meet our normal contingencies.
 Policies with Respect to Other Activities
 We expect to issue additional common and preferred equity in the future and may authorize our Operating Partnership to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest, including to persons who contribute their interests in properties to us in exchange for such units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of unaffiliated issuers and we do not intend to do so. We intend to make investments consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations), our Board of Trustees determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including to joint ventures in which we participate and to buyers of our real estate. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Management Activities
 We provide third-party real estate management services primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (collectively, the “Management Companies”). As of December 31, 2018, the Management Companies were managing properties containing an aggregate of approximately 24.8 million net rentable square feet, of which approximately 16.8 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by us and approximately 8.0 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures.

Geographic Segments
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, we were managing our portfolio within five segments: (1) Philadelphia Central Business District (“Philadelphia CBD”), (2) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (3) Austin, Texas, (4) Metropolitan Washington, D.C., and (5) Other. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The Metropolitan Washington, D.C. segment includes properties in the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia and southern Maryland. The Other segment includes properties located in Camden County in New Jersey and properties in New Castle County in Delaware. In addition to the five segments, the corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development of certain real estate properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions. See Note 17, “Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on selected assets and results of operations of our reportable segments for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
 Competition
 The real estate business is highly competitive. Our Properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location, total occupancy costs (including base rent and operating expenses), services and amenities provided, and the design and condition of the improvements. We also face competition when attempting to acquire or develop real estate, including competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds, partnerships and individual investors. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon trends in the economies of our markets, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, land availability, our ability to obtain necessary construction approvals, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
Sustainability
 As one of the largest, publicly traded real estate companies in the United States, we seek to provide exceptional work environments for our tenants. Our current and recent developments and redevelopments reflect our commitment to energy efficient buildings with sustainable operating practices, as we seek to encourage the health and productivity of our tenants, while lowering operating costs and identifying revenue opportunities.
 In recognition of our commitments, we have been recognized as an industry leader in sustainability. During 2018, we ranked eighth among U.S. office companies in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) assessment. 2018 was the fourth consecutive year that we have ranked in the top quartile of GRESB assessment participants, earnings another “Green Star” recognition. We have been a past recipient of the Environment Protection Agency’s Energy Star Partner of the Year Award winner for sustained excellent for members that have demonstrated superior and sustained energy efficiency practices. We ended 2018 with 78% of our properties ENERGY STAR certified. In 2017, we ranked eighth among U.S. office companies in the GRESB assessment.
 Insurance
 We maintain commercial general liability and “all risk” property insurance on our Properties. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future. There are types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from war, terrorism, environmental issues, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes that are subject to limitations in certain areas or which may be uninsurable risks. We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impractical to use insurance proceeds to fully replace or restore property after it has been damaged or destroyed.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 329 full-time employees, including 11 union employees.
 Government Regulations
 Environmental Regulation
 Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment apply to us and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us.
 Existing conditions at some of our Properties. Generally, independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on our Properties. We generally obtain these assessments prior to the acquisition of a property and may later update them as required for subsequent financing of the property or as requested by a tenant. Site assessments are generally performed to ASTM standards then existing for Phase I site assessments, and typically include a historical review, a public records 
 17

review, a visual inspection of the surveyed site, and the issuance of a written report. These assessments do not generally include any soil samplings or subsurface investigations. Depending on the age of the property, the Phase I may have included an assessment of asbestos-containing materials. For properties where asbestos-containing materials were identified or suspected, an operations and maintenance plan was generally prepared and implemented. 
 Historical operations at or near some of our Properties, including the operation of underground storage tanks, may have caused soil or groundwater contamination. We are not aware of any such condition, liability or concern by any other means that would give rise to material, uninsured environmental liability. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns; there may be material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns that a review failed to detect or which arose at a property after the review was completed; future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability; and current environmental conditions at our Properties may be affected in the future by tenants, third parties or the condition of land or operations near our Properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks. We cannot be certain that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.
 Use of hazardous materials by some of our tenants. Some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and waste on our Properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations may subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. We generally require our tenants, in their leases, to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. We are not aware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our Properties, and we do not believe that on-going activities by our tenants will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 Costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters. Under environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the costs of removal, remediation or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances present or released on our Properties. These laws could impose liability without regard to whether we are responsible for, or knew of, the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may entail substantial costs and the presence or release of hazardous substances on a property could result in governmental cleanup actions or personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs.
 Potential environmental liabilities may exceed our environmental insurance coverage limits. We carry what we believe to be sufficient environmental insurance to cover potential liability for unknown soil and groundwater contamination, mold impact, and the presence of asbestos-containing materials at the affected sites identified in our environmental site assessments. Our insurance policies are subject to conditions, qualifications and limitations. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all liabilities for losses.
 Potential environmental liabilities may adversely impact our ability to use or sell assets. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.
 Americans with Disabilities Act
 Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to permit access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.  
Code of Conduct
 We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our Board of Trustees and all of our officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller and persons performing similar functions.
