Overview of the Market
 
The cannabis market has a multi-billion dollar potential. The industry is in its infancy and is rapidly being propelled towards its potential by the state legalization and the rush by suppliers to meet the pent-up demand. Most suppliers are small unsophisticated but capable operators. The federal legal constraints provide an opportunity to those companies early to the market to gain a first mover advantage and to the successful ones, an opportunity to be a consolidator in the industry. How can a company establish itself as a prestigious national brand when federal laws prohibit the sale of these products? How can a legitimate company respect these laws and be the first mover in the retail and wholesale trade in this industry?
 
What is Diego's Strategy, Phases One and Two?
 
Diego is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on high quality recurring revenues resulting from leasing real estate to licensed cannabis operators, and the management of operations for these and other third party cannabis operators deriving income from management and royalty fees. Diego provides a competitive advantage to these operators by developing “Diego Pellicer” as the world’s first premium marijuana brand and by establishing the highest quality standards for its facilities and products.


The Company's first phase strategy is to acquire and develop the most prominent and convenient real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed operators in the cannabis industry. Diego's first phase revenues result from leasing real estate and selling non-cannabis related accessories to our tenants. The company has developed a brand name strategy, providing training, design services, branded accessories, systems and systems training, locational selection, and other advisory services to their tenants. We enter into branding agreements with our tenants. In addition, part of the vetting process in finding the proper tenant is selecting a tenant that shares the Company's values and strictly complies with state laws, follows strict safety and testing requirements and provides consistent, high-quality products. If the tenants do not comply, they will not be allowed to use the brand.
 
The second phase of our strategy is to secure options to purchase the tenant's operations when it becomes legal on a federal level to operate cannabis distribution operations. When mutually advantageous for Diego and the tenant, Diego will negotiate acquisition contracts with selected Diego operators/tenants. When it becomes federally legal to do so, Diego will execute the acquisition contracts, consolidate our selected tenants and become a nationally branded marijuana retailer and producer concurrent with the change of federal law.
 
Diego Pellicer Management Company, will license the upscale Diego Pellicer brand to qualified operators and receive royalty payments, while providing expertise in retail, product and manufacturing from Diego’s accomplished management team with extensive industry experience 
 
Value Proposition
 
Value proposition 1: By providing branding, management experience, training, unique accessories, purchasing services, locational experience, standardized design, and experienced construction supervision, the tenant reduces his startup time, reduces cash drain, increases his efficiency, and builds his gross margin. Diego provides the capital for preopening lease costs and tenant improvements. This results in a turnkey retail location for the tenant. Thus, Diego’s real estate, management, consulting and accessory sales are positioned to deliver a premium return on our investment.


Value proposition 2: With each lease, Diego negotiates an acquisition contract with selected licensed tenants to acquire their operations. This contract will be executed at Diego's option, and upon changes to federal law, introduces our second value proposition-ownership of operations in an industry that is projected to exceed $8 billion by 2018.

Revenue Generation and Growth
 
Diego generates current revenue and stages future revenue streams through the following processes:
 

● | Acquire target properties to be improved for the growing, processing, distribution, and sale of medical and recreational marijuana, extracts and ancillary products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build and lease turnkey Retail, Processing and/or Growing facilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company may choose to secure management contracts with other retail and grow facilities to manage the business the “Diego Way.” This will generate additional revenue with which we can further expand our network of stores. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Negotiate merger agreements with favored partners that will trigger when marijuana commerce becomes legal federally. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Own DP Brands and other intellectual property. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Charge reasonable rents and management fees to tenants or operators to recover all build-out, start-up investment plus profit margin, and management expertise over the lease term. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sell non-cannabis branded products lines such as apparel and edibles to Diego stores. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Create an e-commerce platform selling non-cannabis branded merchandise 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to build and market the brand utilizing all forms of media including traditional and digital media, social media, e-commerce, and strategic partners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why We Believe this is a Winning Strategy
 
When the US and countries around the world legalize the commerce of marijuana on a national and international platform, Diego is positioning itself to be a dominate player in the marijuana marketplace. Diego will accomplish this by being a fully integrated marijuana retail operation and premium brand, capitalizing on the beautifully designed retail stores offering the finest quality products at competitive prices.
 
Most industries evolve through the same business cycle. Many small independent companies initially operate in fragmented markets in the early stages. Then there is a consolidation of the industry, with the consolidators thriving and the independent companies dwindling. The larger companies have access to cheaper capital, lower costs, better merchandising, brand name recognition, and more efficient operations. This what we offer out tenants when negotiating the lease: an agreement to acquire them when marijuana is legalized. This gives the tenant the ultimate opportunity to participate in the rapid consolidation that we believe will happen when marijuana is legalized. This consolidation will result in companies that have heretofore been unable to participate in the rapidly growing industry to be scrambling to enter the space. Diego and its tenants will already be established and consolidated. As an exit strategy, we want to position Diego to be a likely candidate for acquisition or a major player in the marketplace.
 
What we accomplished in 2018:
 
In 2018, Diego operated three Colorado facilities, and a Washington facility having received prestigious awards for “Most Valuable Brand of the Year” and “Best Retail Center” by the 2018 National Cannabis Business Awards. Diego now has four facilities generating rent in 2018 for the full year. The tenants in their first and second years of operations were quickly growing their sales and improving operational efficiency. Diego worked with these tenants, partially forbearing on their rent so as to allow these operators to strengthen their position and become capable of paying full rents. The properties generating rents in 2018 are as follows:


Table 1: Property Portfolio
 

Purpose | Size | City | State
---------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+---------+------
Retail (recreational and medical) | 3,300 sq. | Denver | CO 
Grow Warehouse | 18,600 sq. | Denver | CO 
Grow Warehouse | 14,800 sq. | Denver | CO 
Retail (recreational and medical) | 4,500 sq. | Seattle | WA 

 
Diego's Washington tenant opened our first flagship store in Seattle in October 2016. The Colorado tenant opened the Diego Denver branded flagship store in February 2017. In addition, Diego's two cultivation facilities in Denver, CO began production in late 2016.
 
Recurring lease revenues from signed agreements are amenable to forecast. Likewise, forecasting expenses of lease obligations for which Diego has signed contracts are also amenable to forecasting. Diego's leases will be generating cash of over $120,000 monthly net of lease costs. After amortization of construction costs, gross income from leases will be over $100,000. In addition to this, there will be income from accessory sales.

Diego will continue this strategy in states where recreational or medical marijuana sales and cultivation is legal under state law. Our business model is recurring lease revenue, royalties, management fees, and is entirely scalable. Our success will dependent upon continuing to raise capital for expansion, continual improvement of our business model, standardizing store design, controlling costs, new store management opportunities, and continuing to develop the brand.
 
What does our premium branding accomplish?
 
A very important aspect of our marketing plan is to build Diego Pellicer as a luxury brand. This not only enables us to establish a premium brand, but also to generate significant revenues from non- cannabis products.

The Company is establishing several levels of branding and will use these to appeal to the various segments of the marketplace depending upon the location, competition, legal constraints, and budget. Standard store templates are being developed, complimentary accessories selectively designed, and customer preferences and segments analyzed.
 
Our Seattle and Denver stores have been met with enthusiastic demand growing revenues quickly. This is proving the initial Diego concept.

The Industry: Retail Sales Continue to Rise Rapidly
 
Legalization of marijuana is a very recent movement. California was the first to legalize in 1996 when medical marijuana was approved. Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized the drug for recreational purposes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than half the states (31) – plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico – have legalized it for medical purposes. The list of states that have legalized marijuana could expand this November. Voters in Michigan and North Dakota will decide whether to allow recreational use. Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law.

The growth in public support for legal marijuana comes as a growing number of states have legalized the drug for medical or recreational purposes in recent years.
 




About six-in-ten Americans (62%) say the use of marijuana should be legalized, reflecting a steady increase over the past decade, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. The share of U.S. adults who support marijuana legalization is little changed from about a year ago – when 61% favored it – but it is double what it was in 2000 (31%).
 











As in the past, there are wide generational and partisan differences in views of marijuana legalization. Majorities of Millennials (74%), Gen Xers (63%) and Baby Boomers (54%) say the use of marijuana should be legal. Members of the Silent Generation continue to be the least supportive of legalization (39%), but they have become more supportive in the past year.

Annual cannabis retail sales continue to grow year-over-year as new markets emerge and more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana. Sales in 2018 are projected to increase by roughly 35% from 2017, on pace to reach more than $8 billion by the end of the year.

In 2018, retail marijuana sales in the United States are expected to increase by roughly 35%, on pace to reach over $8 billion by the end of the year. Despite the rocky rollout of California's new recreational industry, the market is massive and will be a major driver of sales growth this year. In mature markets like Washington state and Colorado, rec sales have continued rising - though at a slower rate than in previous years. In 2018, combined sales in those two states will easily eclipse $2 billion. Ongoing growth in Nevada's red-hot recreational market and the launch of adult-use sales in Massachusetts in late 2018 will further buoy sales in 2018. Based on our estimates, recreational sales will surpass medical sales for the first time in 2018, a major milestone for the cannabis industry. 
 
Overall, medical marijuana sales are expected to decrease for the first time in 2018 - driven by the massive transition taking place in California. Prior to 2018, all sales in the state were in the MMJ market, but now that recreational sales are underway, early reports suggest the vast majority of purchases taking place in licensed, regulated stores are to adult-use customers.
 
Outside of California, however, sales are expected to continue climbing, bolstered by ongoing growth in mature markets like New Mexico and Arizona, increased patient access in Florida and new MMJ programs coming online in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The transition to fully regulated, state-licensed MMJ sales in Michigan has caused some short-term instability, but it remains one of the largest medical markets in the country and will likely continue to form the foundation of the MMJ industry for years to come.
 
Ohio could begin MMJ sales at the very end of 2018, though it will take time for the program to fully develop. The state's MMJ market is particularly noteworthy, as it has the potential to generate upwards of $300 million in annual retail sales a few years down the road.
 
Setbacks in Arkansas and Maine have pushed back the start of their MMJ and adult-use sales, respectively, until 2019. More states will legalize marijuana in the near future, as New Jersey is on the short list to pass a recreational marijuana measure through the legislature and Arizona is likely to have an adult-use cannabis initiative on the 2020 ballot.
 
By 2022, we project total retail marijuana sales in the United States will reach approximately $22 billion annually - more than a threefold increase from estimated annual sales in 2017. Our estimates account for the fact that more states will likely legalize medical or adult-use marijuana in the coming years - though it's difficult to predict when that will happen and how big those markets will be. Using a range of estimates that incorporate several factors - such as the likelihood of a given state passing a legalization measure, the size of the customer/patient base and time frame for the launch of sales - helps account for this uncertainty. Our approach is refined over time as more information becomes available.

It's important to point out that the marijuana industry has a big and growing impact on the economy at large as the revenue it generates ripples across a community, city and/ or state - as well as the nation. To understand an industry's economic impact, traditional macroeconomic multipliers can range anywhere from 10 to 20 times the original dollar spent. Based on new data from other industries, we've settled on a standard multiplier of 3.5 for the marijuana industry - a slight revision from last year's multiplier of four.
 
In other words, for every $1 consumers/patients spend at dispensaries and rec stores, an additional $2.50 of economic value will be injected into the economy - much of it at the local level.
 

Source: 2018 Marijuana Business Daily, a division of Anne Holland Ventures Inc. (Note that our goal is to provide conservative, realistic financial forecasts that reflect the high degree of uncertainty in the industry. Total cannabis sales in any given calendar year are highly dependent upon progress made - or not made - in each individual state. California is currently the big wild card, as the slow rollout of its statewide regulatory system makes it difficult to get a handle on the exact size of this enormous market. As more information comes to light over time, it could change our estimates for California and, therefore, the industry at large.)
 
Where are the Greatest Market Opportunities?
 
All eyes are on California.
 
That's the reality for nearly everyone involved in the global marijuana market. Companies around the world - from Europe to Canada to Israel and beyond - want a piece of the California market. But there are plenty of practical ramifications. No other state or federal government in the world has tried to implement such a wide-ranging regulatory system that affects tens of thousands of existing black- and gray-market businesses.
 The bottom line: The sheer immensity of the California cannabis market is topped only by its complexity. And that complexity has led to major struggles and big wait times for entrepreneurs looking to tap the California market potential. California's MJ regulatory system covers a population of 40 million and includes incentives for existing businesses to transition to the licit tax-paying industry.
 
There are plenty of other hurdles for existing and future businesses as well, including local license caps from towns and counties that are hesitant to grant permits to any type of cannabis companies. As of early October 2018, only a fraction of local governments had opted to allow rec companies to set up shop within their borders, and state business permits are dependent on a company first obtaining local authorization of some sort. Plenty of companies are striving to play by the rules, but they're often unable to stay in business while doing so because they haven't been able to find locations that fit all the legal parameters for licensing.

The same is true for thousands of small-scale growers in California, as well as edibles makers, concentrate producers and other plant-touching businesses. One option for such companies, at least for now, is to focus on the medical marijuana market instead of rec. Far more local governments allow limited medical companies than adult-use businesses. Obtaining such permits could be a stopgap move, because as time goes on, it's likely that more and more local governments will decide to permit rec. Another option could be to pivot into an alternate cannabis sector, such as distribution or testing labs, given that there's a dearth of both key business types in the state.
 
Hemp and CBD
 
Hemp was once prized for making rope. Two hundred years later, the plant still has us tied in knots. From a patchwork of state hemp rules to confusion among cannabis entrepreneurs about the definition of hemp, uncertainty reigns in the hemp industry. Hemp has long been bedeviled by its conflation with marijuana, and the Controlled Substances Act banned its production for decades. That changed in 2014, when the U.S. Farm Bill opened the door for a hemp revival in states willing to experiment (and control) the crop's return to legal production. The federal government defines hemp as cannabis sativa with a THC content at or below 0.3%.
 
The Farm Bill set off an explosion of hemp production and experimentation and has given cannabis entrepreneurs new opportunities to grow, sell and buy cannabis in a nonintoxicating form. As of October 2018, hemp production is legal under at least limited circumstances in 41 states. The Farm Bill allows limited interstate commerce for hemp - something still off-limits to marijuana entrepreneurs. And hemp businesses report fewer banking and regulatory headaches (though barriers certainly exist in these areas), compared to their marijuana-producing colleagues.
 
The U.S. hemp experiment is still unfolding. Market conditions vary widely. Some states ban all hemp production; others allow some but not all farmers to grow it; and a handful of states invite all farmers to try hemp and even offer to help market the crop and find companies to process it. U.S. agriculture authorities consider hemp legal only if it is grown as part of a state-backed pilot project, so the USDA keeps no records of the nation's nascent hemp industry.
 
Not all U.S. states use the federal THC guidelines to define hemp, and the 0.3% THC threshold has little basis in science, meaning that scientists don't agree how much THC a plant needs to produce a high when heated and consumed. Cannabis plants have more than 100 cannabinoids, of which THC is only one, and hemp products with no detectable THC can still be considered psychoactive if they contain cannabinoids that relieve anxiety or depression. At least one state, Iowa, explicitly dictates that cannabidiol is legal but highTHC marijuana is not legal - then goes on to say it accepts cannabidiol with a THC limit 10 times higher than the federal threshold for legal hemp.
 
Still, the 0.3% THC threshold is a useful metric for dividing marijuana from hemp, and it is the standard used in this Factbook.
 Longtime hemp prohibition in the United States has left the industry frozen in time. There is little modern agricultural equipment appropriate for hemp harvesting and processing, and the crop likely won't match the market share it enjoyed before the Industrial Revolution, when hemp fibers were commonly used in commercial fabrics. Today, hemp's value comes mostly from its flower, rich in cannabinoids beyond THC. The most valuable as of this report is CBD, a cannabinoid with established therapeutic uses including pain relief and reducing muscle spasms associated with epilepsy or muscular sclerosis.
 
Hemp Industry Daily estimates that the U.S. market for hemp-derived CBD will hit approximately $500 million in 2018, with the potential to eclipse $3 billion annually by 2022 - a 500% increase in just four years.
 Expect hemp-derived cannabinoid products low in THC to take increasing market share (and media attention) in the overall cannabis industry.

What Benchmarks could Diego be Measured Against?
 
Diego was one of the first to the market with a real estate holding and branding business model; however, other companies have since adopted similar strategies. Key differentiators between Diego and its competitors are superior branding, optimized build-out and turnkey grow and retail development, pre-negotiated acquisition contracts, and most importantly a branded management company. Table 4 provides a financial benchmark of other cannabis.

Status of Federal Law
 
While marijuana is legal under the laws of several U.S. States, at the present time the concept of “medical marijuana” and “retail marijuana” do not exist under U.S. federal law. The United States Federal Controlled Substance Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug. As defined under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision.
 
The United States Supreme Court has ruled in several cases that the federal government does not violate the federal constitution by regulating and criminalizing cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalizes its use for medicinal and recreational purposes.
 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions' January 2018 decision to rescind the Cole Memo raised some concerns in the marijuana industry that federal officials may try to interfere with legal cannabis. Those concerns, for the most part, haven't materialized, but the scare did get many marijuana businesses thinking about the possibility of federal interference and what could be done about it.
 
The memo was drafted during the Obama administration by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole in 2013 as a way to minimize the threat of federal crackdowns against legal marijuana businesses. The document essentially instructed federal law enforcement not to interfere with state-licensed marijuana businesses complying with state laws and certain conditions, such as not selling product to minors or into the black market.
 
While the Cole Memo clearly expressed an Obama administration policy of leaving legal marijuana businesses alone, it was not a legal change - which only Congress can do. Therefore, the Cole Memo technically allowed U.S. attorneys to go after marijuana businesses if they wanted. With the sending of the Cole Memo to the proverbial shredder, U.S. attorneys no longer have guidelines on how to deal with state-licensed marijuana businesses. But in an April 2018 conversation with Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, President Donald Trump pledged to keep the Department of Justice from interfering with state cannabis laws and, perhaps more significantly, support legislation protecting state-legal marijuana businesses. White House officials later confirmed the president's policy stance.
 
The news is being celebrated by advocates working to reform marijuana laws, but many are wary of taking President Trump at his word as nothing has been codified that would prevent him from reversing course.
 
Several bills have been introduced to Congress seeking to reform federal marijuana laws in different ways, including the removal of cannabis from the list of controlled substances, allowing MJ companies to access traditional banking services and amending the IRS code to more fairly tax cannabis businesses. Similar bills have been introduced in previous sessions of Congress, but none have gained significant traction. This time, however, may be different, as marijuana reform has become a bipartisan issue that has the support of many prominent Republicans.
 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, introduced a bill in April to remove federal barriers on hemp, while former Republican House Speaker John Boehner recently disclosed his involvement with a large, multistate cannabis company.
 
Whether any significant reform of federal marijuana policy happens in 2018 and what shape it could take remains an open question, but it's clear that attitudes toward cannabis on Capitol Hill are shifting.
