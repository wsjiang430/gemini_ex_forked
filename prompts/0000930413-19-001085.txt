References to “we”, “us”, “our”, “REX” or “the Company” refer to REX American Resources Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries.
 
Fiscal Year
 
All references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to REX’s fiscal year ended January 31. For example, “fiscal year 2018” means the period February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019. We refer to our fiscal year by reference to the year immediately preceding the January 31 fiscal year end date.
Overview
 
REX was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as a holding company. Our principal offices are located at 7720 Paragon Road, Dayton, Ohio 45459. Our telephone number is (937) 276-3931. We have been an investor in ethanol production facilities beginning in 2006. We are currently invested in three ethanol production entities; we have a majority ownership interest in two of these entities. We also own a majority interest in an entity that owns and operates a refined coal facility. We may make additional investments in the energy or other industries in the future. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we began reporting the results of our refined coal operation as a new segment as a result of the August 10, 2017 acquisition of an entity that operates a refined coal facility (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to the acquisition, we had one reportable segment, ethanol. Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we have two reportable segments: i) ethanol and by-products and ii) refined coal.

Our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and natural gas. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially. The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. Because the market prices of ethanol and distillers grains are not always directly related to corn prices, at times ethanol and/or distillers grains prices may lag movements in corn prices. In an environment of higher corn prices or lower ethanol/distillers grains prices, the overall margin structure at the plants could be reduced. As a result, at times, we may operate our plants at negative or minimally positive operating margins.
 
We expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 2.8 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle. We refer to the actual gallons of denatured ethanol produced per bushel of grain processed as the realized yield. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain (divided by the realized yield) as the “crush spread.” Should the crush spread decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants.
 
We attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of commodity prices by utilizing forward grain purchase, forward ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil sale contracts and commodity futures agreements as management deems appropriate. We attempt to match quantities of these sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot market with respect to ethanol price. Consequently, we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than four months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future contracts, in conjunction with certain of our grain procurement activities.
 
Commodity prices in fiscal year 2018 were subject to significant volatility. For fiscal year 2018, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) near-month corn price ranged from a low of approximately $3.40 per bushel in July 2018 to a high of approximately $4.08 per bushel in May 2018. Corn prices were impacted throughout the year from consecutive strong corn harvests in 2017 and 2018. Ethanol prices had significant fluctuations ranging from a low of approximately $1.20 per gallon in November 2018 to a high of approximately $1.53 per gallon in March 2018. Ethanol prices were influenced by many factors throughout the year including domestic demand, record exports and increases in U.S. ethanol production. Ethanol prices in 2018 were negatively impacted, in part, by increased small refiner waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the resulting reductions to the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) obligations and ethanol demand.
 
On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through a 95.35% owned subsidiary, for approximately $12.0 million the entire ownership interest of an entity that owns a refined coal facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. We expect that the refined coal operating results will be subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In order to maintain compliance with Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code, we are required to test every six months, through an independent laboratory, the effectiveness of our process with respect to emissions reductions. Annually, the IRS publishes the amount

of federal income tax credit earned per ton of refined coal produced and sold for a given calendar year, which for 2018 is $7.03 per ton.
 
Net income attributable to REX common shareholders was approximately $31.6 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to approximately $39.7 million in fiscal year 2017. The current year benefitted from reductions in our effective tax rate resulting from the impact of federal production tax credits associated with our refined coal operations and from the impact of research and experimentation credits associated with our ethanol and by-products operations. Fiscal year 2017 benefitted from the impact of tax reform legislation as we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities at a significantly lower tax rate. Gross profit in fiscal year 2018 was significantly lower compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily a result of lower ethanol crush spreads and the impact of our refined coal facility which generated a gross loss for a full year of operations in fiscal year 2018 compared to a partial year of operations in fiscal year 2017. Due to the inherent volatility of commodity prices within the ethanol industry, the uncertainty regarding future refined coal production and associated financial results, we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the fiscal year 2018 results.
 
During fiscal year 2013, we entered into a joint venture with Hytken HPGP LLC (“Hytken”) to file and defend patents for eSteam technology relating to heavy oil and oil sands production methods, and to attempt to commercially exploit the technology to generate license fees, royalty income and development opportunities. The patented technology is an enhanced method of heavy oil recovery involving zero emissions downhole steam generation. To date, we have paid approximately $2.0 million to purchase our ownership interest and fund patent and other expenses. We have not successfully demonstrated that the technology is commercially feasible. We own 60% and Hytken owns 40% of the entity named Future Energy, LLC (“Future Energy”), an Ohio limited liability company. Future Energy is managed by a board of three managers, two appointed by us and one by Hytken.
 
We plan to seek and evaluate various investment opportunities including energy related, agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities.
 
Ethanol and by-products Overview
 
We began investing in the ethanol industry during fiscal year 2006. The form and structure of our investments is tailored to the specific needs and goals of each project and the local farmer group or investor with whom we are partnering. We generally participate in the management of our projects through our membership on the board of managers of the limited liability companies that own the plants.

Ethanol Industry
 
Ethanol is a renewable fuel source produced by processing corn and other biomass through a fermentation process that creates combustible alcohol that can be used as an additive or replacement to fossil fuel based gasoline. The majority of ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because of its wide availability and ease of convertibility from large amounts of carbohydrates into glucose, the key ingredient in producing alcohol that is used in the fermentation process. Ethanol production can also use feedstocks such as grain sorghum, switchgrass, wheat, barley, potatoes and sugarcane as carbohydrate sources. Most ethanol plants have been located near large corn production areas, such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Railway access and interstate access are vital for ethanol facilities due to the large amount of raw materials and finished goods required to be shipped to and from the ethanol plant facilities.
 
According to the Renewable Fuels Association (“RFA”), the United States ethanol industry produced an estimated 16.1 billion gallons of ethanol in 2018. Approximately 14.5 billion gallons were blended domestically and approximately 1.7 billion gallons were exported in 2018. According to the RFA, as of January 2019, the United States ethanol industry consists of 210 plants (199 operating) in 27 states with an annual capacity of approximately 16.5 billion gallons (approximately 16.0 billion gallons at operating plants) of ethanol production. The RFA estimates that, as of January 2019, approximately 350 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion.
 
On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “Energy Act of 2007”) was enacted. The Energy Act of 2007 established new levels of renewable fuel mandates, including two different categories of renewable fuels: conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. Corn-based ethanol is considered a conventional biofuel which is subject to a renewable fuel standard (“RFS”) of 15.0 billion gallons annually through 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes will be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture.
 
The federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II, established in October 2010. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the EPA took action to reduce the volumes for both conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels.

The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017, in favor of the Americans for Clean Energy and its petitioners against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements. The Court concluded the EPA erred in how it interpreted the “inadequate domestic supply” waiver provision of RFS II, which authorizes the EPA to consider supply-side factors affecting the volume of renewable fuel available to refiners, blenders, and importers to meet the statutory volume requirements. The waiver provision does not allow the EPA to consider the volume of renewable fuel available to consumers or the demand-side constraints that affect the consumption of renewable fuel by consumers. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2016 through its waiver authority, which the EPA is expected to address.
 
Pursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol was maintained at 15.0 billion gallons, 2019 is the second consecutive year the total proposed renewable volume obligations (“RVOs”) are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemaking process and the EPA will modify statutory volumes through 2022 based upon the same factors used to set the post 2022 RVOs. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure, consumer costs, job creation, agriculture commodities, food prices and rural economic development.
 
Obligated parties use renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. Certain obligated parties petitioned the EPA to move the point of obligation from refiners and importers of fuel to fuel blenders. In November 2017, the EPA denied this petition to change the point of obligation under RFS II to the parties that own the gasoline before it is sold. In March 2019, the EPA sent reform measures to the White House to control speculation in RIN values by barring trading from non-industry participants, publicizing large RIN positions, limiting the length of time a non-obligated party can hold RINs and increasing the compliance frequency to quarterly rather than annually.
 
On January 26, 2018, in separate court actions, both Valero Energy and American Fuel and Petrochemical and Manufacturers challenged the EPA regarding the EPA’s management of the U.S. biofuel mandate. Amongst their challenges are the EPA’s November 2017 decision to reject proposed changes to the structure of the RFS including the point of obligation, and the plaintiffs are seeking a review of the annual Renewable Volume Obligations rule set by the EPA for 2018 and 2019.
 
Under the RFS II, a small refiner that processes less than 75,000 barrels per day can petition the EPA for a waiver of their requirement to submit RINs. The EPA, through consultation with the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, can grant the refiner a full or partial waiver, or deny the waiver. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers for 2016 and 2017 than they had for previous years, totaling approximately 2.6 billion gallons of waived requirement for the two years combined. This effectively reduced the RFS II mandated volumes for those compliance years by those waived amounts, and has lowered RIN values significantly over the past calendar year.
 
Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. circuit, challenging the 2019 RVO rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rulemaking. This is the first RFS rulemaking since the expanded use of the exemptions came to light. To date, the EPA has refused to cap the number of waivers it grants or how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its percentage standard calculations. Even if all the obligated parties comply with their respective percentage obligations for 2019, the country’s overall supply of renewable fuel will not meet the total volume requirements set by the EPA. Biofuels groups argue the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future.

Ethanol Production
 
The plants we have invested in are designed to use the dry milling method of producing ethanol. In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred to as “meal,” and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. The meal is processed with enzymes, chemicals and water, and then placed in a high-temperature cooker. It is then transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol begins. After fermentation, the resulting liquid is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining “stillage” for fuel uses. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with a denaturant, such as natural gasoline, to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. With the starch elements of the corn consumed in the above described process, the principal co-product produced by the dry milling process is dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS. DDGS is sold as a protein used in animal feed, which recovers a portion of the corn cost not absorbed in ethanol production. Depending on market and operating conditions, we may also sell modified distillers grains or wet distillers grains by removing less liquid content compared to DDGS. We also generate revenues from the sale of non-food grade corn oil produced at our facilities. Non-food grade corn oil is sold to the animal feed market, as well as biodiesel and other chemical markets.
The Primary Uses of Ethanol
 
Blend component. Today, much of the ethanol blending in the U.S. is done to meet the RFS. Most regular gasoline is produced using blendstock with an octane rating of 84, which is then increased to 87 (the minimum octane rating required in most states) by adding 10% ethanol according to the RFA. The industry is attempting to expand the E-85 market, as well as to raise the federal cap on ethanol blend above the current 10% for most vehicles in use. The EPA has approved the use of 15% ethanol (“E-15”) in gasoline for cars, SUV’s and light duty trucks made in 2001 and later. However, the EPA did not grant E-15 the same vapor pressure waiver as E-10 so it can only currently be sold from September 16 through May 31 for those vehicles in most markets. On March 12, 2019, the EPA issued a proposed rule to remove the summer ban. The proposed rule is subject to a public hearing and comments.
 
Clean air additive. Ethanol is employed by the refining industry as a fuel oxygenate, which when blended with gasoline, allows engines to combust fuel more completely and reduce emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. Oxygenated gasoline is used to help meet certain federal and air emission standards.
 
Octane enhancer. Ethanol increases the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. As such, ethanol is used by gasoline suppliers as an octane enhancer both for producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and for upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades.
 
Legislation
 
The United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of legislation affecting the U.S. ethanol industry.

Refined Coal Overview
 
On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through a 95.35% owned subsidiary, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owns a refined coal facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. Using licensed technology, our plant applies two separate chemicals to convert feedstock coal into refined coal, which is sold to the end user of the refined coal. We expect that the refined coal operating results will be subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). In order to maintain compliance with Section 45 of the IRC, we are required to test every six months, through an independent laboratory, the effectiveness of our process with respect to emissions reductions. Annually, the IRS publishes the amount of federal income tax credit earned per ton of refined coal produced and sold for a given calendar year, which for 2018 is $7.03 per ton.
 
Section 45 of the IRC was created by Congress to encourage the development and use of environmentally sound solutions to control harmful emissions during energy production and to facilitate and move the United States towards better compliance with global environmental energy standards. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended Section 45 of the IRC by adding provisions to incentivize the production of emission reducing refined coal. To qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the IRC, a process must reduce coal emissions of nitrogen oxide by 20% and either sulfur dioxide or mercury by 40%. The tax credits can be earned for refined coal produced and sold by our facility through November 2021.
 
Facilities
 
At January 31, 2019, our consolidated ethanol entities own a combined 477 acres of land and two facilities that shipped a combined quantity of approximately 286 million gallons of ethanol in fiscal year 2018. We also own our corporate headquarters office building, consisting of approximately 7,500 square feet, located in Dayton, Ohio. We own a refined coal plant that is located on leased property on the site of an electrical generating station.
Employees
 
At January 31, 2019, we had 127 employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We expect this employment level to remain relatively stable. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Service Marks
 
We have registered the service marks “REX”, and “Farmer’s Energy”, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks.
