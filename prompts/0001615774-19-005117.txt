Item 1. Business
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Reign Sapphire Corp. (“Reign”) (OTCQB: RGNP) was established on December 15, 2014 in the State of Delaware and is a Beverly Hills-based, direct-to consumer (“D2C”) branded and custom jewelry company with four niche brands: Reign Sapphires: ethically produced, millennial targeted sapphire jewelry, Coordinates Collection: custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life’s special moments, Le Bloc: classic customized jewelry and ION Collection, an athleisure jewelry brand.
 
CCI, previously known as FD9 Group, Inc., markets and distributes classic custom jewelry through Le Bloc and custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life’s special moments through Coordinates Collection. CCI was organized as a Delaware corporation in 2013 and is currently based in Los Angeles, California.
 
On December 1, 2016, substantially all of the operating assets of CCI were acquired by Reign, (see “Acquisition of Assets Related to the Coordinates Collection Business”). As part of the Acquisition, we created a wholly owned subsidiary, Reign Brands, which acted as the operating entity for the acquired CCI assets.
 
Subsequent to the acquisition of CCI’s assets, we had four niche brands: Reign Sapphires: ethically produced, source-to-consumer sapphire jewelry targeting millennials, Coordinates Collection: custom jewelry, inscribed with location coordinates commemorating life’s special moments, Le Bloc: classic customized jewelry and athleisure jewelry brand ION Collection.
 
On January 1, 2019, Reign Brands, Inc., a subsidiary of Reign Sapphire Corporation, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Co-Op Jewelers LLC (“Co-Op”), whereby Reign Brands, Inc. sold operating assets of Reign Brands, Inc., consisting of substantially all of the assets related to Coordinates Collection (“CC”). On January 1, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the parties executed the Asset Purchase Agreement and the final exhibits.
 
Upon the closing of the Agreement, Reign Brands, Inc. sold substantially all of the operating assets of the CC business, consisting of fixed assets and intellectual property in exchange for an aggregate of $100,000 in cash.
 
Reign Sapphires
 
Reign Sapphires was established as a vertically integrated “source to retail” model for sapphires--rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires. We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.
 
Our core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our jewelry collections.
 
Strategy
 
Reign Sapphires 
 
We set ourselves apart from our competition by actively promoting our three core offerings: a vertically integrated “source to retail” model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.
 
We promote Reign Sapphires as conflict free, ethically processed and natural. We also make video footage and pictures of the process available to consumers.

We focus primarily on quality and design and secondly on strategic pricing methods in order to compete in the U.S. market.
 
While all of our competitors have established themselves uniquely within sectors of the market, none have marketed themselves as source to consumer with a vertical integration of processing, cutting and shaping, manufacturing, and sales of sapphires. We believe there is a strong market opportunity for our products as there is currently growth in U.S. and global jewelry sales. We believe that we have the knowledge and expertise to capitalize on this opportunity and to capitalize upon the uniquely powerful internationally recognized Australian brand image and appeal and become the leading player in this fragmented cottage industry.
 
Products 
 
Our product lines consist of rings, bracelets, necklaces. When sapphires are used in the products, they are predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut melees.
 
Aspects of processing, manufacturing and sales: 
 

● | Gem Shaping, Cutting, & Processing for our Reign Sapphire products: Our contract gem design team cut, shape, and process rough sapphire material into gem stones. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Jewelry Manufacturing: We outsource the manufacturing to a quality provider. 
● | Packaging: Each jewelry item is accompanied by a high quality, durable jewelry box, gift bag, certificate of authenticity and warranty. 
● | Our Reign Sapphire products feature sapphires that have been procured in the rough from commercial miners in New South Wales, Australia and processed by us. We do not have an exclusive supplier rather a number of commercial miners in the region that have been supplying the company with run-of-mine material for a number of years.

 
We do not rely on any principal suppliers and do not have any formal contracts with our suppliers. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of our suppliers, we believe that a number of alternative sources will be available to us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.
 
Market Overview
 
Opportunities
 
Demand for the industry’s products is largely driven by the needs and preferences of consumers, along with variations in the level of disposable income allocated toward their purchases.
 
The primary audience for our brands is women, in general. However, while women may make the choices, men often oversee the purchase. Speaking to both women and men is an important aspect of any program. There are 3 main stages of life where a jewelry purchase will come into play:
 

● | Single “The Self Purchaser” 
--+-----------------------------------------------------
● | Married (Engagement/Wedding/Children - Push Present)
● | Retired (Gift Giver) 

 
More specific age segmentation within these life stages includes:
 

● | 18-25 coming of age/first job 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 25-35 career development/children 
● | 35-45 family/career advancement (self-purchaser) 
● | 45-55 self-actualization/empty nest (gift giver to self and others)

 
An example of women’s networks and influencers include:
 

● | Friends (word-of-mouth) 
--+--------------------------------------------
● | Celebrities (aspirational) 
● | Bloggers/online platforms (trusted network)

● | Media (3rd party endorsement)

Understanding how the various targets receive information and are influenced in making jewelry purchases helps direct various streams of communication.

Marketing Overview & Strategy
 
We focus our marketing initiatives on: (1) D2C ecommerce marketing to attract customers to our websites, (2) Business-to-Business (“B2B”) marketing and sales efforts, to establish domestic and international distribution partners such as high-end fashion retailers.
 
On a D2C basis, we use an array of marketing methods to spread awareness of our jewelry products, including a mobile app, social media, internet marketing, print advertising, promotions and collaborations.
 
We will continue to form limited wholesale partnerships with retailers to sell our products at their retail boutiques, the benefit to us is the promotion of our brands at the consumer level.
 
Branding Strategy
 
Branding plays a critical role in our success.
 
We have performed marketing and capabilities landscape assessments based upon consumer immersion and research and designed to understand consumer purchase behaviors and values, assess short and long term socio-cultural and market trends, and analyze the marketplace and competitive landscape.
 
We have developed comprehensive, consumer-oriented toolkit using consistent language and tone for printed and online media and to target retailers on a sell-in, exclusive basis.
 
We develop advertisements for print and online media, and sales materials for retail strategic partners. We maintain a graphics library to be used on all touch points.
 
Social Media
 
Our marketing team works on several social media initiatives that target current and future consumers and support the promotion and sale of our product brands. Our campaigns are focused on driving a consistent message emphasizing the ethical origins of our products, their everlasting beauty, and overall value. We use various forms of digital and social media outreach to accomplish greater awareness of the value proposition we offer.
Internet Marketing
 
We maintain presence on Google, Bing, Yahoo and all other online search engines that are used to search for jewelry and sapphires. We engage in significant search engine optimization marketing efforts to ensure that we have strong results upon natural searches related to our products. We utilize pay per click advertising, display advertising, and article marketing. Our websites display a full catalogue of our products, background information regarding the manufacturing of the products, information about the Company and management team, and contact information. We also maintain a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media websites to have an interactive presence.

We have developed a retail channel strategy to bolster the retail/direct to consumer sales approach while maintain a point of differentiation within the competitive landscape. Furthermore, we have developed retail adaptation strategies using in-store promotional and retail tactics using our branding strategy.
 
Public Relations
 
We engage in activities to gain public awareness and credibility through our internally managed public relations (“PR”) campaigns to establish relationships with the local market. We attend editor events and engage in strategic media outreach planning and strive to be a valued member of the community through community service offerings and support. work to obtain interviews, print articles, and featured spots in leading fashion, luxury, and bridal magazines, industry publications, television news, radio programming, periodicals, and online websites and publications. We have developed short-lead and long-lead editorials and long lead editorials. The purpose of the PR campaign is to highlight the strength and innovation of our products.
Promotions
 
We activate promotional platforms to include sales during and after holidays, discounted prices on particular products, and discounts for repeat customers.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the holiday season. Our sales to support the holiday season largely have taken place during the fourth calendar quarter; however, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution, these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.
 
Competition 
 
Competitive Analysis and Strategy
 
The industry in which we compete is highly competitive. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry include the ability to control as much as possible of the supply chain.
 
We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong ecommerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust & recognition. However, we set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.
 
Because we are a small company with a limited operating history, we are at a competitive disadvantage against larger and well-capitalized companies which have a track record of success and operations. Therefore, our primary method of competition involves promoting our direct to consumer offering.
 
We do not sell rough sapphires neither do we sell the cut stones that we process; we generally use the material exclusively for our manufacturing purposes. Wholesale revenues currently derived from sales of loose sapphires are attributable only to finished stones and not rough sapphires and the focus of our sales efforts in the future will be exclusively on finished jewelry.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Reign owns trademarks in the jewelry and gemstone class including “Reign”, “Reign Opulence”, “LeBloc”, and we also own a number of domain names.
 
Governmental Approvals and Regulation
 
We do not require any government approval in order to operate our business. In the event any of our operations or products requires government approval, we will comply with any and all local, state and federal requirements.

Other than federal and state securities laws and common business and tax rules and regulations, we are not subject to any material government regulation. However, there is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Procurement and Manufacturing
 
At the present time, all of our manufacturing is outsourced. We have no formal contracts with our suppliers and manufacturers. In the event that we are unable to conduct business on satisfactory terms with any of these suppliers or manufacturers, we believe that an extensive number of alternative sources will be available to us and that our business can continue without disruption or adverse change in terms of pricing and availability.
Research and Development
 
Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, we may elect to initiate research and development activities, but we have no plans for any activities to date.
