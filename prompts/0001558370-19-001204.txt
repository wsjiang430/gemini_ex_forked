     Item 1. Business
     Overview
     Teladoc Health, Inc. is the largest and most trusted global leader of comprehensive virtual healthcare services. We are forging a new healthcare experience with better convenience, outcomes and value. Our mission is to transform how people access healthcare, delivering an improved experience with better convenience, outcomes and value for individuals, providers and Clients. We provide virtual access to high-quality care and expertise, with a portfolio of services and solutions covering 450 medical subspecialties from non-urgent, episodic needs like flu and upper respiratory infections, to chronic, complicated medical conditions like cancer and congestive heart failure. By combining the latest in data and analytics with an award-winning user experience through a highly flexible technology platform, we completed approximately 2.6 million telehealth visits in 2018 for patients around the globe. 

    Over 22.8 million unique U.S. paid Members and 9.5 million visit fee only individuals have access to our high-quality healthcare and expertise. Through our acquisition of Advance Medical Health-Care Management Services, S.A. (Advance Medical) in 2018, we now deliver services in more than 130 countries around the world in more than 20 languages. We provide access to healthcare through our portfolio of five consumer brands 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. Our solutions are delivered with an approximate median response time of less than ten minutes in the U.S. for general medical inquiries from the time a Member requests a general medical telehealth visit to the time they consult with a Teladoc Health network provider.
    
Who We Serve
     We currently provide virtual healthcare services on a business-to-business (B2B) basis to more than 12,000 total Clients spanning the global healthcare distribution landscape and provide services to consumers directly and through channel partners. In our behavioral health business, branded BetterHelp, we serve individuals in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) market and through business partnerships with other trusted brands. Teladoc Health employers, health plans, hospitals and health systems, insurance and financial services companies and consumers (Clients) purchase our solutions to reduce their healthcare spending, or to provide market differentiating services as either part of, or a complement to, their core set of consumer service offerings, while at the same time, offering convenient, affordable, high-quality healthcare to their audiences.
    
We have over 40 health plan Clients, including some of the largest in the United States such as Aetna, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, Premera and United Healthcare. While health plans are Clients, they also serve as distribution channels to self-insured employers that contract with us through our relationships with them. We work with more than 70 global insurance and financial services firms, such as AIG, AXA Global, Great West Life and MLC.
    
We serve more than 300 hospital and health system Clients, including prestigious organizations such as Jefferson Partners Healthcare. 
    
Our employer Clients include over 40% of the Fortune 500 companies. The remainder of our Clients are from channel partners such as brokers, resellers and consultants who sell into a range of small, medium and large enterprises.
     We formed an important D2C enterprise partnership with CVS to be their virtual care provider, a rollout that began in the fourth quarter and will continue throughout 2019.
     Our virtual solutions delivered through all of our channels offer our Clients proven substantial savings opportunities and an attractive return on investment. We commissioned Veracity Analytics, an independent healthcare data analytics company, to perform a study of several Clients representing nearly two million of our Members as of the end of 2016. To date, we believe this is the most comprehensive study of its kind and the findings remain valid based on our experience with our Clients. The study found that these Clients saved $472 on average per general medical visit

when its Members received healthcare through Teladoc Health instead of receiving healthcare in other settings for the same diagnosis. 
     The Teladoc Health Brand Portfolio 
     Our consumer brands – Teladoc, Advance Medical, Best Doctors, BetterHelp and HealthiestYou - deliver access to advice and resolution to a broad array of healthcare needs, in intuitive, award-winning experiences designed to meet the expectations of today’s consumers, from young adults to the senior population. The most common way for individuals to request healthcare is by using a mobile device, reflecting the growing consumer adoption of mobile technology and applications in managing their health.      How We Generate Revenue
     We generate revenue on a contractually recurring, subscription access fee basis, typically on a per-Member-per-month (PMPM) basis, and in certain contracts, on a per subscriber basis. Our subscription access fees comprise the majority of our revenue and therefore provide us with significant revenue visibility. We also generate additional revenue on a per-visit basis through certain Clients with visit fee only (VFO) arrangements. 
     Subscription access fees are paid by our Clients on behalf of their employees, dependents, policy holders, card holders, beneficiaries or, as is the case with certain of our subscribers, fees are paid by our Members themselves. General medical and other specialty visit fees are paid by Clients and/or Members. 
     For certain Clients, we also earn visit fees or per-case fees in combination with subscription access fees.  Subscription access fee services continue to be the most appealing to our Clients due to the proven effectiveness of our engagement science and surround sound strategies driving utilization of our services. In 2018, we continued to experience strong demand for our subscription access fee services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 84% and 16% of our revenue was derived from subscription access fees and visit fees, respectively.  
     Global Market Opportunities
     We believe that favorable macro trends, in combination with the expansion of our capabilities, present significant opportunities for virtual healthcare to address the most pressing, universal healthcare challenges through trusted solutions, such as ours, that match consumer demand and physician supply at the time of need. 
     Barriers and inefficiencies in healthcare systems around the world present market participants with major global challenges such as: 
    
(i) | consumers lack sufficient access to high‑quality, cost‑effective healthcare at appropriate sites of care, while bearing an increasing share of costs;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | employers and health plans lack effective solutions that reduce costs while enhancing healthcare access for beneficiaries;
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | health systems lack effective solutions to manage supply/demand gaps driven by physician demographics, burn out and aging baby boomers; and
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | providers lack flexibility to increase productivity by delivering healthcare on their own terms.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Traditional market participants are therefore increasingly unable to effectively and efficiently receive, deliver or administer healthcare. At the same time, the emergence of technology platforms solving massive structural challenges in other industries has highlighted the need for similar solutions in healthcare. Teladoc Health offers solution to address these challenges.
     Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe that Teladoc Health is the leading global virtual healthcare provider with strong competitive advantages that address the most pressing challenges and trends in the delivery of healthcare around the world. We 

 
  3

 
believe our history of innovation and long-standing operational excellence provide us with significant first-mover advantages, and we continue to invest and expand our services and geographic footprint globally. As the first comprehensive virtual healthcare provider at scale, we have pioneered solutions and created what we believe are collectively, the telehealth industry’s first and only offerings of their kind.
     Comprehensive Suite of Virtual Healthcare Clinical Services
     We believe that we are the first and only company to provide a comprehensive and integrated virtual healthcare solution covering a full spectrum of clinical conditions – from non-critical, episodic care to chronic, complicated cases – as well as a wide range of services, such as telehealth solutions, expert medical services, behavioral health solutions, guidance and support, and platform & program services.
     Our proprietary platform enables patients and our providers (Providers) to have an integrated, smart user experience, through mobile, web, and phone based accessed points. Our new virtual health assistant leverages natural language processing, patient and group specific information, clinical guidelines, and learning algorithms to make finding the right virtual health service even easier for our Members at their moment of need. We have seen increasing adoption of multiple products by our Clients, with Clients representing over 40% of U.S. Membership now subscribing to 2 or more products. As a result of our analytics driven member engagement, our utilization is approximately four times better than the industry averages.
     Global Footprint Spanning Clients, Medical Operations and Members
 With our acquisition of Advance Medical in 2018, we built on our successful track record of acquiring and integrating companies with common purpose, complementary capabilities and access to new markets. We believe we have the only global footprint spanning a diverse set of client channels, medical operations and Members. Combining Advance Medical’s suite of international clinical capabilities with our technology and operational scale uniquely equips us to meet the needs of U.S. multinational employers that serve more than one third of their employees who live abroad. 
 We have more than 20 offices globally servicing patients from more than 130 countries and can deliver care in more than 30 languages. 
     Unmatched Breadth of Solutions for Clients Across All Channels Served 
     We deliver a comprehensive set of solutions to a diverse Client population through a highly efficient and effective distribution network wherein we reach consumers on a direct B2B basis through our Clients and channel partners as well on a D2C basis by marketing our solution directly to potential paid Members. 
     On a direct B2B basis, we sell to our Clients who in turn buy our solutions on behalf of their beneficiaries. In our various sales channels, a range of third-parties, including health plans, financial institutions, brokers, agents, benefits consultants and resellers, sell our solutions to various end markets around the world. Notably, many of our health plan Clients also act as channel partners because they resell our solutions to their Administrative Service Only (ASO) accounts and other customers. Similarly, our financial services Clients act as channel partners, embedding our solutions into a range of insurance, credit card and other financial products.
     In the hospital and health systems market, we sell our solutions directly to provider entities who leverage our platform to deliver virtual healthcare to both new and existing patients. We have a growing presence in D2C markets, where we primarily focus on general telehealth visits and behavioral health. We believe the breadth of our distribution strategy allows us to directly reach consumers and Clients of nearly every size and in nearly every market.  
     Comprehensive Engagement Model that Drives Utilization 
     We believe that our ability to drive behavior change on a global scale to deliver the highest utilization of virtual healthcare services in the industry is a key competitive differentiator for Teladoc Health. We utilize a combination of 

 
  4

 
engagement science, our Surround Sound capabilities as well as our deep knowledge and expertise of various populations to increase the adoption of our virtual care services. 
    
The National Business Group on Health 2018 Large Employer Health Care Strategy and Plan Design Survey cites average telehealth utilization amongst large employers at 2.5% while the Teladoc Health average U.S. utilization (excluding Amerigroup and Visit Fee Only Members) was almost four times the national average in 2018 at 9.4%. 
     Our Engagement Science is a unique combination of the application of predictive analytics and modeling, our deep experience with all population demographics and expertise in applying this knowledge to our Client populations on a global scale. With our proprietary Engagement Science, we target Members using behavioral triggers, advanced predictive modeling and demographic/firmographic insights. This increases efficiency and the impact of our communications by reaching the right Member, with the right personalized message, in the right micro moments of their day-to-day lives. We were the first to implement sophisticated behavioral analytics and predictive modeling to drive utilization across our full portfolio of clinical services which are especially critical for more complex health conditions.
     We believe that our Surround Sound capabilities are unique in the breadth and scale of media mix, analytics and targeting techniques that we actively deploy across our diverse client populations on a global scale. We use these capabilities, plus our Engagement Science, to drive awareness and utilization of Teladoc Health services through innovative media strategies designed to reach Members in their homes, on the go and in their moments of need. Our Surround Sound capabilities and strategies are continuously being evaluated, analyzed and evolved to meet ever-shifting consumer behaviors.
     In addition to our proactive engagement techniques, we also provide our Clients with on-line access to our Teladoc Health Engagement Center for client specific, fully customized engagement collateral on a self-service basis.  We believe that we are the only partner globally that provides our business-to-business-to-consumer Clients across all market channels with the breadth and dynamic customization of our proprietary online portal. The Teladoc Health Engagement Center has experienced strong Client adoption, with more than 83,000 logins in 2018.
     Highly Scalable and Secure API-Driven Technology Platform
     We are tackling access, cost and quality of healthcare challenges for our Clients through our technology platform that dynamically and efficiently match our Member’s demand and our Provider’s availability real-time, asynchronously and in various modalities such as video, web, mobile and telephone. 
     Our integrated, flexible, purpose-built solution positions us at the center of the patient, provider and payor relationship and as a key participant in the highly complex healthcare industry. We believe our technology platform contains several differentiating features. 
     We believe we were the first to build a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface or API-driven technology platform, for virtual healthcare delivery, with multiple real-time integrations spanning the healthcare ecosystem.
     We have a highly scalable platform that is currently equipped to serve over 100 million Members.
     Our platform can provide the same level of Member support and response time for upwards of 50,000 visits per day versus our December 2018 rate of over 7,000 visits per day, on average. Further, our platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services and products that we have introduced, such as behavioral health, dermatology, expert medical opinions, global healthcare, and other services that are currently in the development stages. 
     We pride ourselves on what we believe is unmatched integration with the payor community that enables us to uniquely provide real-time eligibility checking, real-time Member financial liability calculations and clinical data exchange.
    
 
  5

 

 Our platform’s APIs power external connectivity and deep integration with a wide range of payors, third party applications and other interfaces which uniquely positions us to be a central partner meeting the unique needs of the rapidly emerging, technology powered healthcare industry.
     We believe that we have the only platform that incorporates the core functionality required to offer a full spectrum of virtual healthcare services on a single system. Our platform features predictive modeling, automated complex routing, queuing and scheduling.
     Consumers benefit from our ability to customize their experience to meet their unique needs.  They can manage their own electronic medical records, (EMRs). We also provide access to a secure message center, provider finder, image upload capability and enable real-time sharing capabilities with providers that include visit scheduling, a single sign on and full interoperability with native iOS and Android apps. 
     Our Providers benefit from a dedicated, easy to use mobile app, EMR and visit queue, proprietary telehealth guidelines, e prescribing and a range of other features and functions such as auto complete symptoms, diagnoses and billing codes. 
     To meet the growing needs of hospitals and health systems, as well as multi-national insurers, our proprietary licensed platform enables Clients to fully integrate private instances of our platform alongside their traditional modes of delivering healthcare to their patients. Leveraging the flexibility and customization available on the platform, most of these implementations incorporate deep integration with the hospital or health system’s EMR platform for scheduling and bi-directional clinical data sharing.
    
High-Quality Clinical Capabilities Tailored Virtual Care 
     We deliver high-quality clinical care and advice in a virtual setting to our Members through the unique combination of our proprietary guidelines, breadth and depth of clinical quality data, analytics, oversight as well as through our in-house and third-party medical professionals (our Medical Group). 
     The Medical Group is composed of staff clinicians, our telehealth provider network and the Teladoc Health Expert Panel. Overseeing the Medical Group we have a Quality and Care and Patient Safety sub-committee of our Board of Directors, chaired by Senator Bill Frist, M.D. We also have a global network of medical advisory boards, spanning North America, Europe, and Australia.  
     With our telehealth provider network, we believe that by directly recruiting, credentialing, training and contracting with our Providers we have built our clinical capabilities in a manner that supports the operational complexity of and commitment to clinical quality required in delivery of care in a virtual setting. We provide expert medical services through a combination of our Teladoc Health Expert Panel, as well as in house health professionals. Our Teladoc Health Expert Panel is composed of a network of approximately 50,000 medical experts around the world whose specialties span 450 sub-specialties and are affiliated with some of the most prestigious medical facilities in the world. 
     To improve the clinical quality our patients receive, we apply analytics to the anonymized data points generated in our millions of visits with patients, these data sets and insights are applied to enhancing our Providers ability to deliver quality care through tools such as our Provider dashboards, as well as serving a foundation for clinical innovation, collaborating with leaders in the space, focused on the advancement of virtual care delivery and practices. 
     To deliver virtual care spanning the comprehensive suite of clinical services that Teladoc Health offers, we have pioneered the development of a new clinical specialty, the Virtualist, which is in the early stages of development. We have partnered with Thomas Jefferson University to offer a fellowship focused on the training of future leaders in virtual care. Additionally, as part of our successful antibiotic prescribing stewardship program, we have undertaken a five-year, grant-funded research study together with the University of Southern California (USC) Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics and Northwestern University, to lead the first-ever, large-scale study to assess antibiotic prescribing practices in telehealth. This project is funded through a grant from the Department of Health and Human Services'

Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and as part of the White House’s National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB). This study is expected to set a new precedent in medical literature by adding specific standards for telehealth and virtual care. 
     Our Growth Strategies
     The following are our key growth strategies.
     Enable A Virtual First Strategy for Consumer Healthcare Access
     Teladoc Health is creating a new virtual front door for consumers to access the healthcare system. As we drive the world to a “Virtual First” mindset, we believe only Teladoc Health has the enterprise scale, technical capabilities, clinical depth, and consumer engagement expertise to achieve the vision. We refer to Teladoc Health’s integrated offering as our comprehensive Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform. 
     Teladoc Health’s Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform is changing consumer behavior to where consumers access virtual healthcare as their first point of entry into the healthcare system for a wide range of their healthcare needs. We are creating a new virtual front door, providing simple access to powerful healthcare solutions for consumers. We are delivering a single solution leveraging our comprehensive clinical expertise, to address the complete spectrum of conditions from non-critical, episodic care to chronic, complicated cases. The Virtual First model is built on our integrated Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform, combining smart technologies and AI, rich data exchange, Analytics and scalability to streamline care and drive better outcomes. Our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform matches the expectations of today’s digital consumer with a new kind of healthcare experience.
     Expand our suite of clinical services to address unmet needs 
     We believe that our Virtual Healthcare Delivery platform addresses significant unmet needs and we intend to continue to expand our solutions across use cases and additional care settings.
     In its annual survey, the National Business Group on Health asked 170 large employers representing 19 million lives for their perspectives on the rapidly-changing healthcare environment and the impact on healthcare costs, plan design trends, and employer initiatives. The survey indicates that employers expect healthcare costs to increase – an average of 5% in 2019 – continuing to outpace worker earnings and the Consumer Price Index. Top drivers include high-cost claimants, specialty pharmacy, and specific conditions such as musculoskeletal and cancer. Behavioral health costs, and notably, inappropriate and inefficient use of the healthcare system are other key factors.
     The same study identified that the majority of employers’ report that their top new initiative for the year ahead is expanded implementation of virtual care. Teladoc Health’s portfolio of higher acuity offerings such as Expert Medical Opinions, Treatment Decision Support, Critical Care support, Specialty Pharmacy cost containment, Find a Doctor referrals, and Oncology Insights with IBM Watson are well positioned to meet these needs.  
    
As it relates to mental health – a costly medical issue affecting one in five American adults – the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that approximately 96.5 million Americans live in areas where there are shortages of mental health providers. To improve access to high-quality behavioral healthcare and navigation, Teladoc Health offers three care offerings to support the many different ways mental health challenges present themselves: for our B2B Clients, Behavioral Health Care provides access to ongoing treatment from licensed mental health professionals, Behavioral Health Navigator, available in multiple countries, enables high-touch review of diagnosis and treatment plans. We also offer D2C access to behavioral health professionals who treat conditions such as anxiety and depression through our Better Help service.
    
With the addition of both Advance Medical this year and the Best Doctors global network in 2017, we are able to offer solutions to our Members globally for a range of critical, life-threatening cases such as cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, inflammatory disorders, heart conditions, chronic pain, and many other chronic, complex, and critical medical issues. By bringing these provider networks together under our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform, we believe 

 
  7

 
we have created an unrivaled offering that will enable the continued expansion of our product portfolio and solve the biggest challenges of our Clients and Members.  
     We also continually explore ancillary opportunities to broaden our business. We believe our services have wide applicability across new use cases, including home care, post discharge, wellness/screening and new areas in chronic care. We will continue to respond quickly to evolving market needs with innovative solutions, including mobile applications, nutrition and wellness, biometric devices and at-home testing. 
     Increase Engagement with Our Members by Driving Expanded Access & Enhanced Touch Points
     We believe there is significant opportunity within our existing Membership base to increase engagement by continually driving awareness of and usage of our solutions. We believe our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform can become the primary entry point for on-demand, virtual healthcare for eligible individuals around the world. We will continually refine and enhance our user experience, which is a critical driver of new and repeat engagement and we will continue validating our Member satisfaction with surveys and other proactive tools. 
     Our mobile app is foundational for Teladoc Health as we have redefined virtual healthcare delivery and are providing our Members with a better way to navigate their individual care. In 2017, we launched an integrated mobile experience for our joint Teladoc Health and Best Doctors consumer brand Clients. Our Members now benefit from a single, patient-centered point of access to our Virtual Healthcare Delivery Platform. As we expand the range of products and services available to our Members, we are investing in a seamless, relevant, and personalized mobile experience that provides smart guidance for our Members. We launched at the end of 2018 our new Health Assistant, which enables Members to express their healthcare need through a user-friendly, AI-supported and guided interface. Members are then presented with the optimal product or pathway to meet their need. 
     Our industry leading user interface capabilities and expertise enable unique types of partnerships where our capabilities are delivered to our partners with their brands, logos, and workflows on mobile and web platforms.  These integrated member experience solutions drive higher member engagement, convenience and utilization. 
     We are also building robust data repositories to strengthen our predictive models and multi-channel marketing strategies to provide a more complete picture of our Members, enhancing our ability to lead targeted and purposeful campaigns. 
     We will continue to invest heavily in marketing technologies that allow us to increase Member touch-points. In addition, we will continue to actively engage Clients in benefit design, worksite marketing and executive sponsorship strategies to drive awareness about our solution.
     Expand Penetration Amongst Existing Clients
     We believe that we offer a highly differentiated suite of solutions for a broad range of market channels, spanning the spectrum of traditional healthcare system participants such as employers, health plans and health systems as well as global financial services businesses and other organizations that have extended their investment in our industry. We plan to execute this strategy by further penetrating existing relationships. Within existing accounts, we believe our current Membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. Our existing health plan Clients and self‑insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solution for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in the aggregate, and we estimate this provides us the opportunity to grow our Membership base by more than 50 million individuals by expanding our penetration within our existing Clients alone. 
     Within the health plan market, a key area for growth is in increasing penetration within Government sponsored segments, such as Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Exchange populations. Virtual healthcare is well positioned to address the cost and access challenges in many of these markets, and we expect Medicare Advantage plans to accelerate the adoption of virtual healthcare with the expansion of telehealth coverage in the 2020 plan year under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. 
    
 
  8

 

 A key focus for us in 2019 is to offer our full suite of services to all of our new and existing Clients across all channels. As a result, we are continuing to invest in new marketing technologies and support staff to aid our sales force to expand existing Client relationships, support new service implementations and generate lead for potential new Clients.
     Leverage Existing Distribution Channels and Expand Penetration of Global Markets
     We have developed a highly effective and efficient global distribution network. Our international operations are headquartered in Barcelona with satellite locations in countries covering Europe, South America and Asia. With these locations, we are able to provide 24x7 international services to our Members worldwide, ensuring that they are conveniently helped by our physicians from whatever country where they are located. When medically necessary, our doctors can help Members navigate the local health systems to obtain the best healthcare for their situation. 
     In our core, traditional markets we are targeting large employers and health plans while simultaneously committing incremental sales and marketing resources to the small to medium business (“SMB”) sales channel to increase our penetration within this market. Additionally, we intend to further penetrate the hospital and health systems market, as we believe our solution offers these markets an attractive platform from which to generate substantial income by acquiring new patients and to better participate in emerging risk-sharing and value-based payment models, such as Accountable Care Organizations and Patient-Centered Medical Homes. 
     Most recently, we expanded our international presence through the acquisition of Advance Medical in 2018, building on our acquisition of Best Doctors in 2017. This international Client base, largely comprised of global financial services companies, provides fertile ground for expansion of our product portfolio through existing partners in attractive markets where our infrastructure is already in place. We have embarked on exploring the global expansion of telehealth through our expanded distribution network. 
     The company’s global expansion is supported by our technology’s localization components that service a global provider network, route visits based on mobile device location information, support real time context switching among multiple languages, interface with electronic prescribing networks around the world, and leverage local reference data standards.
     Expand Through Focused Acquisitions
     We plan to continue to support our overall strategy and market leadership with selective acquisitions. To date, we have completed multiple acquisitions that have expanded our distribution capabilities, broadened our service offering, and created a global footprint. Our acquisition strategy is centered on acquiring products, capabilities, clinical specialties, technologies and distribution channels that are highly scalable and rapidly growing. We have also established a track record of integrating these acquisitions to deliver incremental value to our Clients and Members; the new Global Care service which we began offering US multinationals in 2018 was commercialized as a result of the Advance Medical acquisition. We will continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and virtual healthcare strategy.     Technology and Operations
     Our integrated technology platform supports rapid and efficient access to, and evaluation of, information from a variety of healthcare network participants. It has a user-friendly interface designed to empower Members and dependents to remotely access healthcare whenever and wherever an individual chooses (via mobile devices, the Internet, video and phone).
     Our enterprise scale platform is architected for sharing clinical and non-clinical data in real time among the Teladoc Health constituents, which include: Members, Providers, provider network operations centers staff, nurses, SureScripts (for electronic medication prescription writing, routing and fulfillment) and health plans for real time Member eligibility verification, financial responsibility calculations, claims processing, clinical summaries and clinical alerts.

 The Teladoc Health telehealth provider network leverages our technology platform for managing custom visit queues that automatically and instantly route requested visits to the appropriate Providers based upon proprietary algorithms. Providers use our Internet based application or iOS app for viewing their visit queue, scheduling visits and following the proprietary Teladoc Health workflow for reviewing Members’ medical history and symptoms, documenting the completed visits, e Prescribing, if appropriate, and sending applicable medical content with follow up instructions to the Member via a secure message center.
     We use data and analytics to predict demand patterns by geography and we recruit and manage our Provider network to meet the demands of our Members. Our complex algorithms enable us to effectively manage/allocate supply and onboard Providers to meet demand while maintaining one hour guaranteed response times, with a median response time of less than ten minutes.
     Additionally, our platform’s external connectivity and easy integration with EMR and outside systems extends its functionality and customer features, which include:
    
· | Member real‑time eligibility and financial liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | clinical alerts, including gaps in care integration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | partner integration and operability;
--+-------------------------------------


· | clinical data exchange (including, biometrics and visit information); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a fully functional RESTful API.
--+--------------------------------

      REST is a stateless, scalable web services architecture that utilizes open communication standards such as HTTP and HTTPS, and has been widely adopted for system to system communications. Having a documented set of RESTful API’s enables our Clients and Members to access our solution using a custom or existing website or mobile app. For example, a Teladoc Health plan Client can offer its Members the ability to access our solution through their existing Member portal. Members can also register for Teladoc Health, complete their medical history, select a pharmacy and request a visit without having to access the Teladoc Health Member site. All of these functions are provided via the Client’s website or mobile app that completes system calls to the Teladoc Health API to process the requests.
     The primary goal of our integrated platform architecture is to provide a single member experience for our Clients whether they have purchased one or several of our service offerings. This is accomplished via an enterprise services-based architecture that isolates functional capabilities into independent, standalone service pods that can be accessed by our member facing web and mobile properties. These services can also be accessed by partners that desire tighter integrations with seamless experiences for their Members through Single Sign on (SSO), our SDK and our APIs. These pods can be independently managed and scaled to meet varying usage requirements. 
     We host portions of our application platforms and rely on cloud partners for our infrastructure to serve our users. For the non-cloud-based infrastructure, we utilize two redundant data centers in geographically diverse locations. We rely on third party vendors to operate these data centers, which are designed to host computer systems that require high levels of availability and have redundant subsystems and compartmentalized security zones. We utilize commercially available hardware for our data center servers. Due to the sensitive nature of our Members and Clients’ data, we have a heightened focus on data security and protection. We have a rigorous and comprehensive information security program managed by a dedicated department of security engineers and analysts. We have implemented telehealth industry standard processes, policies and tools through all levels of our software development and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scanning and third-party penetration testing in order to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our system. 
     Systems are actively monitored for any signs of unusual behavior and preemptive action is taken when necessary. Encrypted backup files are transmitted over secure connections to a redundant server storage device in a 

 
  10

 
secondary data center. Our data center facilities employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity, including redundant power and cooling systems, advanced fire and flood prevention, and 24x7 security guards.
     We have also successfully grown our business to a level that supports the establishment of Teladoc Health owned provider network operations centers located in Lewisville, TX, Quincy, MA, Phoenix, AZ and Barcelona, Spain. Through these internal operations centers, our employees service Teladoc Health Members and Clients with expanded customer service, compliance monitoring, provider network operations as well as other business support functions.
     The internal operations centers operate on a hosted virtual call center platform providing intelligent call routing across the centers for inbound and outbound member and client services in a geo-redundant enterprise 24 X 7 X 365. Through the platform, the centers operate as one in a virtual environment providing better time zone coverage, resource optimization, and disaster recovery roll-over.
     Sales and Marketing
     We sell our services principally through our direct sales organization. Our direct sales team is comprised of enterprise‑focused field sales professionals who are organized by geography and account size. Our field professionals are supported by a sales operations staff, including product technology experts, lead generation professionals and sales data experts. We maintain relationships with key industry participants including benefit consultants, brokers, group purchasing organizations and health plan and hospital partners.
     We generate Client leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target human resource, benefits and finance executives in addition to technology and health professionals, senior business leaders and healthcare channel partners. Our principal marketing programs include use of our website to provide information about our company and our solution, as well as learning opportunities for potential Members; demand generation; field marketing events; integrated marketing campaigns comprised of direct email and online advertising; and participation in industry events, trade shows and conferences.
     Clients and Members
     Our Clients consist of (i) employers, including 360 Fortune 1000 companies, (ii) health plans and (iii) health systems and other entities. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 12,000 Clients and our services reached over 22.8 million Members. The following is a selection of our Clients:
· | employers, such as Accenture, Bank of America, General Mills, and T‑Mobile;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health plans, such as Aetna, Premera, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, Highmark Inc. and CareFirst of Maryland, Inc.; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | health systems, such as Einstein Healthcare Network, Silver Cross Hospital, Jefferson Partners Healthcare and Highmark Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Within existing accounts, we believe our current Membership represents only a fraction of the potential Members available to us. For example, our existing health plan Clients and self‑insured Clients associated with these health plans currently purchase our solution for only a small percentage of their beneficiaries in aggregate, reflecting a significant opportunity for Membership growth. We believe there are in excess of 50 million potential Members within these existing Clients alone.
    
Research and Development
     Our ability to compete depends, in large part, on our continuous commitment to rapidly introduce new services, technologies, features and functionality. Our product development team is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our solution. In addition, we utilize certain third‑party development services to perform

application development and design services. We focus our efforts on developing new products and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our solution.
     Competition
     We view as our competitors those companies that currently (or in the future will) (i) develop and market telehealth technology (devices and systems) or (ii) provide telehealth, such as the delivery of on‑demand access to healthcare. In the provision of telehealth, competition focuses on, among other factors, experience in operation, customer service, quality of technology and know‑how and reputation. Competitors in the telehealth and expert medical services market include MDLive, Inc., American Well Corporation and Grand Rounds, Inc., among other small industry participants.     Teladoc Health Physicians, P.A.
     We contract for the services of our telehealth provider network through a Services Agreement with Teladoc Physicians, P.A.. Under the Services Agreement, we have agreed to serve, on an exclusive basis, as manager and administrator of Teladoc Physicians, P.A.’s non‑medical functions and services related to the provision of the telehealth services by providers employed by or under contract with Teladoc Physicians, PA.. The non‑medical functions and services we provide under the Services Agreement primarily include member management services, such as maintaining network operations centers for our Members to request a visit with Teladoc Physicians P.A.’s providers, member billing and collection administration, and maintenance and storage of member medical records. Teladoc Physicians, P.A. has agreed to provide our Members, through its providers, access to telehealth services and recommended treatment 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The Services Agreement also requires Teladoc Physicians, P.A. to maintain the state licensure and other credentialing requirements of its providers. Under the Services Agreement, Teladoc Physicians P.A. currently pays us an access fee of $65,000 per month for network operations center and medical records maintenance, a fixed fee of approximately $299,000 and $259,000, respectively per month for our provision of management and administrative services and marketing expense, interest expense of $31,000 per month and a license fee of $10,000 per month for the non‑exclusive use of the Teladoc Health trade name. The Services Agreement has a 20‑year term and expires in February 2025 unless earlier terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by a party following the commencement of bankruptcy or liquidation proceeds by the non‑terminating party, a material breach of the Services Agreement by the non‑terminating party or a governmental or judicial termination order related to the Services Agreement. The Teladoc Physicians, P.A. is considered a variable interest entity and its financial results are included in Teladoc Health’s consolidated financial statements.     Regulation

OTHER INFORMATION
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had over 2,000 employees focused on our mission of transforming the way healthcare is delivered around the world. Our dedicated employees are guided by our corporate values and driven by a passion to help people. The breadth, depth and diversity of our employee base are key differentiators for us.     Intellectual Property
     We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States and around the world. We also 

 
  12

 
have trademark applications pending to register marks in the United States and internationally. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know‑how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. Other than the trademarks Teladoc Health (and design), Best Doctors (and design) and Advance Medical (and design), we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.
     Legal Proceedings
     From time to time, Teladoc Health is involved in various litigation matters arising out of the normal course of business, including the matters described below. We consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to such matters. Estimating the probable losses or a range of probable losses resulting from litigation, government actions and other legal proceedings is inherently difficult and requires an extensive degree of judgment, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages, may involve discretionary amounts, present novel legal theories, are in the early stages of the proceedings, or are subject to appeal. Whether any losses, damages or remedies ultimately resulting from such matters could reasonably have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including, for example, the timing and amount of such losses or damages (if any) and the structure and type of any such remedies. Teladoc Health’s management does not presently expect any litigation matter to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
     On December 12, 2018, a purported securities class action complaint (Reiner v. Teladoc Health, Inc., et.al.) was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our officers. The complaint is brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of our common stock during the period March 3, 2016 through December 5, 2018. The complaint asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly false or misleading statements and omissions with respect to, among other things, the alleged misconduct of one of our previous Executive Officers. The complaint seeks certification as a class action and unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and attorneys’ fees. A lead plaintiff has not yet been appointed. We believe that the claims against us and our officers are without merit, and we and our named officers intend to defend ourselves vigorously. In light of, among other things, the early stage of the litigation, we are unable to predict the outcome of this action and are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from an unfavorable outcome.
     On May 14, 2018, a purported class action complaint (Thomas v. Best Doctors, Inc.) was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against our wholly owned subsidiary, Best Doctors, Inc. The complaint alleges that on or about May 16, 2017, Best Doctors violated the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited facsimiles to plaintiff and certain other recipients without the recipients’ prior express invitation or permission. The lawsuit seeks statutory damages for each violation, subject to trebling under the TCPA, and injunctive relief. We will vigorously defend the lawsuit and any potential loss is currently deemed to be immaterial. 
     Seasonality
     We typically experience the strongest increases in consecutive quarterly revenue during the fourth and first quarters of each year, which coincides with traditional annual benefit enrollment seasons. In particular, as a result of many Clients’ introduction of new services at the very end of the current year, or the start of each year, the majority of our new Client contracts have an effective date of January 1. Therefore, while Membership increases, utilization is dampened until service delivery ramps up over the course of the year. Additionally, as a result of national seasonal cold and flu trends, we typically experience our highest level of visit fees during the first and fourth quarters of each year when compared to other quarters of the year. Conversely, the second quarter of the year has historically been the period of lowest utilization of our provider network services relative to the other quarters of the year.
