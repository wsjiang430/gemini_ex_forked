Item 1. Business. 
 Elastic is a search company. 
 Search is foundational to a wide variety of experiences. Elastic makes the power of search—the ability to instantly find relevant information and insights from large amounts of data—available for a diverse set of applications and use cases. 
 When you hail a ride home from work with Uber, Elastic helps power the systems that locate nearby riders and drivers. When you shop online at Walgreens, Elastic helps power finding the right products to add to your cart. When you look for a partner on Tinder, Elastic helps power the algorithms that guide you to a match. When you search across Adobe’s millions of assets, Elastic helps power finding the right photo, font, or color palette to complete your project. As Sprint operates its nationwide network of mobile subscribers, Elastic helps power the logging of billions of events per day to track and manage website performance issues and network outages. As SoftBank monitors the usage of thousands of servers across its entire IT environment, Elastic helps power the processing of terabytes of daily data in real time. When Indiana University welcomes a new student class, Elastic helps power the cybersecurity operations protecting thousands of devices and critical data across collaborating universities in the BigTen Security Operations Center. All of this is search. 
 Why we search remains constant: we’re looking for insight, information, and answers. But how and what we search changes over time, from the Dewey Decimal System for libraries to Google for the World Wide Web to conversations with virtual assistants for everyday inquiries. Today, what we search has grown to include a rapidly increasing amount of structured and unstructured data from a multitude of sources such as databases, websites, applications, and mobile and connected devices. While search experiences often begin with search boxes, they are not confined to them. Dragging your finger across a map on a smartphone screen is search. Zooming into a specific time frame in a histogram is search. Mining log files for errors is search. Forecasting storage capacity two weeks into the future is search. Using natural language processing to analyze user sentiment is search. 
 Elastic created the Elastic Stack, a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. Developers build on top of the Elastic Stack to apply the power of search to their data and solve business problems. We have also built software solutions on the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases including app search, site search, enterprise search, logging, metrics, application performance monitoring (“APM”), business analytics, and security analytics. The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run on premises, in public or private clouds, or in hybrid environments. As the technology landscape shifts, our products grow and adapt. In that sense, we believe that our company is truly elastic. 
 Our origins are rooted in open source, which facilitates rapid adoption of our software and enables efficient distribution of our technology. Developers can download our software directly from our website for use in development and production environments. These downloads include both free and paid products. Open source also fosters our vibrant community of developers who help improve our products and build on top of them. As of April 30, 2019, our community included over 120,000 Meetup members across 215 Meetup groups in 48 countries. Meetup members are individuals who opt into an Elasticsearch Meetup group on meetup.com, an independent third-party website. 
 Our business model is based on a combination of open source and proprietary software. Many features of our software can be used free of charge. Some are only available through paid subscriptions, which include access to specific proprietary features and also include support. Unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise version of an original open source project. Instead, we develop and test one robust codebase, over which we maintain control. We believe that maintaining full control over the source code enables us to develop better products for our users and customers. Our sales and marketing efforts start with developers who have already adopted our software and then evolve to departmental decision-makers and senior executives who have broad purchasing power in their organizations. All of these actions help us build a powerful commercial business model on top of open source. 
 Our customers often significantly expand their usage of our products over time. Expansion includes increasing the number of developers using our products, increasing the utilization of our products for a particular use case, and applying our products to new use cases. We focus some of our direct sales efforts on encouraging these types of expansion within our customer base.

Our business has experienced rapid growth around the world. As of April 30, 2019, we had over 8,100 customers compared to over 5,000 and over 2,800 customers as of April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our revenue was $271.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2019, or fiscal 2019, $159.9 million in the year ended April 30, 2018, or fiscal 2018, and $88.2 million in the year ended April 30, 2017, or fiscal 2017, representing year-over-year growth of 70% and 81% for the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Subscriptions accounted for 91%, 93% and 90% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Revenue from outside the United States accounted for 43%, 39% and 31% of our total revenue in the years ended April 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In the years ended April 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred net losses of $102.3 million, $52.7 million and $52.0 million, respectively, and our net cash used in operating activities was $23.9 million, $20.8 million and $16.1 million, respectively. We expect we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. 
 Our Products 
 We founded Elastic to bring the power of search to a broad range of business and consumer use cases. Our products enable our users and customers to instantly find relevant information and insights in large amounts of data. 
 We offer the Elastic Stack (previously known as the ELK Stack), a powerful set of software products that ingest and store data from any source, and in any format, and perform search, analysis, and visualization in milliseconds or less. The Elastic Stack is designed for direct use by developers to power a variety of use cases. We also offer software solutions built on the Elastic Stack that address a wide variety of use cases. The Elastic Stack and our solutions are designed to run on premises, in public or private clouds, or in hybrid environments. 
 The Elastic Stack 
 The Elastic Stack is comprised of four primary products: 
  
• | Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. It is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine and datastore for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Kibana. Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It is the visualization layer for data stored in Elasticsearch. It is also the management and configuration interface for all parts of the Elastic Stack. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beats. Beats is the family of lightweight, single-purpose data shippers for sending data from edge machines to Elasticsearch or Logstash. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Logstash. Logstash is the dynamic data processing pipeline for ingesting data into Elasticsearch or other storage systems from a multitude of sources simultaneously. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some features of the Elastic Stack are open source, while others are proprietary. Some proprietary features are licensed to users at no cost, while others require paid subscriptions. Paid proprietary features enable capabilities such as automating anomaly detection on time series data at scale, facilitating compliance with data security and privacy regulations, and allowing real-time notifications and alerts. The source code of all free and paid features in the Elastic Stack is visible to the public in the form of “open code.” 
 Our Solutions 
 We have built a number of solutions on top of the Elastic Stack to make it easier for organizations to use our software for certain common use cases. Like the Elastic Stack, our solutions comprise a combination of open source features, free proprietary features, and paid proprietary features. The solutions we offer include: 

• | App Search to power search in applications across documents, geographies, numbers, and more. It powers many familiar application user experience features: search bars, facets, time range, pricing sliders, result highlighting, pagination, geographic filters, and product recommendations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Site Search to create website search experiences. With seamless web crawling, high relevance, and intuitive customization features, our site search solution delivers an experience complete with features for spell correction, bigram matching, stemming, synonym recognition, phrase matching, suggested results, and more.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Enterprise Search to quickly and easily search, discover, and organize information spread across businesses, including medical files, corporate communications, legal documents, stock trades, invoices, and presentations. It uses natural language processing to predict and learn from search queries to make results more accurate over time, and scales automatically to ensure continued performance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Logging to search and analyze petabytes of server and application logs to better ensure website, infrastructure, and application availability and performance. It allows users to ingest and index the data they may find important in order to quickly troubleshoot performance issues, help improve customer satisfaction, drive operational efficiencies, and more.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Metrics to search and analyze numeric and time series data ranging from CPU usage to car sensor data or human heartbeats. It allows users to freely, continuously, and efficiently explore attributes such as host name, IP address, deployment, or color across any dimension at scale, and in a matter of minutes, view CPU, utilization, and process-level statistics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Uptime to easily track and monitor the availability, performance, and functionality of the hosts, websites, services and applications that make a business run. It enables administrators to proactively detect issues before users report them, and quickly investigate the root cause.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | APM to deliver insight into application metrics and provide developers with confidence in the code they have deployed. It enables developers to instrument their application code to capture performance data for visualization and exploration in pre-configured dashboards and custom user interfaces for common APM workflows.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Business Analytics to analyze and measure business performance and goals. It delivers real-time insights into performance data such as customer satisfaction, online content performance, marketing metrics, and sales efficiency through informative and shareable visualizations and dashboards.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security Analytics to harden enterprise security by detecting zero-day malicious activity via real-time threat hunting and enabling creation of tailored security workflows. It is fast and nimble for ad hoc data exploration and scales to ingest all types of security data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maps to allow real-time visualization and analysis of geospatial data. Whether you're monitoring the source location of a DDoS attack in real time, mapping top cities driving your web traffic or tracking deliveries in real time, location is an integral component of many search experiences.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Deployment Options 
 The Elastic Stack and our solutions generally can be deployed on premises, in public or private clouds, or in hybrid environments, to satisfy various user and customer needs. Our goal is to ultimately offer all of our products as both self-managed and SaaS deployments. 

• | Self-Managed. Today, most users manage their own deployments of the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To help with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE), a paid proprietary product, to deliver centralized provisioning, management, and monitoring across multiple deployments. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SaaS. Many customers are becoming increasingly interested in SaaS deployment alternatives that reduce the burden of administration. For these customers we have developed a family of SaaS products called Elastic Cloud, which includes Elasticsearch Service, Site Search Service and App Search Service. We host and manage our Elastic Cloud products on infrastructure from multiple public cloud providers.

Our Business Model 
 Our business model refers to how we make our software available, including our open source distribution and go-to-market strategy, and how we charge our customers. We believe our business model creates significant value for our users, our customers, and our company. 
 Our business model is based on a combination of open source and proprietary software. We market and distribute the Elastic Stack and our solutions using an open source distribution strategy. Developers are able to download our software directly from our website. Many features of our software can be used free of charge. Some are only available through paid subscriptions, which include access to specific proprietary features and also include support. These paid features can be unlocked with a simple license update, without the need to re-deploy the software. The rate at which our customers purchase additional subscriptions and expand the value of existing subscriptions depends on a number of factors, including customers’ level of satisfaction with our products, the nature and size of the deployments, the desire to address additional use cases, and the perceived need for additional proprietary features. The source code of all Elastic Stack features, whether they are open source or proprietary, is visible to the public in the form of “open code.” 
 Our open source model facilitates rapid and efficient developer adoption, particularly by empowering individual developers to download and use our software without payment, registration, or the friction of a formal sales interaction. Our use of open source licensing fosters a vibrant developer community around our products and solutions, which drives adoption of our products and increased interaction among users. Further, this approach enables community review of our code and products, which allows us to improve the reliability and security of our software. We believe that the number of times our products have been downloaded and the size of our developer community are indicative of the benefits of our open source strategy and the growth in adoption of our products. However, we typically do not have visibility into whether our products are being actively used unless the user opts to interact with us. As a result, we cannot accurately determine how much of our downloaded software is being actively used. 
 We have designed our strategy to avoid some of the risks associated with an open source model. One such risk relates to control over the direction and roadmap of our products. We maintain full control over the source code of our products and solutions. While community members may suggest changes to our products, only Elastic employees are able to commit changes to the codebase. Further, unlike some open source companies, we do not build a separate enterprise edition of an original open source project. Instead, we develop, maintain, and test a single robust codebase that is shared by our entire developer community. 
 Some open source companies sell only support for software that they make available at no cost. We believe this can create misaligned incentives in that the support vendor benefits from low software quality. Accordingly, we focus on designing high-quality software products that include proprietary features and are easy to use and reliable. We include support only as part of our subscriptions. 
 We believe in building products that provide value and appeal to the people who use them, including developers, architects, DevOps personnel, IT professionals, and security analysts. At the same time, a software company should be able to engage and build relationships with departmental or organizational leaders who make large technology purchasing decisions. At Elastic, we do both. 
 Strengths of Our Products 
 The strengths of our products include the following: 
  
• | Speed. The Elastic Stack can find matches for search criteria in milliseconds within even the largest structured and unstructured datasets. Its schema-less structure and inverted indices enable real-time search of high volumes of structured, unstructured, and time series data. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scale. The Elastic Stack is a distributed system and can scale massively. It has the ability to subdivide search indices into multiple pieces called shards, which enables data volume to be scaled horizontally and operations to be distributed across hundreds of systems or more. A developer running hundreds of nodes has the same user experience as a developer running a single node on a laptop. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Relevance. Elasticsearch uses multiple analytical techniques to determine the similarity between stored data and queries, generating highly relevant results reflecting a deep understanding of text and context. Its sophisticated yet developer-friendly query language permits advanced search and analytics. Additionally, the speed of the Elastic Stack permits query iteration, further enhancing the relevance of search results. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of Use. The Elastic Stack is engineered to take a user from data to dashboard or inquiry to insight in minutes. It offers an easy getting started experience, featuring streamlined download and deployment, sensible defaults, a simple and intuitive query language that just works, and no need to define a schema up front. Administrative tasks such as securing the Elastic Stack are intuitive and integrated into the user experience, as are investigative tasks such as data visualization. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexibility. The Elastic Stack is able to ingest, filter, store, search, and analyze data in any form, whether structured or unstructured. These capabilities enable the Elastic Stack to generate insights from a wide variety of data sources for a range of use cases. The flexibility of the Elastic Stack also enables users to begin using our products along with their existing systems, which lowers barriers to adoption. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensibility. Developers can use the Elastic Stack as a foundation for addressing a wide variety of use cases. Our open source approach to building the Elastic Stack empowers developers to innovate and utilize it to fit their specific needs. Additionally, our developer community actively engages with us to improve and expand the Elastic Stack. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategies 
 We intend to pursue the following growth strategies: 
  
• | Increase product adoption by improving ease of use and growing our open source community. With our engineering efforts focused on the user experience, we will continue to develop software that makes our products easier to use and adopt for both developers and non-developers. We will continue to engage with developers globally through a wide range of touch points such as community meetups, global community groups, hackathons, our global events, which we call Elastic{ON}, and engagement on our website, user forums, and code repositories, to grow our open source community. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our customer base by acquiring new customers. Through our open source distribution strategy, users can easily download our software directly from our website and access many features of our software free of charge, which facilitates rapid adoption. Our sales and marketing team conducts campaigns to drive further awareness and adoption within the user community. As a result, many of our sales prospects are already familiar with our technology prior to entering into a commercial relationship with us. Additionally, we leverage our network of partners to drive awareness and expand our sales and marketing reach to target new customers. We will continue to engage our community and our partners to drive awareness and to invest in our sales and marketing team to grow our customer base. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand within our existing customer base through new use cases and larger deployments. We often enter an organization through a single developer or a small team for an initial project or use case with an objective to quickly solve a technical challenge or business problem. Because of the rapid success with our products, knowledge of Elastic often spreads within an organization to new teams of developers, architects, IT operations personnel, security personnel, and senior executives. We will continue to invest in helping users and customers be successful with our products, and we view initial success with our products as a path to drive expansion to new use cases and projects and larger deployments within organizations.

Customer Support 
 We endeavor to make it easy for developers to download, install, deploy and use the Elastic Stack and our solutions. To this end, our open source developer community functions as a source of support and enables developers to engage in self-help and collaboration. 
 However, in many situations, such as those involving complex enterprise IT environments, large deployments and novel use cases, our users require our support. Accordingly, we include support as part of the subscriptions we sell for our products. Our global support organization is comprised of highly technical support engineers who are contributors to our open source, and provide support experiences including troubleshooting, technical audits, cluster tuning, and upgrade assistance. Our support team is distributed across over 20 countries and provides coverage 24 hours per day, all 365 days per year, across multiple languages. 
 We believe that software companies should not have incentives to build low quality software. In that connection, we do not sell support separately from our software subscriptions. 
 Our Technology 
 Our products consist of the Elastic Stack, our solutions, and software that supports our various deployment alternatives. 
 Technology Features of the Elastic Stack 
 Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack, where users store, search, and analyze data. Key features of Elasticsearch include the following: 
  
• | Store any type of data. Elasticsearch combines powerful parts of traditional search engines, such as an inverted index to power fast full text search and a column store for analytics, with native support for a wide range of data types, including text, dates, numbers, geospatial data, date/numeric ranges, and IP addresses. With sensible defaults, and no upfront schema definition necessary, Elasticsearch makes it easy to start simple and fine-tune as datasets grow. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Powerful query language. The Elasticsearch query domain specific language is a flexible, expressive search language that exposes a rich set of query capabilities across any kind of data. From simple Boolean operators to custom relevance functions, users can articulate exactly what they are looking for and bring their own definition of relevance. The query language also includes a composable aggregation framework that enables users to summarize, slice, and analyze structured or semi-structured datasets across multiple dimensions. Examples of these capabilities include tracking the top ten users by spend, looking at data week over week, analyzing data across geographies, and drilling down into details with specific filters all with a single search. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developer friendliness. Elasticsearch has consistent, well-documented application programming interfaces (APIs) that work the same way on one node during initial development as on a hundred nodes in production. Elasticsearch also ships with a number of language clients that provide a natural way to integrate with a variety of popular programming frameworks, reducing the learning curve, and leading to a shorter time to realizing value. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High speed. Everything stored in Elasticsearch is indexed by default, such that users do not need to decide in advance what queries they will want to run. Our architecture optimizes throughput, time-to-data availability and query latency. Elasticsearch can easily index millions of events per second, and newly added data can be available for search nearly instantly. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High scale and availability. Elasticsearch is designed to scale horizontally and be resilient to node or hardware failures. As nodes join a cluster, data is automatically re-balanced and queries and indexing are spread across the new nodes seamlessly. This makes it easy to add hardware to increase indexing throughput or improve query throughput. Elasticsearch also detects node failures and hardware or network issues and automatically protects user data by ejecting the failing or inaccessible nodes and creating new replicas of the data. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Machine learning and alerting. Machine learning capabilities such as anomaly detection, forecasting, and categorization are tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack to automatically model the behavior of data, such as trends and periodicity, in real time in order to identify issues faster, streamline root cause analysis, and reduce false positives. Without these capabilities, it can be very difficult to identify issues such as infrastructure problems or intruders in real time across complex, high-volume, fast-moving datasets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. Security features give administrators the rights to grant specific levels of access to their various types of users, such as IT, operations, and application teams. Elasticsearch serves as the central authentication hub for the entire Elastic Stack. Security features include encrypted communications and encryption-at-rest; role-based access control; single sign-on and authentication; field-level, attribute-level, and document-level security; and audit logging.

 Kibana is the user interface for the Elastic Stack. It allows users to manage the Elastic Stack and visualize data. Additionally, the interfaces for many of our solutions are built into Kibana. Key features of Kibana include the following: 
  
• | Explore and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch. Kibana provides interactive data views, visualizations, and dashboards powered by structured filtering and unstructured search to enable users to get to answers more quickly. A variety of data visualization types, such as simple line and bar charts, purpose-built geospatial and time series visualizations, tree diagrams, network diagrams, heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms, support diverse user needs. Kibana Canvas is a composable and extensible creative infographics and reporting tool. Canvas creates multi-slide presentations backed by live data and infographics, in addition to fully customized live applications, all powered by data stored in Elasticsearch. Reporting features on top of Canvas enable sharing of these visualizations across the enterprise.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elastic Cloud and Elastic Cloud Enterprise 
 The Elastic Stack and our solutions can be deployed on premises, in public and private clouds, and in hybrid environments. We divide our deployment models into two categories: self-managed, which refers to users deploying the Elastic Stack and solutions on infrastructure they manage themselves (such as their own data center or private or public cloud environments), and Elastic Cloud, which refers to our SaaS products that we host and manage. To help self-managed users with more complex deployment scenarios, we offer Elastic Cloud Enterprise. 

• | Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud is our growing family of SaaS products and technologies that make it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elastic products and solutions in the cloud. Elastic Cloud products include Elasticsearch Service, Site Search Service, and App Search Service, and are offered by us on certain large cloud providers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Elastic Cloud Enterprise. As part of building our Elastic Cloud offering, we built a comprehensive orchestration and administration infrastructure tool to easily provision, monitor, manage, secure, upgrade and backup the thousands of clusters that comprise our Elastic Cloud products. We then packaged this infrastructure into a downloadable and easily installable proprietary product called Elastic Cloud Enterprise, which makes this tool available to customers to use with their own self-managed deployments. Elastic Cloud Enterprise enables our customers to provision, monitor, manage, secure, upgrade and backup any number of clusters. It also helps our customers improve their hardware utilization and operational efficiency by allowing them to leverage shared hardware resources to manage multiple clusters, while still maintaining a strong level of isolation between those clusters.

Our Source Code 
 We define our culture by our “source code,” which expresses our core corporate values. 
  
• | Home, Dinner: There is no such thing as work-life balance. We are successful if we find balance in life. Elastic empowers its employees with the flexibility to do so. Be home for dinner, go for a run midday, care for a sick child, or visit a parent. Finding balance means being more innovative and efficient at work. Which makes for a better Elastic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Space, Time: It’s easy to get stuck in a day-to-day work pattern. Allowing for the space and time to dream requires conscious effort. Embracing a high failure rate does, too. Fulfillment comes from doing the obvious and dreaming up the un-obvious. Both are foundations of Elastic.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IT, Depends: It’s pretty complicated to make some things simple, and even more complicated to make other things possible. We embrace and value the knowledge required to do both. When a question is asked, buckle up. Sh*t is about to get real. Your journey will likely start with “it depends.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progress, SIMPLE Perfection: Perfection is not a destination. Color inside the lines or color outside the lines. Just pick a color. It’s as simple as 2048. An Elastic that moves is an Elastic that survives, thrives, and stands the test of time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 01.02, /FORMAT: Our products are distributed by design, our company is distributed by intention. With many languages, perspectives, and cultures, it’s easy to lose something in translation. Over email and chat, doubly so. Until we get a perpetual empathy machine, don’t assume malice. A distributed Elastic makes for a diverse Elastic, which makes for a better Elastic.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As YOU, Are: We all come in different shapes with different interests and skills. We all have an accent. Celebrate it. Just come as you are. No need to invest neurons trying to fit an arbitrary mold. We’d rather you put them to work shaping Elastic.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HUMBLE, Ambitious: Ambition drives us to challenge ourselves and the people around us to do better. It is not an excuse to be an *sshole. Be humble. Be ambitious. At Elastic, we are both.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Speed, SCALE, Relevance: Elastic is a search company. We focus on value to users by producing fast results that operate at scale and are relevant. This is our DNA. We believe search is an experience. It is what defines us, binds us, and makes us unique.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Distributed Culture 
 The Elastic Stack is powerful because it is distributed, gaining speed and stability from each additional node. Our company emulates the strengths of the distributed systems we build. 

• | Distributed systems, distributed teams. Elastic was born a distributed company, with founders in Israel, Germany, and the Netherlands, and early employees from the United Kingdom, France, Spain, the Czech Republic, and the United States. From our experience in open source projects, we know that great code and amazing ideas can come from anyone, anywhere. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strength in diversity. Being a distributed company is about harnessing the inherent strengths of diversity. Different people approach problems differently. We need that. When a consensus is reached between a wide variety of minds, the result is a solution that should stand the test of time. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supporting resiliency. Distributed systems are only powerful if they’re resilient. The same is true for our company. We are constantly improving the Elastic Stack to handle the challenges of distribution just as we are constantly improving how we support our employees no matter where they are. Organizational resiliency also requires recognizing that it’s not tools that make distribution work, it’s the people. Successful collaboration takes more than video calls and shared calendars. It takes a warm welcoming to let new hires know all cultures are accepted. It means always assuming the best intention of our peers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Building camaraderie. We hire intentionally. We hire thoughtfully. Smart. Curious. Nice. Respectful. These are qualities we look for in every Elastician. Our goal isn’t to build a company of people that simply work well together; our goal is to build a company that creates well together, imagines well together, laughs well together, dances well together. We want to build a culture of camaraderie so that no matter where someone’s located, they always feel connected. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Distributed us? Distributed you? Distributed we! Elastic the company is just one piece of the Elastic community. Direct contact between our internal team and Elastic users is fundamental to our success. It’s this culture of communication that enables us to maintain our commitment to open source. Distributed isn’t always easy, and it isn’t for everyone, but we believe it’s the foundation of our success. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community 
 As an open source company, our team extends beyond our employee base. It includes the millions of users who download our software, and over 120,000 Meetup members across 215 Meetup groups in 48 countries as of April 30, 2019. Our users interact with us on our website forums and on Twitter, GitHub, StackOverflow, Quora, Facebook, Weibo, WeChat, and more. 
 In order to build products that best meet our users’ needs, we focus on, and invest in, building a strong community. Each download of the Elastic Stack is a new opportunity to educate our next contributor, hear about a new use case, explore the need for a new feature, or meet a future member of the team. Community is core to our identity, binding our products closely together with our users. Community gives us an ability to get their candid feedback, creating a direct line of communication between our users and the builders of our products across all of our features—open source, unpaid proprietary, and paid proprietary—enabling us to make our products simpler and better. 
 The Elastic community has a Code of Conduct. It covers the behaviors of the Elastic community in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, code repository, IRC channel, private correspondence, or public meeting. It is designed to ensure that the Elastic community is a space where members and users can freely and openly communicate, collaborate, and contribute both ideas and code. It also covers our community ground rules: be considerate, be patient, be respectful, be nice, communicate effectively, and ask for help when unsure. 
 Competition 
 Our market is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new offerings. Our principal competitors include: 

• | For our app search, site search, and enterprise search solutions: incumbent offerings such as Solr (open source offering), search tools including Google Custom Search Engine (an advertisement-based site search tool with limited user controls), Google Site Search and Google Search Appliance (both of which Google has declared to be end-of-life and stopped selling), and enterprise search tools including Endeca (acquired by Oracle), FAST (acquired by Microsoft), and Autonomy (acquired by HP and now offered by Micro Focus).

--+-----------------------------

 We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, more diverse product and services offerings and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new companies, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets. While our products and solutions have various competitors across different use cases, such as app search, site search, enterprise search, logging, metrics, APM, business analytics and security analytics, we believe that few competitors currently have the capabilities to address our entire range of use cases. We believe our industry requires constant change and innovation, and we plan to continue to evolve search as a foundational technology to solve the problems of today and new emerging problems in the future. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to safeguard our core technology and other intellectual property assets. We seek to accomplish that objective by establishing intellectual property rights in and protecting those assets through a combination of patents, patent applications, registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual measures. In addition, we maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, and consultants to enter into disclosure and invention assignment agreements. As of April 30, 2019, we had 7 issued patents in the United States with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2034, 32 pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications, and eight pending non-U.S. patent filings. The pending patent applications, if issued, would expire between 2032 and 2039. In addition, as of April 30, 2019, we had 30 registered trademarks in the United States, 7 pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 277 registered trademarks in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and 41 pending trademark applications in various non-U.S. jurisdictions.
 Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property assets, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop competing technologies with the same or similar functionality. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and time consuming. The laws, procedures and restrictions on which we rely may provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. That is why we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new products, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our technology are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 
 From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights against us, our partners or our customers. Our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our partners and customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from continuing to offer our technology or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay for licenses or to pay substantial damages or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. 
 15


In addition, our technology incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses such as the Apache Software License Version 2.0. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our technology. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would, in our opinion, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves, our partners and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
Employees 
 As of April 30, 2019, we had 1,442 employees in over 35 countries. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. In certain countries in which we operate, such as France and Spain, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages.
