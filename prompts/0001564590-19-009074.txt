ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Staffing 360 Solutions, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Staffing 360,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 22, 2009, as Golden Fork Corporation, which changed its name to Staffing 360 Solutions, Inc., ticker symbol “STAF”, on March 16, 2012. On June 15, 2017, the Company changed its domicile to the State of Delaware. As a rapidly growing public company in the international staffing sector, our high-growth business model is based on finding and acquiring, suitable, mature, profitable, operating, domestic and international staffing companies. Our targeted consolidation model is focused specifically on the accounting and finance, information technology (“IT”), engineering, administration and light industrial disciplines.
 All amounts in this Annual Report are expressed in thousands, except share and per share amounts, or unless otherwise indicated.
 Business Model and Acquisitions 
 We are a high-growth international staffing company engaged in the acquisition of United States (“U.S.”) and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) based staffing companies. Our services principally consist of providing temporary contractors, and, to a much lesser extent, the recruitment of candidates for permanent placement. As part of our consolidation model, we pursue a broad spectrum of staffing companies supporting primarily accounting and finance, IT, engineering, administration (collectively, the “Professional Business Stream”) and commercial (“Commercial Business Stream”) disciplines. Our typical acquisition model is based on paying consideration in the form of cash, stock, earn-outs and/or promissory notes. In furthering our business model, the Company is regularly in discussions and negotiations with various suitable, mature acquisition targets. To date, we have completed ten acquisitions since November 2013.
Change of Year End 
 On February 28, 2017, the board of directors (the “Board”) approved the change of the Company’s fiscal year end from May 31 to a 52-53-week year ending on the Saturday closest to the 31st of December, effective December 31, 2016. On April 12, 2017, the company filed a transition report (“Transition Report”), Form 10-K/T, for the period from June 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, (“Transition Period”). Following that Transition Report, we will file annual reports for each twelve-month period ending the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year beginning with December 30, 2017 (“Fiscal 2017”), which was filed on March 29, 2018.

Industry Background
 The staffing industry is divided into three major segments: temporary staffing services, professional employer organizations (“PEOs”) and placement agencies. Temporary staffing services provide workers for limited periods, often to substitute for absent permanent workers or to help during periods of peak demand. These workers, who are often employees of the temporary staffing agency, will generally fill clerical, technical, or industrial positions. PEOs, sometimes referred to as employee leasing agencies, contract to provide workers to customers for specific functions, often related to human resource management. In many cases, a customer’s employees are hired by a PEO and then contracted back to the customer. Placement agencies, sometimes referred to as executive recruiters or headhunters, find workers to fill permanent positions at customer companies. These agencies may specialize in placing senior managers, mid-level managers, technical workers, or clerical and other support workers.
 The Company considers itself a temporary staffing company within the broader staffing industry. However, the Company provides permanent placements at the request of existing clients and some consulting services.
 Staffing companies identify potential candidates through online advertising and referrals, and interview, test and counsel workers before sending them to the customer for approval. Pre-employment screening can include skills assessment, drug tests and criminal background checks. The personnel staffing industry has been radically changed by the internet. Many employers list available positions with one or several internet personnel sites like www.monster.com or www.careerbuilder.com, and on their own sites. Personnel agencies operate their own sites and often still work as intermediaries by helping employers accurately describe job openings and by screening candidates who submit applications.
 Major end-use customers include businesses from a wide range of industries such as manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail. Marketing involves direct sales presentations, referrals from existing clients and advertising. Agencies compete both for customers and workers. Depending on market supply and demand at any given time, agencies may allocate more resources either to finding potential employers or potential workers. Permanent placement agencies work either on a retained or on a contingency basis. Clients may retain an agency for a specific job search or on contract for a specific period. Temporary staffing services charge customers a fixed price per hour or a standard markup on prevailing hourly rates.
 For many staffing companies, demand is lower late in the fourth calendar quarter and early in the first calendar quarter, partly because of holidays, and higher during the rest of the year. Staffing companies may have high receivables from customers. Temporary staffing agencies and PEOs must manage a high cash flow because they funnel payroll payments from employers. Cash flow imbalances also occur because agencies must pay workers even though they haven't been paid by clients.
 The revenue of staffing companies depends on the number of jobs they fill, which in turn can depend upon the economic environment. During economic slowdowns, many client companies stop hiring altogether. Internet employment sites expand a company’s ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Staffing companies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of personnel agencies obsolete. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing agency.
 To avoid large placement agency fees, big companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charge a fee based on a percentage of the first year's salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill have a financial incentive to avoid agencies.

Many staffing companies are small and may depend heavily on a few big customers for a large portion of revenue. Large customers may lead to increased revenue, but also expose agencies to higher risks. When major accounts experience financial hardships, and have less need for temporary employment services, agencies stand to lose large portions of revenue.
 The loss of a staff member who handles a large volume of business may result in a large loss of revenue for a staffing company. Individual staff members, rather than the staffing company itself, usually develop strong relationships with customers. Staff members who move to another staffing company are often able to move customers with them.
 Some of the best opportunities for temporary employment are in industries traditionally active in seasonal cycles, such as manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail. However, seasonal demand for workers creates cash flow fluctuations throughout the year. 
 Staffing companies are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. Many federal anti-discrimination rules regulate the type of information that employment firms can request from candidates or provide to customers about candidates. In addition, the relationship between the agency and the temporary employees, or employee candidates may not always be clear, resulting in legal and regulatory uncertainty. PEOs are often considered co-employers along with the client, but the PEO is responsible for employee wages, taxes and benefits. State regulation aims to ensure that PEOs provide the benefits they promise to workers.
 Trends in the Staffing Business
 Start-up costs for a staffing company are very low. Individual offices can be profitable, but consolidation is driven mainly by the opportunity for large agencies to develop national relationships with big customers. Some agencies expand by starting new offices in promising markets, but most prefer to buy existing independent offices with proven staff and an existing customer roster.
 At some companies, temporary workers have become such a large part of the workforce that staffing company employees sometimes work at the customer's site to recruit, train, and manage temporary employees. The Company has a number of onsite relationships with its customers. Staffing companies try to match the best qualified employees for the customer's needs, but often provide additional training specific to that company, such as instruction in the use of proprietary software.
 Some personnel consulting firms and human resource departments are increasingly using psychological tests to evaluate potential job candidates. Psychological or liability testing has gained popularity, in part, due to recent fraud scandals. In addition to stiffer background checks, headhunters often check the credit history of prospective employees.
 We believe the trends of outsourcing entire departments and dependence on temporary and leased workers will expand opportunities for staffing companies. Taking advantage of their expertise in assessing worker capabilities, some staffing companies manage their clients’ entire human resource functions. Human resources outsourcing (“HRO”) may include management of payroll, tax filings, and benefit administration services. HRO may also include recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”), whereby an agency manages all recruitment activities for a client.
 New online technology is improving staffing efficiency. For example, some online applications coordinate workflow for staffing agencies, their clients and temporary workers, and allow agencies and customers to share work order requests, submit and track candidates, approve timesheets and expenses, and run reports. Interaction between candidates and potential employers is increasingly being handled online.
 Initially viewed as rivals, some Internet job-search companies and traditional employment agencies are now collaborating. While some Internet sites do not allow agencies to use their services to post jobs or look through resumes, others find that agencies are their biggest customers, earning the sites a large percentage of their revenue. Some staffing companies contract to help client employers find workers online.
 Competition
 The Company’s staffing divisions face competition in attracting clients as well as temporary candidates. The staffing industry is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or local basis. In many areas, the local staffing companies are our strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and reliability of service. The Company believes its competitive advantage stems from its experience in niche markets, and commitment to the specialized employment market, along with its growing global presence.
 The staffing industry is characterized by a large number of competing companies in a fragmented sector. Major competitors also exist across the sector, but as the industry affords low barriers to entry, new entrants are constantly introduced to the marketplace.

The top layer of competitors includes large corporate staffing and employment companies which have yearly revenue of $75 million or more. The next (middle) layer of the competition consists of medium-sized entities with yearly revenue of $10 million or more. The largest portion of the marketplace is the bottom layer of this competitive landscape consisting of small, individual-sized or family-run operations. As barriers to entry are low, sole proprietors, partnerships and small entities routinely enter the industry.
 Employees 
 The Company employs approximately 270 full-time employees as part of our internal operations. Additionally, the Company employs more than 5,000 individuals that are placed directly with our clients through our various operating subsidiaries.
