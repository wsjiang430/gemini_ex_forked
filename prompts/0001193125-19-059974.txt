 Sales and Distribution 
 In 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. In 2017 and 2016, revenues from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. accounted for 13% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. In 2016, revenues from JA Mitsui Leasing, Ltd. accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. and JA Mitsui Leasing, Ltd. are customers of our Semiconductor Test segment. In each of the years, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our five largest customers in aggregate accounted for 27%, 32% and 36% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. 
 OSAT customers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., often purchase our test systems based upon recommendations from OEMs, IDMs and Fabless companies. In all cases when an OSAT customer purchases a test system from us, we consider the OSAT as the customer since credit risk, title and risk of loss, among other things, are between Teradyne and the OSAT. We estimate consolidated revenues driven by a single OEM customer, combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customers OSATs (which include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. and its leasing company, JA Mitsui Leasing, Ltd.), accounted for approximately 13%, 22%, and 26% of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, this OEM customer, or any of our five largest direct customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have sales and service offices located throughout North America, Asia and Europe. We sell in these areas predominantly through a direct sales force, except for Industrial Automation products which are sold through distributors. Our manufacturing activities are primarily conducted through subcontractors and outsourced contract manufacturers with significant operations in China and Malaysia. 
 Sales to customers outside the United States were 87%, 88%, and 87%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Sales are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer site.

 Raw Materials 
 Our products contain electronic and mechanical components that are provided by a wide range of suppliers. Some of these components are standard products, while others are manufactured to our specifications. We can experience occasional delays in obtaining timely delivery of certain items. While the majority of our components are available from multiple suppliers, certain items are obtained from sole sources. We may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products. 
Intellectual Property and Licenses 
 The development of our products, both hardware and software, is based in significant part on proprietary information, our brands and technology. We protect our rights in proprietary information, brands and technology through various methods, such as: 

 | patents;
--+---------


 | copyrights;
--+------------


 | trademarks;
--+------------


 | trade secrets;
--+---------------


 | standards of business conduct and related business practices; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | technology license agreements, software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, employment agreements, and other agreements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 However, these protections might not be effective in all circumstances. Competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent. Also, intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes. We do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,900 people. Since the inception of our business, we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances. 
 Environmental Affairs 
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local government laws and regulations relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. We accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated. Estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods. However, estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations.
