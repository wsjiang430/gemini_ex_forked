ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
United Health Products, Inc. ("UHP" or the "Company") develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic gauze for the healthcare and wound care sectors. The product, HemoStyp®, is derived from all natural, regenerated oxidized cellulose and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and help control bleeding. The Company sells its product to the veterinarian, dental, medical, military and sports markets, each of which represents a multi-million-dollar market opportunity for the Company. We also sell products aimed at the consumer market via Walmart.com. We are currently in the process of seeking regulatory approval to sell products into the U.S. Class III surgical market.
Recent Developments
 
The following developments in the Company’s business have occurred since the beginning of 2018:
 
 
· | In February 2018, the Company completed and submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) all materials relevant for the pre-market approval (“PMA”) for HemoStyp under the FDA’s new and innovative CtQ Pilot-Program as a Class III application for internal surgical procedures. The CtQ Pilot Program was created to identify products that have a chemical makeup of demonstrated safe interaction with the body – as evidenced by years of prior product usage and studies – to be approved for Class III internal surgical use. The FDA reviewed UHP’s HemoStyp as one of the participants for the program.

· | The Company’s 2” x 4” Trauma Gauze™ product has been selected as the feature component for a new Advanced Wound Care Kit for Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE DKS). With today’s environment when the unexpected can happen anywhere, both in the wild and in urban areas, having an advanced trauma kit can be the difference between survival and tragedy. The Hemostyp pouches have been included under the Field and Stream label and are available in their stores nationwide since February 2018. 
· | In January 2018, the Company’s distribution partner, Quantum Health Group, filed an application for Class III use in general internal surgical procedures with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (“MFDS”) in South Korea. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety provides the vision of "Safe Food and Drug, Healthy People, Well-being Society" and making extensive efforts to safeguard consumers and promote the public health by ensuring the safety of all foods, drugs, cosmetics, herbal medicines, and medical devices. Quantum received a response requiring additional data and testing. The Company intends to respond to the request and complete our application following the expected FDA Class III approval.

· | In March 2018, the Company obtained Class III and CE mark approval for HemoStyp in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises the 28 European Union members and certain other countries. Accordingly, HemoStyp was approved for use in internal surgical procedures in more than 30 countries. This approval expired in August of 2018 and a new application will be prepared in conjunction with the new CE standards for Class III following the expected FDA Class III approval. The EEA approval was granted following the provision of all required documentation to the relevant regulatory agencies. The CE marking– CE is an acronym for the French term "Conformité Européenne"– certifies that a product has met EEA health, safety, and environmental requirements, which ensure consumer safety. Manufacturers in the EEA and abroad must meet CE marking requirements where applicable to market their products in Europe. A manufacturer who has gone through the conformity assessment process may affix the CE mark to its product. With the CE marking, the product may be marketed throughout the EEA and certain other countries, with a combined population exceeding 517 million and a GDP greater than $17 trillion.

· | In July 2018, the Company announced that it has been accepted as a Walmart.com supplier and offers two HemoStyp wound care products for online retail sale. Hemostrips® Hemostatic Bandages and Boo-boo Strip Hemostatic Bandages. 
· | On August 8, 2018, the Company announced that its protocol submission for human testing had been reviewed by the FDA in furtherance of our efforts to achieve Class III approval for the product in the U.S. This FDA review was provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for protocol and hospital site approval. UHP started the human trial study in November. The IRB is a committee that is independent of the FDA, and that is formally designated to approve, monitor, and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans. The purpose of the IRB is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in a research study. The Company’s human trial protocol calls for the application of HemoStyp in abdominal, cardiovascular thoracic and vascular surgical procedures to control bleeding sites. Prior to finalizing its human trial protocol, we submitted a Q-Sub – a request for FDA review — to the FDA, in conjunction with its previously filed Class III PMA submission application. 
· | The IRB approved HemoStyp human trial is a prospective, non-inferiority, multi-center, randomized, open-label trial to observe HemoStyp in the management of bleeding during surgery; and, to assess the efficacy and safety of HemoStyp as an adjunct for management of secondary hemostasis in an operative setting. Our independently developed protocol has established endpoints for bleeding control. 
· | We expect that the human trials will be the last step to clear in obtaining FDA PMA Class III approval for HemoStyp. We have recruited a team of leading surgeons to conduct the study, and our lead investigator has successfully conducted over 20 medical device studies. We aim to complete this final regulatory stage as part of our strategy to supply the domestic and international hemostasis surgical markets. 
· | On October 25, 2018, the Company announced that, in connection with the FDA PMA Class III approval process for HemoStyp, UHP has been contacted by several medical technology companies that are active in the surgical equipment and hemostatic products sectors, and who had expressed an interest in the Company's products and business strategy. In response to these inbound contacts, and to maximize shareholder value, the Company's board of directors has determined to conduct a review of strategic alternatives, which include a potential sale of the Company, joint venture or other commercial partnership, or a standalone growth plan. To assist in this review, the Company has retained Société Générale to serve as financial advisor to the Company and it has retained the law firm of Ruskin Moscou Faltischek PC to assist in the strategic review. There can be no assurances that any specific transaction will occur as a result of the retention of these firms.

Our HemoStyp Gauze Products
 
HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze is a collagen-like natural substance created from chemically treated cellulose. It is an effective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding from open wounds and body cavities. The HemoStyp hemostatic material contains no chemical additives, thrombin or collagen, and is hypoallergenic. When the product comes in contact with blood it expands slightly and converts to an adhesive gel that subsequently dissolves into glucose and saline. Because of its purity and the fact that it simply degrades to non-toxic end products, HemoStyp does not cause significant delay in healing as do certain other hemostatic materials. Additional testing has shown HemoStyp to be 100% absorbable in 24 hours or less. Tests have also been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of HemoStyp in thoracic and abdominal procedures. The Company continues to test for the effectiveness and the IFU (Instructions for Use) for abdominal and thoracic procedures.
 
HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze is a flexible cloth-like material that is applied by folding the gauze as needed to fit the size of the wound or incision, and then placing the gauze onto the bleeding tissue. In surgical situations, the product converts to a transparent gel with a neutral pH level that allows the surgeon to monitor the coagulation process and also avoids damage to the surrounding tissue. In first responder or other non-surgical situations, putting a bandage on top of the gauze is optional and, in many cases, unnecessary. Since EMS (Emergency Medical Services) work is pre-hospital, rinsing the gauze out with saline or water is not necessary, as a wound will be debrided and possibly reopened prior to suturing at the hospital.
 
Our hemostatic gauze product line includes various configurations which have been developed to address the specific needs of our market segments and our existing customers, including the U.S. military. Our HemoStyp gauze products are sold in different sizes for use in superficial trauma cases, as a dental gauze and as a nasal dressing, and in a range of formats for veterinary applications, among others uses. The Company's hemostatic gauze product line now includes the following products:
 

· | Veterinary Market type Products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Dental gauze for oral surgery; 
· | Several formats of Trauma Gauze™ for battlefield trauma; Adhesive bandages for use by consumers on cuts and abrasions; and,
· | Island dressings to support intravenous procedures such as kidney dialysis.

Primary Strategy
 
We believe that the Class III surgical markets, both domestic and international, represent the most attractive market for our products due to the limited competition from other Class III approved ORC (Oxidized Regenerated Cellulose) products and the resulting premium pricing for hemostatic agents that can meet the demanding requirements of the human surgical environment. In addition, our preliminary tests lead us to believe that the HemoStyp technology can compete successfully against established market participants and allow us to gain market share. Given this assessment, we have devoted considerable resources in 2018 and currently to completing the FDA process and gaining access to this market in the U.S. 
 
In February 2018, the Company completed and submitted to the FDA all materials relevant for the pre-market approval (“PMA”) for HemoStyp as a Class III application for internal surgical procedures. The 2017 U.S. market for hemostatic products used in internal surgery procedures is estimated at in excess of US$7 billion, of which the market for ORC or similar mechanical hemostatic products is estimated to be US$3.38 billion. This market is expected to grow at 6.2% annually to reach $4.57 billion by 2023 (source: October 2018 Market Data Forecast). 
 
In anticipation of receiving Class III approval, our strategy is to devote resources and seek partnerships that allow us to penetrate this market along with the other markets to which the Company already has access. We are evaluating the best paths to rapidly grow our revenue and profits, which could include commercial partnerships and licensing agreement with established market participants, in addition or as an alternative to raising the necessary capital to establish and grow our own marketing and distribution capabilities. We will carefully evaluate the returns on investment in each addressable market to ensure the judicious deployment of our capital to create shareholder value. 
 
We believe that refocusing the Company to become a stronger, medical technology corporation with a patented technology will enhance the Company’s value and overall market strength and allows for revenue generation via organic growth. Nevertheless, we have engaged Société Générale as described under “Recent Developments” to advise the Company on potential strategic alternatives including the possible sale of the Company and/or its intellectual assets. In the event that a transaction is not completed on terms satisfactory to the Company, if at all, the Company would require substantial additional financing to execute an organic business development strategy addressing all of its intended markets.
 
Manufacturing and Packaging of our Products         
 
The Company's gauze products are manufactured to our specifications at various facilities. We have established various contract manufacturing facilities to replace our original agreement with Hemo Manufacturing. All of these facilities have been carefully vetted and have supplied multiple Quality Control program certificates and are registered FDA facilities. These facilities have been confirmed as part of our PMA submission, which includes the FDA inspection records of these facilities. We are finalizing the move of most of the Company’s manufacturing operation to the United States but will maintain an overseas supply solution for our adhesive retail products. 

 
Patents and Trademarks
 
In September 2012, the Company announced that its hemostatic gauze products were granted patent protection by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which patent protection currently runs through 2029. However, if our intellectual property positions are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or if we fail to prevail in future intellectual property litigation, our business could be adversely affected. We have created multiple variations of our gauze product and will protect each of these new generation platforms and product with additional intellectual property. Our success depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property rights. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. Also, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing our patent in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products.

Competition
 
The disposable medical supply market in the United States is dominated by large companies such as Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson and 3M Company. Our hemostatic gauze product will directly compete in the gauze markets dominated by these majors. However, the market for hemostatic products, which includes gauzes, gels, bandages and powders, is largely composed of smaller, privately-held companies with the exception of Johnson & Johnson, which manufactures SurgicelÒ. In this market, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to, and affected by, a variety of federal and state laws, regulations and policies.
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or distribution of pharmaceutical products. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of applicable laws and regulations. As a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products, we are subject to these laws and regulations. We must have all necessary licenses and other regulatory approvals and are required to be in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations. See “Recent Developments.”
 
In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. In addition, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (the "2007 Act") requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. These standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other technologies. The 2007 Act required the FDA to develop a standardized numerical identifier by April 1, 2010.
 
As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the healthcare delivery industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. Although there was substantial Federal legislation enacted during 2010 that impacted our healthcare system in the United States, we expect that the administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods in order to reform the healthcare system. Thus, we cannot predict the impact on us of the 2010 legislation and/or additional regulation governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare products that may be passed. Nor can we predict the impact on us of potential changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system, if any, when they may be adopted.
 
The costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Environmental Matters
 
Our business activities are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to water, air, hazardous substances and wastes that may restrict or limit such business activities. Although the Company does not currently directly manufacture its own products, we may still be subject to existing environmental laws by way of regulatory agencies or other third-party claimants. Examples of U.S. Federal environmental legislation that may have adverse effects on the Company include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, Compensation and Liability Act (aka CERCLA or Superfund) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. By no means do we certify this list as being complete, as there are many laws and regulations that exist or that may come to pass that we cannot foresee that may also have an impact on the Company. The multitude of regulations issued by federal, state, provincial and local administrative agencies can be burdensome and costly and we determined to change our business model as a result. There are currently no pending legal proceedings with any government regulatory agencies.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
In fiscal 2018 and 2017, we incurred $76,951 and $19,936, respectively, in research and development expenditures.
 
 Personnel
 
As of April 1, 2019, we have four full-time employees and up to eight additional consultants, excluding our eight Medical Advisory Board members.
