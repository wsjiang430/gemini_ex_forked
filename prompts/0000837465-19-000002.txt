Item 1.    Business Overview
Callaway Golf Company (the “Company” or “Callaway Golf”) was incorporated in California in 1982 with the main purpose of designing, manufacturing and selling high quality golf clubs. The Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1992, and in 1999, reincorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company has evolved over time from a manufacturer of golf clubs to a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium golf equipment and active lifestyle apparel, equipment and accessories. Over the past two and a half years, the Company grew its golf apparel and accessories business with the completion of the golf apparel joint venture in Japan in July 2016. In January and August of 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of OGIO international, Inc. ("OGIO") and TravisMathew, LLC ("TravisMathew"), respectively, which expanded its soft goods business to include lifestyle product lines that are complimentary to golf. OGIO products offer premium storage gear for sport and personal use as well as performance outerwear. TravisMathew offers a full line of premium lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories. Both these acquisitions provided a platform for the Company to grow its lifestyle products business. In January 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of JW Stargazer Holding GmbH, the owner of the international, premium outdoor apparel, footwear and equipment brand, Jack Wolfskin ("Jack Wolfskin"). This acquisition is expected to further enhance and grow the Company's lifestyle category and provide a platform for future growth in the active outdoor and urban outdoor categories. With these recent acquisitions, the Company is transforming the way it views its business as it carries out its plans to invest strategically in areas complimentary to golf, with a focus on establishing synergies and realizing efficiencies for the benefit of all of the Company's brands.

Product Design and Development
Product design at the Company is a result of the integrated efforts of its brand management, research and development, manufacturing and sales departments, all of which work together to generate new ideas for golf equipment. The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and has not limited itself in its research efforts by trying to duplicate designs that are traditional or conventional. The Company believes it has created a work environment in which new ideas are valued and explored. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company invested $40.8 million, $36.6 million and $33.3 million, respectively, in research and 
2

development. The Company intends to continue to invest substantial amounts in its research and development activities in connection with its development of new products.
The Company has the ability to create and modify product designs by using computer aided design (“CAD”) software, finite element analysis (”FEA”) software and structural optimization techniques employing Artificial Intelligence methods. Further, the Company utilizes a variety of testing equipment and computer software, including golf robots, launch monitors, a proprietary virtual test center, a proprietary performance analysis system, an indoor test range and other methods to develop and test its products. Through the use of these technologies, the Company has been able to innovate and enhance product performance at the same time accelerating the design, development and testing of new golf clubs and golf balls.
The Company's soft goods under the Callaway, OGIO and TravisMathew brands are designed and developed internally. Design specifications are sent to contract manufacturers who source the raw materials and build the products according to the specifications. 
For certain risks associated with product design and development, see below, “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Manufacturing and Distribution
The Company has its primary golf club assembly facility in Monterrey, Mexico, and maintains limited golf club assembly in its facilities in Carlsbad, California and Roanoke, Texas. The Company's golf clubs are also assembled in Tokyo, Japan, Swindon, England, Melbourne, Australia and other local markets based on regional demand for custom clubs. In addition, the Company utilizes golf club contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam.
In 2018, 2017 and 2016, most of the Company’s golf club assembly volume was made in regions outside of the United States. Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive, requires extensive global supply chain coordination and utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States. 
The Company has a golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and also utilizes golf ball contract manufacturers in Taiwan and China. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 60% of the golf ball unit volume was manufactured in regions outside of the United States. The overall golf ball manufacturing process utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States.
The Company utilizes third-party contract manufacturers for its Callaway, OGIO and TravisMathew soft goods products located in Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Thailand, and Peru.
The Company has its primary distribution center in Roanoke, Texas for the distribution of goods in North America, in addition to distribution centers in Huntington Beach, California, Toronto, Canada, Swindon, England and Melbourne, Australia, and third-party logistical operations in Evansville, Indiana, Tokyo, Japan, Shanghai, China, and Seoul, Korea to support the distribution needs of markets they serve.
Starting in January 2019, in connection with the completion of the Jack Wolfskin acquisition, the Company has a distribution center in Hamburg, Germany. 
Raw Materials
The Company periodically contracts purchases of raw materials from domestic and international suppliers in order to meet scheduled production needs. Raw materials include steel, titanium alloys, carbon fiber and various thermoplastic and thermoset materials for the manufacturing of golf clubs, and synthetic rubber, thermoplastics, zinc stearate, zinc oxide and lime stone for the manufacturing of golf balls. For certain risks associated with golf club and golf ball manufacturing, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A. 
Sales and Marketing
The Company generally sells its products to retailers, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to third-party distributors. The Company sells pre-owned golf products through its website www.callawaygolfpreowned.com. In addition, the Company sells Callaway Golf and Odyssey products, including Toulon Design by Odyssey, as well as OGIO and TravisMathew branded soft goods products directly to consumers through its websites www.callawaygolf.com, www.odysseygolf.com, www.ogio.com and www.travismathew.com. The Company also licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories, including Callaway Golf golf apparel, footwear, golf gloves, prescription eyewear and practice aids as well as OGIO branded bags. In addition, the Company has TravisMathew retail locations in the United 
3

States and retail, outlet and store-in-store locations in Japan in connection with the apparel joint venture which sells Callaway branded apparel, gear and accessories directly to consumers. The Company’s products are sold in the United States and in over 100 countries around the world. In January 2019, the Company acquired Jack Wolfskin, which sells Jack Wolfskin-branded apparel, gear and accessories through its retail locations throughout Europe and China, and through its website www.jack-wolfskin.com.
Sales in the United States
Of the Company’s total net sales, approximately 57%, 54% and 51% was derived from sales to customers within the United States in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company primarily sells its golf equipment and active lifestyle apparel, equipment and accessories under the Callaway, OGIO and TravisMathew brands to both on- and off-course golf retailers and sporting goods retailers who sell quality golf and lifestyle products and who can also provide a level of customer service appropriate for the sale of golf equipment. TravisMathew branded apparel and accessories are also sold at certain department stores and at its retail locations. Sales of the Company’s products in the United States are made and supported by full-time regional field representatives and in-house sales and customer service representatives. Most regions in the United States are covered by both a field representative and a dedicated in-house sales representative who work together to initiate and maintain relationships with customers through frequent telephone calls and in-person visits. The Company also sells its products through Internet retailers, and certain products to mass merchants. 
In addition, the Company sells to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted on certain of the Company’s golf equipment, as well as on golf bags. The Company imprints the logos on the majority of these corporate products, thereby retaining control over the quality of the process and final product. The Company also pays a commission to certain on- and off-course professionals and retailers with whom it has a relationship for corporate sales that originate through such professionals and retailers.
The Company also has a separate team of club fitting specialists who focus on the Company’s custom club sales. A portion of the Company’s custom club sales are generated from the utilization of club fitting programs, such as performance centers, which utilize high-speed cameras and precision software to capture relevant swing data. All performance centers and participating on- and off-course retail stores are equipped with custom fitting systems that incorporate the use of an extensive variety of clubhead and shaft combinations in order to find a set of golf clubs that fits a golfer’s personal specifications. The Company believes that offering golfers the opportunity to increase performance with custom club specifications increases sales and promotes brand loyalty.
The Company maintains various sales programs, including a Preferred Retailer Program. The Preferred Retailer Program offers potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training.
Sales Outside of the United States
Of the Company’s total net sales, approximately 43%, 46% and 49% were derived from sales for distribution outside of the United States in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company does business (either directly or through its subsidiaries and distributors) in over 100 countries around the world. The Company sells its full line of Callaway Golf and Odyssey golf equipment as well as OGIO branded products internationally. In addition, the Company sells Callaway Golf apparel, accessories and certain golf products at its retail locations in Japan through the apparel joint venture.
The majority of the Company’s international sales are made through its wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Japan, Europe, Korea, Canada, Australia, China and India. In addition to sales through its subsidiaries, the Company also sells through its network of distributors in over 60 foreign countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and in numerous countries in Central and South America. Prices of golf clubs and balls for sales by distributors outside of the United States generally reflect an export pricing discount to compensate international distributors for selling and distribution costs. A change in the Company’s relationship with significant distributors could negatively impact the volume of the Company’s international sales.
The Company’s sales programs in foreign countries are specifically designed based upon local laws and competitive conditions. Some of the sales programs utilized include the custom club fitting experiences and the Preferred Retailer Program or variations of those programs employed in the United States as described above.
Conducting business outside of the United States subjects the Company to increased risks inherent in international business. These risks include but are not limited to foreign currency risks, increased difficulty in protecting the Company’s intellectual property rights and trade secrets, unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including any incremental restrictions on imports or increased import tariffs, and social, economic or political instability. For further discussion of the risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.

Sales of Pre-Owned Clubs
The Company sells certified pre-owned golf products in addition to golf-related accessories through its website www.callawaygolfpreowned.com. The Company generally acquires the pre-owned products through the Company’s Trade In! Trade Up! program, which gives golfers the opportunity to trade in their used Callaway Golf clubs and certain competitor golf clubs at authorized Callaway Golf retailers or through the Callaway Golf Pre-Owned website for credit toward the purchase of new or pre-owned Callaway Golf equipment. 
Direct to Consumer Sales
The Company offers the full line of Callaway Golf and Odyssey golf equipment products, including drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, putters and golf balls, in addition to golf-related accessories, through its websites www.callawaygolf.com and www.odysseygolf.com.

Advertising and Promotion
The Company develops and executes its advertising and promotional campaigns for its products based on the Company’s global brand principles. Within the United States, the Company has focused its advertising efforts mainly on television commercials, primarily on The Golf Channel and on network television during golf telecasts, web-based advertising, and printed advertisements in national magazines, such as Golf Magazine, Sports Illustrated and Golf Digest, as well as in-store advertising. The Company also engages in non-traditional marketing activities through strategic investments in third parties including Topgolf International, Inc. doing business as the Topgolf Entertainment Group ("Topgolf").
Advertising of the Company’s products outside of the United States is generally handled by the Company’s subsidiaries, and while it is based on the Company’s global brand principles, the local execution is tailored to each region based on its unique consumer market and lifestyles. 
In addition, the Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to promote the Company’s products. The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional golf tours to promote the Company’s golf club and golf ball products as well as golf bags and various golf accessories. For certain risks associated with such endorsements, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Competition
The golf club markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive and are served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names. With respect to drivers, fairway woods and irons, the Company’s major competitors are TaylorMade, Ping, Acushnet (Titleist brand), Puma (Cobra brand), SRI Sports Limited (Cleveland and Srixon brands), Mizuno, Bridgestone, and Parsons Xtreme Golf (PXG). For putters, the Company’s major competitors are Acushnet (Titleist brand), Ping and TaylorMade. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in every golf club market in which it competes.
The golf ball business is also highly competitive. There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including Acushnet (Titleist and Pinnacle brands), SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands), Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands), TaylorMade and others. These competitors compete for market share in the golf ball business, with Acushnet having a market share of over 50% of the golf ball business in the United States and a leading position in certain other regions outside the United States. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in the golf ball category.
For both golf clubs and golf balls, the Company generally competes on the basis of technology, quality, performance, customer service and price. In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Company’s response to such factors, management receives and evaluates Company-generated market trends for U.S. and foreign markets, as well as periodic public and customized market research for the U.S. and U.K. markets from Golf Datatech that include trends from certain on- and off-course retailers. In addition, the Company utilizes GfK Group for markets in Japan.
5

In addition, the Company's competitors in the soft goods market, including apparel, gear and golf accessories, are generally other golf companies and premium golf apparel companies, as well as specialty retailers.
For certain risks associated with competition, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Seasonality of Company's Business
Golf Club and Golf Balls
In most of the regions where the Company conducts business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year-round, except in a few markets, with many of the Company’s on-course customers closing for the cold weather months. The Company’s golf club and golf ball businesses are therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its golf club and golf ball products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. Second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. Third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but can also include smaller new product launches, typically resulting in lower sales than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. Fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company’s key regions. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year product launch, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company’s sales from its Golf Clubs and Golf Balls operating segments and most, if not all, of its profitability from these segments generally occurs during the first half of the year. 
Gear, Accessories and Other
Sales of the Company's golf gear and accessories generally follow the same seasonality as golf clubs and golf balls, and are therefore generally higher during the first half of the year when the game of golf is mostly played. Sales of lifestyle gear and apparel are generally higher in the second and third quarters during the spring/summer season. Golf apparel sales are higher in the third and fourth quarters due to a strong fall/winter season in Japan. With the recent acquisition of Jack Wolfskin in January 2019, the Company anticipates increased sales of lifestyle apparel in the third and fourth quarters related to the fall/winter season.
Environmental and Social Responsibility
 By being active and visible in the community and by embracing the principles of environmental stewardship, the Company believes it is acting in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.
Environmental Matters
The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, “Environmental Laws”). In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws. In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts. In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations. As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations. 
The Company endeavors to adhere to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws. The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico. The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance. The Company also conducts third party Social, Safety and Environmental Responsibility Audits of its global supply chain. The audits ensure compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and that responsible manufacturing practices are maintained within the global supply chain.
6

Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.
Sustainability
The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner. In this regard, the Company has an environmental sustainability program which focuses on the reductions of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, reductions of hazardous waste, reductions in water usage, improved recycling and development programs which involve the elimination or reduction of undesirable chemicals and solvents in favor of safer and environmentally preferred alternatives. These efforts cross divisional lines and are visible in the following areas within the Company:

• | Facilities through the partnership with local utilities to implement energy reduction initiatives such as energy efficient lighting, demand response energy management and heating, ventilation and air conditioning optimization;


• | Manufacturing through lean initiatives and waste minimization;


• | Product development through specification of environmentally preferred substances;


• | Logistics improvements and packaging minimization; and


• | Supply chain management through Social, Safety and Environmental Responsibility audits of suppliers.


• | Callaway participates in the UPS Smartway program, which promotes cost effective and environmentally efficient freight transportation.

Community Giving
The Company also has two existing programs focusing on the community: the Callaway Golf Company Foundation and the Callaway Golf Company Employee Community Giving Program. Through these programs the Company and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services. Information on both of these programs is available on the Company’s website www.callawaygolf.com.
Intellectual Property
The Company is the owner of approximately 3,500 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and over 1,600 U.S. and foreign patents relating to the Company’s products, product designs, manufacturing processes and research and development concepts. Other patent and trademark applications are pending and await registration. In addition, the Company owns various other protectable rights under copyright, trade dress and other statutory and common laws. The Company’s intellectual property rights are very important to the Company, and the Company seeks to protect such rights through the registration of trademarks and utility and design patents, the maintenance of trade secrets and the creation of trade dress. When necessary and appropriate, the Company enforces its rights through litigation. Information regarding current litigation matters in connection with intellectual property is contained in Note 12 “Commitments & Contingencies—Legal Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
The Company’s patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. The Company’s trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to become generic. For certain risks associated with intellectual property, see “Risk Factors” contained in Item 1A.
Licensing
The Company, in exchange for a royalty fee, licenses its trademarks and service marks to third parties for use on products such as golf apparel and footwear, and practice aids. With respect to its line of golf apparel, the Company has current licensing arrangements with Perry Ellis International for a complete line of men’s and women’s apparel for distribution in certain retail channels in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. With respect to OGIO-branded bags, the Company has a licensing arrangement with SanMar Corporation for OGIO products and SanMar-designed, OGIO-branded products for distribution in the corporate channel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition, the Company licenses its trademark to its joint venture in Japan for a full line of Callaway Golf apparel, footwear and other select items. With respect to the footwear lines, the Company has a licensing arrangement with Klone Lab, LLC for a complete line of men’s and women’s golf footwear for distribution in certain retail channels in the United States and Canada.
In addition, the Company has also licensed its trademarks to, among others, (i) IZZO Golf for practice aids and sunglasses and (ii) Walman Optical for a line of prescription Callaway eyewear.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 2,400 and 2,100 full-time and part-time employees, respectively. The increase in the Company's headcount was primarily due to business growth in 2018. The Company employs temporary manufacturing workers as needed based on labor demands that fluctuate with the Company's seasonality.
The Company’s golf ball manufacturing employees in Chicopee, Massachusetts are unionized and are covered under a collective bargaining agreement, which expires on September 30, 2022. In addition, certain of the Company’s production employees in Australia and Mexico are also unionized. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
