Item 1. Business
Axon Enterprise, Inc. may be referred to as “the Company,” “Axon,” “we,” or “our.” We were incorporated in Arizona in September 1993 as ICER Corporation. We changed our name to AIR TASER, Inc. in December 1993 and to TASER International, Incorporated in April 1998. In January 2001, we reincorporated in Delaware as TASER International, Inc., and in April 2017, changed our name to Axon Enterprise, Inc.
Overview
Axon is a market-leading provider of law enforcement technology solutions. Our core mission is to protect life. We fulfill that mission through developing hardware and software products that advance the long term objectives of a) obsoleting the bullet, b) reducing social conflict, and c) enabling a fair and effective justice system.
We believe we are creating a sustainable and profitable business model while solving society's most challenging problems. Financially, we seek to sell our solutions via subscription plans that generate recurring revenue and cash flow and demonstrate leverage as we scale.
Our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona houses our executive management, sales, marketing, certain engineering, manufacturing, and other administrative support functions. We also have a software engineering development center located in Seattle, Washington, and subsidiaries located in Australia, Canada, Finland, Hong Kong, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. 
Axon's operations comprise two reportable segments:
1)TASER: Axon is the market leader in the development, manufacture and sale of conducted energy weapons (CEWs), also known as conducted energy devices (CEDs), which we sell under our brand name, TASER. Research has shown that the TASER device is the most effective less than lethal force option, with the lowest likelihood of injury to officers and assailants. Since our inception in 1993, the TASER has been adopted by a majority of U.S. police departments and is used daily to help keep communities safe.
2)Software and Sensors: Axon is the market leader in on-officer body (Axon Body and Flex) and in-car (Axon Fleet) cameras as well as cloud-based digital evidence management software (Evidence.com). We develop, manufacture and sell fully integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions that enable law enforcement to capture, securely store, manage, share and analyze video and other digital evidence. Of the 69 largest metropolitan area police departments in the U.S., 46 are on the Axon network.
Further information about our reportable segments and sales by geographic region is included in Notes 1 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For backlog by reportable segment, refer to Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Strategic Growth Areas
In 2018, Axon invested heavily in four strategic growth areas, which were 1) TASER devices, 2) Sensors hardware, including on-officer body cameras and Axon Fleet in-car video systems, and our Axon Evidence connected software network, 3) Axon Records and 4) computer-aided dispatch software. The latter three growth areas are reported in our Software and Sensors segment.
These four strategic growth areas exist within an estimated $8.4 billion total addressable market, comprising CEWs ($1.8 billion), hardware sensors ($0.8 billion), and cloud-based public safety software ($5.8 billion.)
A description of each growth area follows:
•TASER devices: In December 2018, we began shipping TASER 7, which we believe is the most effective CEW ever made and is the first TASER device that works with a dock, allowing device logs to upload to our cloud-

based digital evidence management system. We are continuing to invest to make our TASER CEWs more capable and more connected over time.
•Axon sensors hardware and Axon Evidence digital evidence management software: We are continuing to invest in connected sensors to improve and create the next generation of body-worn and in-car cameras. Additionally, we are continuing to invest heavily in Axon Evidence features and roll out updates to Axon Evidence customers on a regular basis, meaning that our software solutions improve over time.
•Axon Records management systems: We are developing a cloud-based records management system, known in the law enforcement industry as an RMS, that is intuitive and easy-to-use. We believe that body camera video is a key source of truth on what transpired during any incident, and therefore should be the heart of the incident record. Axon Records will integrate seamlessly with the body camera video stored in Axon Evidence, and will leverage the data we are hosting to unlock value-added services for our customers.
•Computer-aided dispatch software: We aim to improve the dispatch market by developing software, known in the industry as computer-aided dispatch, or CAD. This type of software assists emergency call center operators in dispatching police, fire or medical services to respond to incidents. Our CAD software will seamlessly integrate with Axon Records and Axon Evidence, allowing for easier and more streamlined workflows for dispatchers, first responders, detectives, and the justice system.
Sales and Distribution
Axon's direct sales force and strong customer relationships represent key strategic advantages. The majority of our revenues are generated via direct sales, including our online store, although we do leverage distribution partners and third-party resellers.
Of the approximately 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the US, we have a customer relationship with approximately 17,000. Axon has dedicated sales representatives for the 1,200 largest agencies, which account for 70% to 80% of patrol officers. The remaining agencies are served via our telesales team as well as distributors. Internationally, we began focusing on a direct sales strategy in 2017, and in 2018 we made significant strides toward building out our international direct sales force, particularly in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
No customer represented more than 10% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Governmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for reasons including, but not limited to, non-appropriation of funds.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We perform light manufacturing, final assembly, and final test operations at our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. We have continued to maintain both our ISO 9001 and our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.
We obtain many of our components from single source suppliers; however, because we own the injection molded component tooling used in their production, we believe we could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring significant production delays. For additional discussion of sources and availability of raw materials, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We provide limited manufacturer's warranties on our CEWs and Axon devices. For additional information about our warranties, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition
TASER: Law Enforcement, Corrections and Private Security Markets: Our CEWs compete with a variety of other less-lethal alternatives, including rubber bullets or rubber baton rounds, pepper spray, mace, traditional stun guns, and police batons and night sticks. TASER devices offer advanced technology, versatility, portability, effectiveness, built-in accountability systems, and low injury rates, which enable us to compete effectively against other less-lethal alternatives.
The primary competitive factors in this market include a device’s accuracy, effectiveness, safety, cost, ease of use and an exceptional customer experience. We are aware of competitors providing competing CEW products primarily in international markets.
TASER: Private Citizen Market: In the private citizen market, these devices primarily compete with firearms, but also with other less lethal self-defense options such as pepper spray. The primary competitive factors in this market include a device’s cost, effectiveness, safety and ease of use.
Cameras & Software: Video Evidence Market: In the body-worn camera and in-car video markets, our competition primarily includes Motorola Solutions, Panasonic Corp., Reveal Media, Watchguard, L3 Mobile-Vision, Coban Technologies, Digital Ally, Getac and Utility Associates. We also compete with consumer wearable camera makers including GoPro and Garmin.
Our cloud based digital evidence management system, Axon Evidence, competes with both cloud-based platforms and on-premises based systems designed by third-parties or in-house by an agency's technology staff.
Key competitive factors in this market include product performance, product features, battery life, product quality and warranty, total cost of ownership, data security, data and information work flows, company reputation and financial strength, and relationships with customers.
Records Management and Computer-Aided Dispatch: The RMS and CAD markets are highly competitive and highly fragmented. Incumbent software providers include Motorola Solutions, Tyler Technologies, Central Square Technologies (formerly Superion, TriTech and Aptean), Hexagon AB, Niche Technology Inc., ALEN Inc., Caliber Public Safety (parent, Harris Systems USA), and Mark 43 Inc. 
Seasonality 
We have historically experienced higher net sales in our second and fourth quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due primarily to municipal budget cycles. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. However, historical seasonal patterns, municipal budgets or historical patterns of product introductions should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net sales or financial performance.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including restrictions on the presence of certain substances in electronic products. Refer to Section 1A, Risk Factors under the heading “Environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.”
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property with U.S. and international patents and trademarks. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2018, we hold 158 U.S. patents, 70 U.S. registered trademarks, 102 international patents, and 293 international registered trademarks, and also have numerous patents and trademarks pending. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for 
6

particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. We have the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “TASER.com”, “Axon.com”, “Axon.net”, “Evidence.com” and “Axon.io.”
Confidentiality agreements are used with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,155 full-time employees and 231 temporary employees. The breakdown of our full-time employees by department was as follows: 217 direct manufacturing employees, 360 research and development employees, 336 administrative and manufacturing support employees and 242 employees within sales, marketing, communications and training. Of the 231 temporary employees, approximately 80% worked in direct manufacturing roles. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
