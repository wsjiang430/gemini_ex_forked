In connection therewith, B. Riley and Vintage RTO, L.P., an affiliate of Vintage Parent (“Vintage Merger Guarantor”), entered into a Limited Guarantee dated as of June 17, 2018 (the “Limited Guarantee”), in favor of Rent-A-Center, pursuant to which B. Riley and Vintage Merger Guarantor (together, the “Merger Guarantors”) agreed to guarantee, jointly and severally, to Rent-A-Center the payment, performance and discharge of all of the liabilities and obligations of Vintage Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement when required in accordance with the Merger Agreement (the “Guaranteed Obligations”), including without limitation, (i) termination fees in the amount of $126.5 million due to Rent-A-Center if the Merger Agreement is properly terminated (the “Termination Fee”); and (ii) reimbursement and indemnification obligations when required (collectively, the “Guarantee Obligations”), provided, that the liability under the Limited Guarantee shall not exceed $128.5 million.
 
In connection with the execution of the Limited Guarantee, the Company entered into a Mutual Indemnity/Contribution Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2018 (the “Mutual Indemnity Agreement”), with the Vintage Merger Guarantor and Samjor Family, LP (collectively, the “Vintage Indemnity Parties”). Under the Mutual Indemnity Agreement, the Vintage Guarantors agreed, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless B. Riley and its affiliates from damages and liabilities arising out of the Guarantee Obligations, other than those caused B. Riley’s failure to fund under their debt or equity commitments.
 
On December 18, 2018, Rent-A-Center purported to terminate the Merger Agreement because the end date of the agreement was allegedly not extended prior to December 17, 2018 by Vintage Parent. Rent-A-Center delivered notice of such termination to Vintage Parent, and notified Vintage Parent of its obligation under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay Rent-A-Center the Termination Fee within three business days.
 
On December 18, 2018, Vintage Capital Management, LLC, an affiliate of Vintage Parent (“Vintage Capital”), delivered a letter to Rent-A-Center stating that Rent-A-Center’s purported termination of the Merger Agreement is invalid, that it believes the Merger Agreement remains in effect.  On December 21, 2018, Vintage Capital filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court”) challenging Rent-A-Center’s purported termination of the Merger Agreement and demand for payment of the Termination Fee. The relief sought by Vintage Capital includes declaratory judgements that the Merger Agreement has not been terminated and remains in full force and effect, that Rent-A-Center has breached its obligations under the Merger Agreement and is not excused from failing to comply with its obligations thereunder and that the Termination Fee is an unenforceable penalty.
 
On December 28, 2018, Rent-A-Center provided each of B. Riley and the Vintage Merger Guarantors with a written request under the Limited Guarantee (a “Performance Demand”), to promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, pay to Rent-A-Center the Guaranteed Obligations (including the Termination Fee) in full.
 
On December 30, 2018, B. Riley filed a motion in the Court to intervene in the above referenced case filed by Vintage Capital pursuant to which B. Riley is seeking declaratory judgments, among other things, that the parties agreed to extend the End Date under the Merger Agreement and that Rent-A-Center is estopped from terminating the Merger Agreement, that Rent-A-Center has breached the Merger Agreement and its obligations of good faith and fair dealing in connection with consummating the Merger, and that the Termination Fee is an unenforceable penalty. B. Riley is also seeking an award of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and such other further relief as the Court finds equitable and appropriate.
 
At a hearing held on December 31, 2018, the Court stated that it would grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo, which order would prohibit Rent-A-Center from engaging in certain transactions pending an expedited trial on the merits. On January 3, 2019, the Court granted B. Riley’s motion to intervene in the Vintage Capital case and on January 7, 2019, the Court granted a temporary restraining order restricting Rent-A-Center from engaging in certain transactions prior to the trial on the merits scheduled for February 11, 2019.  On February 11th and 12th, a trial was held in Delaware, post-trial briefs were filed on February 22, 2019 and March 1, 2019. A post-trial hearing has been scheduled for March 11, 2019. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the Court will rule in favor of the Performance Demand. The amount of possible loss is not estimable; however, the range of loss could be from $0 to $128.5 million.


On November 14, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire shares of National Holdings Corporation (“National Holdings”), a Nasdaq-listed issuer, from Fortress Biotech, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price totaling approximately $22.9 million. The transaction was completed in two tranches. In the first tranche, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company acquired shares representing 24% of the total outstanding shares of National Holdings. The second tranche was contingent upon receipt of the approval of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., which was obtained in the first quarter of 2019. As a result of the closing of the second tranche, the Company now holds 49% of the outstanding shares of National Holdings. The equity ownership in National Holdings is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Great American Group
 
Retail Store Liquidations and Wholesale and Industrial Liquidations
 
We enable our clients to quickly and efficiently dispose of under-performing assets and generate cash from excess inventory by conducting or assisting in retail store closings, going out of business sales, bankruptcy sales and fixture sales. Financial institution and other capital providers rely on us to maximize recovery rates in distressed asset sales and in retail bankruptcy situations. Additionally, healthy, mature retailers utilize our proven inventory management and strategic disposition solutions, relying on our extensive network of retail professionals, to close unproductive stores and dispose of surplus inventory and fixtures as existing stores are updated. 
 
We often conduct large retail liquidations that entail significant capital requirements through collaborative arrangements with other liquidators. By entering into an agreement with one or more collaborators, we are able to bid on larger engagements that we could not conduct on our own due to the significant capital outlay involved, number of independent contractors required or financial risk associated with the particular engagement. We act as the lead partner in many of the collaborative arrangements that we enter into, meaning that we have primary responsibility for the due diligence, contract negotiation and execution of the engagement.
 
We design and implement customized disposition programs for our clients seeking to convert excess wholesale and industrial inventory and operational assets into capital. We dispose of a wide array of assets including, among others, equipment related to transportation, heavy mobile construction, energy exploration and services, metal fabrication, food processing, semiconductor fabrication, and distribution services. We manage projects of all sizes and scopes across a variety of asset categories. We believe that our databases of information regarding potential buyers that we have collected from past transactions and engagements, our nationwide name recognition and experience with alternative distribution channels allow us to provide superior wholesale and industrial disposition services.
 
Great American Group provides the foregoing services to clients on a guarantee, fee or outright purchase basis.
 
Guarantee. When providing services on a guarantee basis, we guarantee the client a specific recovery often expressed as a percentage of retail inventory value or wholesale inventory cost or, in the case of machinery or equipment, a set dollar amount. This guarantee is often required to be supported by a letter of credit, a cash deposit or a combination thereof. Cash deposits are typically funded in part with available cash together with short term borrowings under our credit facilities. Often when we provide auction or liquidation services on a guarantee basis, we do so through a collaborative arrangement with other service providers. In this situation, each collaborator agrees to provide a certain percentage of the guaranteed amount to the client through a combination of letters of credit, cash and financing. If we are engaged individually, we receive 100% of the net profit, less debt financing fees, sale related expenses (if any) and any share of the profits due to the client as a result of any profit sharing arrangement entered into based on a pre-negotiated formula. If the engagement was conducted through a collaborative arrangement, the profits or losses are divided among us and our partner or partners as set forth in the agreement governing the collaborative arrangement. If the net sales proceeds after expenses are less than the guarantee, we, together with our partners if the engagement was conducted through a collaborative arrangement, are responsible for the shortfall and will recognize a loss on the engagement.
Fee. When we provide services on a fee basis, clients pay a pre-negotiated flat fee for the services provided, a percentage of asset sales generated or a combination of both.
Outright Purchase. When providing services on an outright purchase basis, we purchase the assets from the client and typically sell them at auction, orderly liquidation, through a third-party broker or, less frequently, as augmented inventory in conjunction with another liquidation that we are conducting. In an outright purchase, we take, together with any collaboration partners, title to the assets and absorb the profit or loss associated with the asset disposition.
 
The retail store liquidations and wholesale and industrial asset dispositions business of Great American Group described above is reported in our Auction and Liquidation segment for financial reporting purposes.

Over the past several years revenues from paid subscription services have declined year over year as a result of a decline in the number of paid subscribers for our services.  Management believes the decline in paid subscriber accounts is primarily attributable to the industry trends of consumers switching from dial-up Internet access to high speed Internet access such as cable and DSL.  Management expects revenues in the Principal Investments - United Online and magicJack segment to continue to decline year over year.

Competition
 
B. Riley FBR, B. Riley Wealth Management and GlassRatner
 
We face intense competition for our Capital Markets services. Since the mid-1990s, there has been substantial consolidation among U.S. and global financial institutions. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other diversified financial services firms have merged with other financial institutions or have established or acquired broker-dealers. During 2008, the failure or near-collapse of a number of very large financial institutions led to the acquisition of several of the most sizeable U.S. investment banking firms, consolidating the financial industry to an even greater extent. Currently, our competitors are other investment banks, bank holding companies, brokerage firms, merchant banks and financial advisory firms. Our focus on our target industries also subjects us to direct competition from a number of specialty securities firms and smaller investment banking boutiques that specialize in providing services to these industries. 
 
The industry trend toward consolidation has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of many of our competitors. Our larger and better-capitalized competitors may be better able than we are to respond to changes in the investment banking industry, to recruit and retain skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do, including loans, deposit-taking and insurance, in addition to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, all of which may enhance their competitive position relative to us. These firms also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in downward pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the trend in the equity underwriting business toward multiple book runners and co-managers has increased the competitive pressure in the investment banking industry and has placed downward pressure on average transaction fees. 
 
As we seek to expand our asset management business, we face competition in the pursuit of investors for our investment funds, in the identification and completion of investments in attractive portfolio companies or securities, and in the recruitment and retention of skilled asset management professionals.
 
Great American Group
 
We also face intense competition in our other service areas. While some competitors are unique to specific service offerings, some competitors cross multiple service offerings. A number of companies provide services or products to the Auction and Liquidation and Valuation and Appraisal markets, and existing and potential clients can, or will be able to, choose from a variety of qualified service providers. Some of our competitors may even be able to offer discounts or other preferred pricing arrangements. In a cost-sensitive environment, such arrangements may prevent us from acquiring new clients or new engagements with existing clients. Some of our competitors may be able to negotiate secure alliances with clients and affiliates on more favorable terms, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns or to the development of technology systems than us. In addition, new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies with respect to the online auction business may increase the competitive pressures on us. We must also compete for the services of skilled professionals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures we face could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

We face competition for our retail services from traditional liquidators as well as Internet-based liquidators such as overstock.com and eBay. Our wholesale and industrial services competitors include traditional auctioneers and fixed site auction houses that may specialize in particular industries or geographic regions as well as other large, prestigious or well-recognized auctioneers. We also face competition and pricing pressure from the internal remarketing groups of our clients and potential clients and from companies that may choose to liquidate or auction assets and/or excess inventory without assistance from service providers like us. We face competition for our Valuation and Appraisal services from large accounting, consulting and other professional service firms as well as other valuation, appraisal and advisory firms.
 
United Online
 
The U.S. market for Internet and broadband services is highly competitive. We compete with numerous providers of broadband services, as well as other dial-up Internet access providers. Our principal competitors for broadband services include, among others, local exchange carriers, wireless and satellite service providers, cable service providers, and broadband resellers. These competitors include established providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Our principal dial-up Internet access competitors include established online service and content providers, such as AOL and MSN, and independent national Internet service providers, such as EarthLink. We believe the primary competitive factors in the Internet access industry are speed, price, coverage area, ease of use, scope of services, quality of service, and features. Our dial-up Internet access services do not compete favorably with broadband services with respect to certain of these factors, including, but not limited to, speed.
 
magicJack 
 
The principal competitors for our products and services include the traditional telephone service providers, such as AT&T, Inc., CenturyLink, Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., which provide telephone service using the public switched telephone network. Certain of these traditional providers have also added, or are planning to add, broadband telephone services to their existing telephone and broadband offerings. We also face, or expect to face, competition from cable companies, such as Cablevision Systems Corp., Charter Communications, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, Inc. and Time Warner Cable (a division of Time Warner Inc.), which offer broadband telephone services to their existing cable television and broadband offerings. Further, wireless providers, including AT&T Mobility, Inc., Sprint Corporation, T-Mobile USA Inc., and Verizon Wireless, Inc. offer services that some customers may prefer over wireline-based service. In the future, as wireless companies continue to offer services at lower prices, their services may become more attractive to customers as a replacement for broadband or wireline-based phone service.
 
We face competition on magicJack device sales from Apple, Samsung, Motorola and other manufacturers of smart phones, tablets and other hand held wireless devices. Also, we compete against established alternative voice communication providers, such as Vonage, Google Voice, Ooma, and Skype, which is another non-interconnected voice provider, and may face competition from other large, well-capitalized Internet companies. In addition, we compete with independent broadband telephone service providers.
 
Regulation
 
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition, numerous states and municipalities regulate the conduct of auctions and the liability of auctioneers. We and/or our auctioneers are licensed or bonded in the following states where we conduct, or have conducted, retail, wholesale or industrial asset auctions: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington. In addition, we are licensed or obtain permits in cities and/or counties where we conduct auctions, as required. If we conduct an auction in a state where we are not licensed or where reciprocity laws do not exist, we will work with an auctioneer of record in such state.
 
As a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of most aspects of our business by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations and securities exchanges. The laws, rules and regulations comprising the regulatory framework are constantly changing, as are the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. The effect of any such changes cannot be predicted and may direct the manner of our operations and affect our profitability.
 
B. Riley FBR and B. Riley Wealth Management, our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to regulations governing every aspect of the securities business, including the execution of securities transactions; capital requirements; record-keeping and reporting procedures; relationships with customers, including the handling of cash and margin accounts; the experience of and training requirements for certain employees; and business interactions with firms that are not members of regulatory bodies.

B. Riley FBR and B. Riley Wealth Management are registered as securities broker-dealers with the SEC and are members of FINRA. FINRA is a self-regulatory body composed of members such as our broker-dealer subsidiary that have agreed to abide by the rules and regulations of FINRA. FINRA may expel, fine and otherwise discipline member firms and their employees. B. Riley FBR and B. Riley Wealth Management are licensed as broker-dealers in 50 states in the U.S., requiring us to comply with the laws, rules and regulations of each such state. Each state may revoke the license to conduct securities business, fine and otherwise discipline broker-dealers and their employees. We are also registered with NASDAQ and must comply with its applicable rules.
 
B. Riley FBR and B. Riley Wealth Management are also subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiaries. The Uniform Net Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid. In addition, B. Riley FBR and B. Riley Wealth Management are subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital.
 
We are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act), which imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and customer verification, and other compliance policies and procedures. The conduct of research analysts is also the subject of rule-making by the SEC, FINRA and the federal government through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These regulations require certain disclosures by, and restrict the activities of, research analysts and broker-dealers, among others. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the USA Patriot Act, criminal penalties.
 
Our asset management subsidiaries, B. Riley Capital Management, LLC and B. Riley Wealth Management are SEC-registered investment advisers, and accordingly subject to regulation by the SEC. Requirements under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 include record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, and prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
 
Various regulators, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators and attorneys general, are conducting both targeted and industry-wide investigations of certain practices relating to the financial services industry, including marketing, sales practices, valuation practices, asset managers, and market and compensation arrangements. These investigations, which have been highly publicized, have involved mutual fund companies, broker-dealers, hedge funds, investors and others.
 
In addition, the SEC staff has conducted studies with respect to soft dollar practices in the brokerage and asset management industries and proposed interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices.
 
In July 2010, Congress enacted Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank institutes a wide range of reforms that will impact financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. In addition, the legislation mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. Many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank are subject to further rulemaking procedures and studies and will take effect over several years. As a result, we cannot assess the impact of these new legislative and regulatory changes on our business at the present time.
 
UOL is subject to a number of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to taxation, bulk email or “spam,” advertising, user privacy and data protection, consumer protection, antitrust, export, and unclaimed property. In addition, proposed laws and regulations relating to some or all of the foregoing, as well as to other areas affecting our businesses, are continuously debated and considered for adoption in the U.S. and other countries, and such laws and regulations could be adopted in the future. For additional information, see "Risk Factors," which appears in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
In the United States, magicJack is subject to federal regulation under the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or the “Commission”) and various state and local regulations. magicJack provides broadband telephone services using VoIP technology and/or services treated as information services by the FCC. magicJack is also licensed as a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (“CLEC”) and is subject to extensive federal and state regulation applicable to CLECs. The FCC has to date asserted limited statutory jurisdiction and regulatory authority over the operations and offerings of certain providers of broadband telephone services, including non-interconnected VoIP. FCC regulations may now, or may in the future, be applied to magicJack’s broadband telephone operations. Other FCC regulations apply to magicJack because it provides international calling capability. Some of the magicJack’s operations are also subject to regulation by state public utility commissions (“PUCs”).
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, providing an exemption from U.S. federal tax for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $13.1 million, related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and tax expense related to non-U.S. activities resulting from the Tax Act.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the provisional amounts recognized at December 31, 2017 and the impact was not significant.  See Note 15 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information.

Acquisition of magicJack
 
On November 9, 2017, we entered into the magicJack Merger Agreement with B. R. Acquisition Ltd., an Israeli corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub would merge with and into magicJack, with magicJack continuing as the surviving corporation and as an indirect subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the magicJack Merger Agreement, customary closing conditions were satisfied, and the acquisition was completed on November 14, 2018. Subject to the terms and conditions of the magicJack Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of magicJack converted into the right to receive $8.71 in cash without interest, representing approximately $143.1 million in aggregate merger consideration.
 
Acquisition of Wunderlich
 
On May 17, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Wunderlich Merger Agreement”) with Wunderlich. Pursuant to the Wunderlich Merger Agreement, customary closing conditions were satisfied and the acquisition was completed on July 3, 2017. The total consideration of $65.1 million paid to Wunderlich shareholders in connection with the Wunderlich acquisition was comprised of (a) cash in the amount of $29.7 million; (b) 1,974,812 newly issued shares of our common stock at closing which were valued at $31.5 million for accounting purposes determined based on the closing market price of our shares of common stock on the acquisition date on July 3, 2017, less a 13.0% discount for lack of marketability as the shares issued are subject to certain escrow provisions and restrictions that limit their trade or transfer; and (c) 821,816 newly issued common stock warrants with an estimated fair value of $3.9 million. The common stock and common stock warrants issued includes 387,365 common shares and 167,352 common stock warrants that are held in escrow and subject to forfeiture to indemnify us for certain representations and warranties in connection with the acquisition. We believe that the acquisition of Wunderlich will allow us to benefit from wealth management, investment banking, corporate finance, and sales and trading services provided by Wunderlich. The acquisition of Wunderlich is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. We also entered into a registration rights agreement with certain shareholders of Wunderlich (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) on July 3, 2017 for the shares issued in connection with the Wunderlich Merger Agreement. The Registration Rights Agreement provides the Wunderlich shareholders with the right to notice of and, subject to certain conditions, the right to register shares of our common stock in certain future registered offerings of shares of our common stock. In June 2018, Wunderlich changed its name to B. Riley Wealth Management, Inc.
 
Acquisition of FBR

The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $73.5 million in a stock transaction through the issuance of 4,831,633 shares of our common stock. Upon completion of the acquisition, we integrated and merged the investment banking operations of BRC with and into FBR and changed the name of FBR to B. Riley FBR.
