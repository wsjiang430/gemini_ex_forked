Item 1. Business 
General
Owens & Minor, Inc. and subsidiaries (we, us, our or the Company), a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a global healthcare solutions company that incorporates product manufacturing, distribution support and innovative technology services to deliver significant and sustained value across the breadth of the industry – from acute care to patients in their home. Our business has two distinct segments: Products & Healthcare Services and Patient Direct. Products & Healthcare Services provides distribution, outsourced logistics and value-added services, and manufactures and sources medical surgical products through our production and kitting operations. Patient Direct expands our business along the continuum of care through delivery of disposable medical supplies sold directly to patients and home health agencies and is a leading provider of integrated home healthcare equipment and related services in the United States (U.S.). Our teammates serve healthcare industry customers in approximately 70 countries, by providing quality products and helping to reduce total costs across the healthcare supply chain by optimizing point-of care performance, freeing up capital and clinical resources and managing contracts to optimize financial performance. The description of our business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data included in this Form 10-K. 
 Founded in 1882, Owens & Minor was incorporated in 1926 and has operated continuously from its Richmond, Virginia headquarters. Through organic growth and acquisitions over many years, we significantly expanded and strengthened our company, achieving international scale in the healthcare market. Today, we have distribution, production, storage, customer service and sales facilities located across Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America and the United States.
Acquisition of Apria
On March 29, 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Apria, Inc. (Apria) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 7, 2022 (Apria Acquisition), in exchange for approximately $1.7 billion, net of $144 million of cash acquired. See Note 3, “Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further information.
Products & Healthcare Services
In our Products & Healthcare Services segment, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to healthcare providers and manufacturers. This segment is vertically-integrated, starting with America's-based manufacturing, using our proprietary technology, teammates, and leased or owned production facilities. We manufacture from raw material all the way to finished goods before transferring product to our distribution center network. Our portfolio of medical and surgical supplies includes branded products purchased from manufacturers and our own proprietary products. We store our products at our distribution centers and provide delivery of these products, along with related services, to healthcare providers around the U.S.
Our service offerings to healthcare providers include supplier management, analytics, inventory management, and clinical supply management. These value-add services help providers improve their processes for contracting with vendors, purchasing supplies and streamlining inventory. These services include our operating room-focused inventory management program that helps healthcare providers manage suture and endo-mechanical inventory, as well as our customizable surgical supply service that includes the kitting and delivery of surgical supplies in procedure-based totes to coincide with the healthcare providers' surgical schedule. 
In addition to services to healthcare providers, we offer a variety of programs dedicated to providing outsourced logistics and marketing solutions to our suppliers as well. These are designed to help manufacturers drive sales growth, increase market share and achieve operational efficiencies. Manufacturer programs are generally negotiated on an annual basis and provide for enhanced levels of support that are aligned with the manufacturer’s annual objectives and growth goals. We have contractual arrangements with manufacturers participating in these programs that provide performance-based incentives to us, as well as cash discounts for prompt payment. Program incentives can be earned on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
We operate a network of 54 distribution centers located throughout the United States, which are strategically located to efficiently serve our provider and manufacturer customers. Investments in information technology support our business including warehouse management systems, customer service and ordering functions, demand forecasting programs, electronic commerce, data warehousing, decision support and supply chain management. 
We customize product deliveries, whether the orders are “just-in-time,” “low-unit-of-measure,” pallets, or truckloads. We also customize delivery schedules according to customers’ needs to increase their efficiency in receiving and storing products. We use low-unit-of-measure automated picking modules in our larger distribution centers to maximize efficiency, and our distribution center teammates use voice-pick technology to enhance speed and accuracy in performing certain warehousing processes. We partner with a third party company to deliver most supplies in the United States. We also use contract carriers and parcel delivery services when they are more cost-effective and timely.
The majority of our distribution arrangements compensate us on a cost-plus percentage basis, under which a negotiated percentage mark-up is added to the contract cost of the product agreed to by the supplier and customer or Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). We price our services for other arrangements under activity-based pricing models. In these cases, pricing depends upon the type, level and/or complexity of services that we provide to customers, and in some cases we do not take title to the product (although we maintain certain custodial risks). As a result, this fee-for-service pricing model aligns the fees we charge with the cost of the services provided, which is a component of distribution, selling and administrative expenses, rather than with the cost of the product, which is a component of cost of goods sold.
Our Products & Healthcare Services segment manufactures and sources medical surgical products through our production and kitting operations. We provide medical supplies and solutions for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections across the acute and alternate site channels. 
Our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Thailand, Honduras, Mexico and Ireland. Our business has recognized brands across its portfolio of product offerings, including sterilization wrap, surgical drapes and gowns, facial protection, protective apparel, medical exam gloves, custom and minor procedure kits and other medical products. We use a wide variety of raw materials and other inputs in our production processes, with polypropylene polymers and nitrile constituting our most significant raw material purchases. We base our purchasing decisions on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. Global commodity prices can affect pricing of certain raw materials on which we rely. In our Halyard product line, polypropylene polymers, which are oil based, and nitrile represent a significant component of our manufacturing costs. In addition, the prices of other raw materials we use, such as resins and finishing supplies, often fluctuate in response to changes in oil prices. 
We support customer sales through a dedicated global sales force and direct our primary sales and marketing efforts toward hospitals and other healthcare providers to highlight the unique benefits and competitive differentiation of our products. We work directly with physicians, nurses, professional societies, hospital administrators and GPOs to collaborate and educate on emerging practices and clinical techniques that prevent infection and speed recovery. These marketing programs are delivered directly to healthcare providers. Additionally, we provide marketing programs to our strategic distribution partners throughout the world. For the products we manufacture, we operate four major distribution centers located in North America and Asia that ship finished products to customers, as well as other distribution sites that also have customer shipping capabilities, in order to optimize cost and customer service requirements. 
Our proprietary products are typically purchased pursuant to purchase orders or supply agreements in which the purchaser specifies whether such products are to be supplied through a distributor or directly. These products may be sold on an intercompany basis within our Products & Healthcare Services segment when we are the designated distributor, to other third-party distributors or directly to healthcare providers.
Patient Direct 
Our Patient Direct segment expands our business along the continuum of care through delivery of disposable medical supplies sold directly to patients and home health agencies and is a leading provider of integrated home healthcare equipment and related services in the United States. The segment offers a comprehensive range of products and services for in-home care and delivery across diabetes treatment, home respiratory therapy (including home oxygen and non-invasive ventilation services), and obstructive sleep apnea treatment (including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure devices, and patient support services). Additionally, Patient Direct supplies a wide range of other home medical equipment, patient care product lines including ostomy, wound care (including negative pressure wound therapy), urology, incontinence and other products and services to help improve the quality of life for patients with home care needs. Revenues are generated through fee-for-service and capitation arrangements with large government and commercial payors (Payors) for equipment, supplies, services and other items rented or sold to patients. We provide patients with a variety of clinical and administrative support services and related products and supplies, most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan. Patient Direct remains focused on being the industry’s highest-quality provider of home healthcare equipment, medical supplies and related services, while maintaining a commitment to being a low-cost operator. We aim to provide a compelling value proposition to patients, providers and Payors by allowing patients to receive necessary care and services in the comfort of their own home, while, at the same time, reducing the costs of treatment. 
Patient Direct has a nationwide sales force, focusing on managed care and key referral sources, six centers of excellence aligned with specific mail order product categories and a nationwide network to optimize shipping distance and time, with over 300 locations to serve patients. 
Our Customers 
Through Products & Healthcare Services we currently provide products and services to thousands of healthcare provider customers either directly or indirectly through third-party distributors. Through Patient Direct, we provide delivery of disposable medical supplies and equipment sold or rented directly to patients and home health agencies, for which payments are received from managed care plans, the U.S. federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, private insurers, home health agencies, and directly from patients. Medicare contracts within our Patient Direct segment may be subject to a Competitive Bidding Process (CBP) for the durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS), as further described in the Regulation section.
Our customers include multi-facility networks of healthcare providers offering a broad spectrum of healthcare services to a particular market or markets as well as smaller, independent hospitals. In addition to contracting directly with healthcare providers at the Integrated Delivery Network (IDN) level, we also contract with GPOs as well as other types of healthcare providers including surgery centers, physicians’ practices and smaller networks of hospitals that have joined together to negotiate terms. We have contracts to provide distribution services to the members of a number of national GPOs, including Vizient, Premier, Inc. (Premier) and HealthTrust Purchasing Group (HPG). Below is a summary of these agreements: 
GPO | Year of Renewal or Extension | Term | Sales to Members as a % of Consolidated Net Revenue in 2022
Vizient | 2021 | 2 years | 35% 
Premier | 2021 | 5 years | 19% 
HPG | 2022 | 4 years | 12% 

We have our own independent relationships with most of our hospital customers through separate contractual commitments that may or may not be based upon the terms of our agreement with the GPO. As a result, the termination or expiration of an agreement with a particular GPO would not necessarily mean that we would lose the members of such GPO as our customers. 
Our suppliers represent the largest and most influential healthcare manufacturers in the industry. We have long-term relationships with these important companies in the healthcare supply chain and have long provided traditional distribution services to them. No sales of products from any individual suppliers exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenue for 2022. 
Asset Management
In our business, a significant investment in inventory and accounts receivable is required to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers and provide high-quality service. As a result, efficient asset management is essential to our profitability. We continually work to refine our processes to optimize inventory and collect accounts receivable. 
Inventory 
We actively monitor inventory for obsolescence and use inventory days and other operational metrics to measure our performance in managing inventory. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these assessments. We are focused in our efforts to optimize inventory and continually consolidate products and collaborate with suppliers on inventory productivity initiatives. When we convert large-scale IDN customers to our distribution network, an additional investment in inventory in advance of expected sales is generally required. 
Accounts Receivable 
In the normal course of business, we provide credit to our customers and use credit management techniques to evaluate customers’ creditworthiness and facilitate collection. In our Products & Healthcare Services segment, these techniques may include performing initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers based primarily on financial information provided by them and from sources available to the general public. We also use third-party information from sources such as credit reporting agencies, banks and other credit references. For Patient Direct, we have developed internal expertise to manage the unique reimbursement requirements of certain Payors and continue to negotiate simplifications in the claims submission process in an effort to reduce subsequent denials and shorten related collection periods. Our policy is to collect co-payments from the patient or applicable secondary Payor. In the absence of a secondary Payor, we generally require the co-payment to be paid at the time the patient is initially established.
We actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk, days sales outstanding (DSO) and accounts receivable carrying costs. Our ability to accurately invoice and ship product to customers enhances our collection results and affects our DSO performance. As we diversify our customer portfolio, the change in business mix also affects our DSO. We have arrangements with certain customers under which they make deposits on account, because they do not meet our standards for creditworthiness, to reduce past due balances, or in order to obtain more favorable pricing. 
Competition
 The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Products & Healthcare Services competitors include two major nationwide manufacturers who also provide distribution services, Cardinal Health, Inc. and Medline Industries, Inc. We also compete against other product manufacturers, including Hogy Medical, Multigate Medical Products, Mölnlycke Health Care and the HARTMANN Group. In addition, we compete with a number of regional and local distributors, and customer self-distribution models. Major outsourced logistics competitors serving healthcare manufacturers in the United States include United Parcel Service and FedEx Corporation. In our Patient Direct segment, we compete against national providers that deliver products and services to patients' homes, including AdaptHealth Corp., Lincare, Rotech, Aerocare, Inogen, Inspire Medical Systems, Inc., Viemed Healthcare, Inc., as well as regional providers and local organizations. In addition, pharmacy benefit managers, such as CVS Health Corporation, are beginning to compete with us in the home healthcare market.
 In the United States, several of our distribution partners and GPOs directly compete with us by sourcing their own brands. We compete against reusable products, or low usage of infection prevention products, due in large part to limited awareness and education on infection prevention practices and products. The highly competitive environment requires us to seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively. Our products face competition from other brands that may be less expensive than our products and from other companies that may have more resources than we do. Competitive factors include price, alternative clinical practices, innovation, quality and reputation. To successfully compete, we must demonstrate that our products offer higher quality, more innovative features or better value versus other products.
Research and Development
We continuously engage in research and development to commercialize new products and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of our existing products. In our Products & Healthcare Services segment, we are focused on maintaining and improving our market position by providing innovative customer-preferred product enhancements, with a particular focus on the operating room. Leveraging customer insights and our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities, we seek to continuously improve our product designs, specifications and features to deliver cost efficiencies while improving healthcare worker and patient protection. We continuously refresh our surgical drape and gown portfolio to ensure that our products are aligned with the latest medical and procedural standards. Our research team works with healthcare providers to develop and design exam glove and apparel portfolios that optimize comfort and fit and provide cost-effective infection prevention solutions for use throughout the hospital. We are also investing in new categories and solutions that complement our technical expertise and existing intellectual property. We are particularly focused on those new categories that we believe will leverage our existing scalable technology platforms as well as our sales and marketing expertise.
Intellectual Property
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to the growth of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position.
On a regular basis, we review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property owned by others.
We have approximately 825 patents and patent applications pending in the United States and other countries that relate to the technology used in many of our products. We utilize patents in our surgical and infection protection products and currently have approximately 135 issued patents in the U.S. and approximately 540 issued patents in countries outside the U.S. These patents generally expire between 2023 and 2043. We do not license any patents from third parties that are material to our business.
We also file patent applications for innovative product lines and solutions that result from our technical expertise. In order to protect our ongoing research & development investments, we have approximately 40 pending patent applications in the U.S. and approximately 110 pending patent applications in countries outside of the U.S.
With respect to trademarks, we have approximately 1,180 trademarks and trademark applications pending in the United States and other countries that are used to designate or identify our company or products. We have approximately 160 U.S. registration trademarks and approximately 850 registered trademarks outside of the U.S. We also have approximately 60 pending trademark applications in the U.S. and approximately 110 pending trademark applications outside of the U.S.
We manufacture and distribute products bearing the well-known “Halyard” brand. Other well-known registered trademarks we use include: Aero Blue, Apria, Byram Healthcare, Quick Check, Smart-Fold, Orange, One Step, Purple, Purple Nitrile, Purple Nitrile-Xtra, Lavender, Sterling, and Safeskin.
We consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products, as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark.
Regulation
The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of products, as well as the provision of logistics and services in the healthcare industry and provisions of our contracts with certain governmental agencies, are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments and agencies. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects our business. Among other effects, healthcare regulation substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approvals to market newly developed and existing products. We believe we are in material compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations. Notwithstanding this, violations of these laws and regulations may still occur, which could subject us to civil and criminal enforcement actions; licensure revocation, suspension, or non-renewal; severe fines and penalties; the repayment of amounts previously paid to us; and even the termination of our ability to provide services under certain government programs.
Healthcare is an area of rapid regulatory change. Changes in the laws and regulations and new interpretations of or guidelines relating to existing laws and regulations may affect permissible activities and compliance requirements, licenses and approvals required to be held, the relative costs associated with doing business, and reimbursement amounts paid by federal, state and other third-party payors. We cannot predict the future of federal, state, local and foreign regulation or legislation, or possible changes in national healthcare policies. Future legislative and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
General Regulation
Privacy
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of Protected Health Information (PHI). HIPAA includes a number of requirements pertaining to the privacy and security of certain PHI, as well as the standard formatting of certain electronic health transactions. As part of the provision of, and billing for, healthcare equipment and services, our Patient Direct business is required to collect and maintain PHI and as such, are subject to HIPAA as a covered entity. HIPAA also applies to business associates of covered entities, which are individuals and entities that provide services for or on behalf of those covered entities. Failure of our business associates to comply with HIPAA requirements can adversely impact our business. Numerous other federal and state laws that protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PHI and healthcare related data also apply to us. In many cases, these laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, the HIPAA and HITECH rules and requirements, and may be subject to varying interpretation by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expenses, adverse publicity and liability. We are also subject to privacy laws outside the United States. See “Products & Healthcare Services-Global Privacy Regulation.”
Further, federal and state consumer laws are being applied increasingly by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state enforcement authorities, to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal information or PHI, and to ensure that businesses and organizations maintaining personal information about individuals implement appropriate data safeguards. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to direct the use of their personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may result in data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for PHI and HIPAA regulated entities, and the CCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are continuing to develop and remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In November 2020, Californians approved the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA), which modified and expanded the CCPA and established a new California Privacy Protection Agency. The CPRA established January 1, 2023 as the new compliance date for most of the other substantive provisions of the CPRA. Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia have enacted similar laws to provide for the protection of consumer privacy, and numerous other states have similar laws under consideration. 
Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of PHI and other personal information. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security, and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we 
handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. If we publish information that is considered untrue, it may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Furthermore, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. 
New health information standards implemented on the federal and state level could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle personal and healthcare-related data and communicate with payors, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. Failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations (including the interpretations thereto) related to patient health information could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions. 
Licensing
Certain of our businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the licensure of our facilities, healthcare specialists working for or engaged by us, and certain medical products, and requirements vary amongst jurisdictions. 
Certain of our teammates in our Patient Direct segment are authorized and/or licensed under various federal, state and local requirements, which cover a variety of topics including standards regarding the provision of medical or care services, clinical records, infection control and care plans. Additionally, certain states may require certain of our teammates to complete training programs, undergo background checks, and maintain state certification. In addition, various federal and state authorities and clinical practice boards regulate the licensure of our clinical specialists, working either directly as employees or on a per diem or contractual basis, and facilities. We believe we are currently licensed appropriately as required by the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate in all material respects, but additional licensing requirements may be imposed upon us in existing or future markets. 
In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution and post-market surveillance. We must also comply with laws and regulations governing operations, storage, transportation, manufacturing, sales, safety and security standards for each of our manufacturing and distribution centers. This includes oversight by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and state boards of pharmacy, or similar state licensing boards and regulatory agencies. For example, our locations that fill and distribute medical oxygen containers must register with the FDA as a medical gas manufacturer, and these registered locations are subject to extensive regulation. Among other requirements, the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations impose certain quality control, documentation and recordkeeping requirements on the receipt, processing and distribution of medical gas. Further, in each state in which we operate medical gas facilities, we are subject to regulation under varying state health and safety laws. The FDA and state authorities conduct periodic, unannounced inspections at our facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs and other regulations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to a variety of administrative or legal sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. We expend significant resources to achieve compliance with federal and state law requirements at each of our facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be successful and that our facilities will achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal, state and local law requirements. We are also subject to certain federal and state disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry. 
Environmental Laws
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to hazardous materials, pollution and the protection of the environment. Such regulations include those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, including medical waste, remediation of contaminated sites and protection of worker health and safety. These laws and regulations frequently change and have become increasingly stringent over time. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant fines or penalties or limitations on our operations or claims for remediation costs, as well as alleged personal injury or property damages. We believe our current operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and that we maintain all material permits required to operate our business.
Certain environmental laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability for investigation and remediation of the release of regulated substances into the environment. Such liability can be imposed on current or former owners or operators of contaminated sites, or on persons who dispose or arrange for disposal of wastes at a contaminated site. Based on available information, we do not believe that any known compliance obligations, releases or 
investigations under environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, there can be no guarantee that these releases or newly- discovered information, more stringent enforcement of or changes in environmental requirements, or our inability to enforce available indemnification agreements will not result in significant costs.
In addition, governments in the U.S. and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose substantial costs on us. Until the timing and extent of climate-related laws are clarified, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations.
Antitrust Laws
The federal government, most states and foreign governments have enacted antitrust or competition laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, certain acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare sector is currently a priority of the FTC and the Department of Justice (DOJ). In addition, the DOJ has been pursuing criminal antitrust enforcement actions for conduct of parties that the DOJ is alleging to be fixing wages or limiting worker mobility. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.
Products & Healthcare Services
Global Operations
Our operations are subject to local, country and regional regulations, such as those promulgated by the European Medicines Agency and the Medical Devices Directive. In addition, quality requirements are imposed by customers which audit our operations on a regular basis. Each of our manufacturing locations is licensed or registered with the appropriate local authority. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, as well as prevailing industry best practices, in the conduct of our business operations outside of the United States.
Since we market our products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action.
Our operations are impacted by trade regulations in many countries that govern the import of raw materials and finished products, as well as data privacy laws that require safeguards for the protection of healthcare and other personal data. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace as well as laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States.
Global Privacy Regulation
Our international operations are impacted by data privacy laws that require safeguards for the protection of healthcare and other personal data. Data protection laws and regulations are evolving globally and may continue to add additional compliance costs and legal risks to our international operations. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) imposes a comprehensive data protection regime with the potential for regulatory fines as well as data breach litigation by impacted data subjects. Under the EU GDPR, regulatory penalties may be passed by data protection authorities for up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or €20 million. The United Kingdom has implemented similar legislation (the UK GDPR) that may carry similar compliance and operational costs, and potential fines, as the EU GDPR. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the EU GDPR, UK GDPR and other international data protection laws may impact our operations outside the U.S. and may limit the ways in which we can provide services or use personal data collected while providing services.
Anti-bribery and Corruption
In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. These regimes have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. A violation of the FCPA or other similar laws by us and/or our agents or representatives could result in, among other things, the imposition of fines and penalties, changes to our business 
practices, the termination of or other adverse impacts under our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts, and/or harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price.
Patient Direct 
Reimbursement
To participate in and qualify for reimbursement under governmental reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, we must comply with extensive conditions of participation imposed by federal and state authorities as well as third-parties administering such governmental reimbursement programs. If we were to violate the applicable regulations or requirements governing participation, we could be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and be subject to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
Demand for many of the existing and new medical devices and supplies dispensed to our customers is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse us and our customers for their members/beneficiaries’ medical expenses in the jurisdictions where we do business. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels. From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business, and the federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing reimbursement levels for medical expenses paid for in whole or in part with government funds. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), each contain provisions that have directly impacted reimbursement for the products we provide. Reimbursement from private third-party payors varies and is dependent on contract negotiations and there is no guarantee that such contracts will be profitable, and failure to comply with these contracts may result in termination or financial liabilities. Efforts by Payors to reduce healthcare costs have intensified in recent years and will likely continue, which may result in reductions or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by healthcare companies. It is possible that healthcare companies will continue to experience a shift in Payor mix away from fee-for-service Payors, resulting in an increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to reimbursement based upon value-based principles and quality-driven managed care programs, and general industry trends that include pressures to control healthcare costs. Pressures to control healthcare costs and a shift away from traditional health insurance reimbursement to payments based upon quality outcomes have increased the uncertainty of payments.
The ACA affects how healthcare services are delivered and reimbursed through the expansion of health insurance coverage, constraining Medicare and Medicaid program spending, and establishing programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. Potential changes to the ACA may impact our business including but not limited to court challenges, and administration and legislative modifications. Lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals and reduced government funding for programs could each cause our revenues to decrease to the extent such legislation reduces reimbursement rates.
The MMA established a Competitive Bidding Process (CBP) for certain durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS) we provide. The DMEPOS CBP impacts the Medicare reimbursement amounts for suppliers of certain DMEPOS items, and in the past, included some DMEPOS items that we provide to our patients. Cumulatively, in previous competition rounds of the DMEPOS CBP in effect between 2011 and 2018, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the product categories for which we submitted bids. Competitive bidding contracts are expected to be re-bid at least every three years. While we cannot predict the outcome of the DMEPOS CBP on our business in the future nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years, the program may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
State Medicaid programs implement reimbursement policies for the products and services we provide which can vary from state to state. We cannot predict whether states may consider adopting reimbursement reductions or whether any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
There are various federal and state laws that regulate the operation of healthcare providers, including those that prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers, suppliers, and parties that contract with such providers and suppliers who participate in, receive payments from or are in a position to make or influence referrals in connection with government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Of particular importance, each of which may be amended and updated from time to time, are:
•The federal Anti-Kickback statute and similar state equivalents prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal healthcare program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $112,131 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act (FCA). Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;
•The federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to healthcare entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have ownership interests or other financial arrangements, if these entities provide certain designated health services (including home healthcare services) reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $27,750 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $185,009 for a circumvention scheme;
•The federal FCA and similar state laws provide, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved.. Among the many other potential bases for liability is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. The federal government has taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. The FCA may be enforced directly by the federal government or by a whistleblower on the government’s behalf;
•The Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act, which imposes criminal liability on individuals or entities that pay, receive, or solicit any remuneration in return for patient referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, or laboratories; 
•The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;
•Similar state law provisions pertaining to Anti-Kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party Payor, including commercial insurers or services paid out-of-pocket by patients; and
•Federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered.
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) have continued their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. An example of the continued prioritization by DOJ on corporate and healthcare matters is evidenced by the September 2022 release of the Monaco Guidelines, which reflect enhancements to long-standing DOJ Guidelines on corporate accountability. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on operations. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $12,537 to $25,076 per false claim or statement, with such penalty amounts being updated from time to time, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. 
Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
We completed our acquisition of Apria on March 29, 2022. On December 18, 2020, a federal judge approved a civil and administrative settlement between Apria and the United States and certain state Medicaid programs, in a complaint filed by three relators under the qui tam provisions of the FCA, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq., as well as comparable state false claims laws, in connection with the rental of non-invasive ventilation products (NIVs). Apria also entered into separate settlements to resolve the relators’ claims brought on behalf of the states of California and Illinois related to NIVs covered by private insurers.
To resolve any potential liability regarding alleged improper use of NIVs, Apria agreed to enter a civil settlement agreement and to pay $40 million to the federal government and the states. Apria also agreed with the California Department of Insurance to pay $500,000 to resolve claims asserted by the relators under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, Cal. Ins. Code § 1871 et seq. Apria separately agreed with the relators to settle all remaining claims from their complaint, including: (1) claims for retaliation in violation of federal and state laws; (2) claims for attorneys’ fees and costs available under federal and state law; and (3) claims under the Illinois Insurance Claims Fraud Prevention Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 92/1 et seq. Apria did not admit that any of its conduct was illegal or otherwise improper.
As part of the settlement, Apria also entered into a five-year CIA with the HHS OIG. The CIA requires Apria to maintain its ongoing corporate compliance program and implement a set of defined corporate integrity activities for a period of five years from the effective date of the CIA. Among other things, the CIA requires Apria to impose certain oversight obligations on our board of directors; provide certain management certifications; continue or implement, as applicable, certain compliance training and education; and engage an Independent Review Organization to perform certain reviews. The CIA also includes certain reporting, certification, record retention, and notification requirements. In the event of a breach of the CIA, Apria could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Federal and state agencies and health insurance carriers often conduct audits and request customer records and other documents to support claims submitted for payment of services rendered to customers. In response to an audit or inquiry, we are obligated to procure and submit the underlying medical records retained by various clinical providers, medical facilities and prescribers, which may be challenging. If a determination is made that our records or the patients’ medical records are insufficient to meet requirements for the claims, we could be subject to denials or overpayment demands for claims submitted for Medicare reimbursement. In the rare event that such an audit results in major discrepancies of claims records which lacked medical necessity, we may be subject to broader corrective measures, including extrapolation of audit results across a wider population of claims, submission of recoupment demands for claims other than those examined in the audit, or placing the provider on a full pre-payment review.
Marketing and Transparency Reporting Laws
Communications with consumers are also subject to laws and regulations governing communications, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), the Federal CAN-SPAM Act, additional fax regulations under the Junk Fax Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Medicare regulations. Under such regulations, companies are restricted in the methods used to contact consumers by email, telephone, and text message, for example, through the use of random or sequential “auto-dialer” devices. Numerous class-action suits under federal and state laws have been filed in recent years against companies that conduct SMS texting programs, with many resulting in multi-million-dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the federal regulations we are subject to, as well as state equivalents where applicable. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of consumer phone calls, emails and text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability, could be required to change some portions of our business model, could face negative publicity and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable statutes in many states. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a third-party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts. Requirements under state collection agency statutes vary, with most requiring compliance similar to that required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable state statutes where applicable. If our collection practices are viewed as inconsistent with these standards, we may be subject to damages and penalties.
Human Capital Resources
Teammate Overview
Our teammates are at the heart of everything that we do. Through their creativity, talent and hard work, our teammates allow us to offer exceptional products and services, and they provide the force that propels our mission to empower our customers to advance healthcare. Thus, we are committed to maintaining a culture and providing benefits that will attract and retain top talent. We are also committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment that allows our teammates to perform at a high level, emphasizes a culture of safety and is conducive to professional and personal growth. 
At the end of 2022, we employed approximately 13,400 full-time and part-time teammates in the U.S. and 9,100 teammates outside of the U.S (OUS). None of our domestic teammates are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), but certain OUS teammates are represented and covered by labor agreements. Throughout our operations, we continue to have positive relationships with our teammates, as well as the unions and works councils that represent our OUS teammates.
We depend on our key personnel to successfully operate our business, including our executive officers, senior corporate management and management at our operating segments. We seek to attract and retain top talent for these critical roles by offering competitive base and incentive compensation packages (and in certain instances share-based compensation and retention incentives), attractive benefits, and opportunities for advancement and rewarding careers. We periodically review and adjust, if needed, our teammates’ total compensation (including salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, other cash and equity incentives, and benefits) to ensure that our offerings are competitive within the industry and consistent with our performance. We have also implemented enterprise-wide talent development and succession planning programs designed to identify future and/or replacement candidates for key positions. In addition to compensation, we promote numerous charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs that not only support the communities we serve, but also provide experiences for teammates to promote a collaborative and rewarding work environment.
In order to take advantage of available opportunities and successfully implement our long-term strategy, we understand that we must be able to employ, train and retain skilled personnel. To that end, we support and utilize various training and educational initiatives, and we have developed Company-wide and project-specific teammate training and educational programs. Key programs focus on teammate safety, leadership development, health and wellness, work-life balance, talent management, diversity and inclusion, and teammate engagement. We believe that diversity, inclusion, and teammate engagement are integral to our vision, strategy and business success. We pride ourselves on sustaining a culture that respects teammates and values concern for others. We believe that fostering an environment that values diversity, inclusion and ethical conduct creates an organization that is able to embrace, leverage and respect differences among our teammates, customers and the communities where we live, work and serve. As a result, we created Teammate Resource Groups (TRGs) that provide resources and support for underrepresented identity groups to improve innovation, promote belonging, increase team alignment, and boost engagement. Our current TRGs include Black Heritage, Outreach, Mentorship and Enrichment, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Rising to Excellence, Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Achievement, LGBTQ+, Military and Veteran, Women Empowerment Network, and Women in Technology. We also believe that our teammates are the face of Owens & Minor, and we expect every teammate to model our values and commitment to ethical business practices as set forth in our Code of Honor. 
In 2021, we established the Owens & Minor Foundation, which is dedicated to further our commitment towards impactful contributions to charitable and civic organizations in the communities we serve. The Owens & Minor Foundation focuses on three primary areas, the environment, healthcare, and diversity and inclusion.
We believe that our efforts to create an environment that is conducive to our values and teammate success have been rewarded. Our values reflect our commitment to our customers and our teammates, as well as the environment and the communities where we live and work. Our values embody “IDEAL” behavior — Integrity, Development, Excellence, Accountability and Listening. All teammates are expected to reflect these values in all they do each and every day. We also hold our teammates to a high standard of performance, and we regularly evaluate teammates’ productivity against current requirements, future demand expectations and historical trends. From time to time, we may add, reduce or adjust resources in certain areas to align with changing circumstances.
Teammate Benefits
We believe teammate benefits are an essential component of a competitive total compensation package. Our benefits programs are designed to attract and retain top talent, and include medical, health and dental insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death and disability insurance, life insurance, travel and accident insurance, and our 401(k) savings and retirement plans.
Our Board of Directors’ Role in Human Capital Resource Management
Our Board of Directors (Board) believes that human capital management, and particularly the ability to attract, retain and develop key talent, is essential to our continued growth and success. Our Board also believes that effective human capital management is vital to maintaining a culture that reflects our core values and our shared commitment to excellence and ethical business practices.
Management regularly reports to the Our People & Culture Committee of the Board on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, teammate development, compensation, and benefits. From time to time, we also conduct teammate engagement surveys to solicit feedback, and report findings from these surveys to the Board. The Our People & Culture Committee has oversight of talent retention and development, including succession planning, and the Board provides input on important decisions in each of these areas. 
COVID-19 Response
In response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we implemented health and safety protocols to protect our teammates and customers. These protocols meet or exceed health and safety standards required by federal, state and local government agencies, and are based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, as well as, other public health authorities. Actions taken to protect our teammates and customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include:
•Providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to teammates in distribution and manufacturing locations;
•Monitoring CDC community levels and taking actions to mitigate risks during high community level surges;
•Providing paid time off for teammates to receive COVID-19 vaccinations;
•Significantly increasing remote work arrangements and virtual interactions among teammates and with customers;
For additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – We are subject to risks related to public health crises or future outbreaks of health crises or other adverse public health developments such as the COVID-19 global pandemic.”
