ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
HEI Consolidated
HEI and subsidiaries and lines of business.  HEI is a holding company with its subsidiaries principally engaged in electric utility, banking, and non-regulated renewable/sustainable infrastructure businesses operating in the State of Hawaii. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s sources of funds are dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries, borrowings, and sales of equity. The rights of HEI and its creditors and shareholders to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of HEI’s subsidiaries are subject to the prior claims of the creditors and preferred shareholders of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of HEI in its capacity as a creditor are recognized as primary. The abilities of certain of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI are subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions (see Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). HEI is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii and has three reportable segments—Electric utility, Bank, and Other.
Electric Utility.  Hawaiian Electric and its operating utility subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (Hawaii Electric Light) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (Maui Electric), are regulated electric public utilities that provide essential electric service to approximately 95% of Hawaii’s population through the operation of five separate grids that serve communities on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai. See also “Electric utility” section below. 
Bank.  ASB is one of the largest financial institutions in the State of Hawaii (based on total assets), with assets totaling approximately $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. ASB provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to Hawaii consumers and businesses. See also “Bank” section below.
Other. The “Other” segment is composed of HEI’s corporate-level operating, general and administrative expenses and the results of Pacific Current, LLC (Pacific Current). Pacific Current was formed in September 2017 to focus on investing in non-regulated clean energy and sustainable infrastructure in the State of Hawaii to help reach the state’s sustainability goals. See also “Electric utility—Hawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs” section below and Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Pacific Current activities. The “Other” segment also includes ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii) (a holding company), which owns ASB.
Additional information.  For additional information about HEI, see HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company’s website address is www.hei.com, where annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports (last 10 years) are made available free of charge in the Investor Relations section as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC (and available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov). The information on the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K unless, and except to the extent, specifically incorporated herein by reference. HEI and Hawaiian Electric intend to continue to use HEI’s website as a means of disclosing additional information. Accordingly, investors should routinely monitor such portions of HEI’s website, in addition to following HEI’s, Hawaiian Electric’s and ASB’s press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. Investors may also wish to refer to the PUC website at dms.puc.hawaii.gov/dms in order to review documents filed with and issued by the PUC. No information at the PUC website is incorporated herein by reference, and the Company has no control over its accuracy or completeness.
Regulation.  HEI and Hawaiian Electric are each holding companies within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and implementing regulations, which requires holding companies and their subsidiaries to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) access to books and records relating to FERC’s jurisdictional rates. FERC granted HEI and Hawaiian Electric a waiver from its record retention, accounting and reporting requirements, effective May 2006.
HEI is subject to an agreement entered into with the PUC (the PUC Agreement) which, among other things, requires PUC approval of any change in control of HEI. The PUC Agreement also requires HEI to provide the PUC with periodic financial information and other reports concerning intercompany transactions and other matters. It also prohibits the electric utilities from loaning funds to HEI or its nonutility subsidiaries and from redeeming common stock of the electric utility subsidiaries without PUC approval. Further, the PUC could limit the ability of the electric utility subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock. See also Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Electric utility—Regulation” below. 
In October 2021, Pacific Current requested informal guidance from the PUC regarding application of the affiliate transaction requirements (ATRs) to certain investments. In response, in January 2022, the PUC issued guidance (Order No. 38186, Docket No. 2018-0065) providing that, if Pacific Current acquires or invests in an unaffiliated entity that has been awarded a power purchase agreement with the Utilities through the Stage 1 or 2 Request for proposals (RFPs), such entity 
would become an “Affiliate” or “Affiliate-Related Entity” under the ATRs, and any wholesale power transactions between the entity and the Utilities, including under the awarded power purchase agreement, would require PUC review and approval. Such a requirement may impact Pacific Current’s competitiveness in acquiring and investing in new utility-scale projects in the Utilities’ service territory and thereby impact the pace and extent of Pacific Current’s growth. As a result of the D&O, Pacific Current intends to focus its future growth activities on projects not subject to a power purchase agreement with the Utilities or projects outside of the Utilities’ service territory. 
HEI and ASB Hawaii are subject to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulation, supervision and reporting requirements as savings and loan holding companies. As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, supervision and regulation of HEI and ASB Hawaii, as thrift holding companies, moved to the FRB, and supervision and regulation of ASB, as a federally chartered savings bank, moved to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July 2011. In the event the OCC has reasonable cause to believe that any activity of HEI or ASB Hawaii constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of ASB, the OCC is authorized to impose certain restrictions on HEI, ASB Hawaii and/or any of their subsidiaries. Possible restrictions include precluding or limiting: (i) the payment of dividends by ASB; (ii) transactions between ASB, HEI or ASB Hawaii, and their subsidiaries or affiliates; and (iii) any activities of ASB that might expose ASB to the liabilities of HEI and/or ASB Hawaii and their other affiliates. See also Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (Gramm Act) permitted banks, insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other, thereby allowing “one-stop shopping” for an array of financial services. Although the Gramm Act further restricted the creation of so-called “unitary savings and loan holding companies” (i.e., companies such as HEI whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries), the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among HEI, ASB Hawaii and ASB is “grandfathered” under the Gramm Act so that HEI and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as ASB maintains its qualified thrift lender (QTL) status test discussed under “Bank—Regulation—Qualified thrift lender test.” ASB met the QTL test at all times during 2022; however, the failure of ASB to satisfy the QTL test in the future could result in a need for HEI to divest ASB. Under the Gramm Act, any proposed sale of ASB would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of ASB would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as, or capable of qualifying as, either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company, or as one of the authorized financial holding companies permitted under the Gramm Act. 
HEI is also affected by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to corporate governance and executive compensation, including provisions requiring shareholder “say on pay” and “say on pay frequency” votes, mandating additional disclosures concerning executive compensation and compensation consultants and advisors and further restricting proxy voting by brokers in the absence of instructions. See “Bank—Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A for a discussion of effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on HEI and ASB.
Environmental regulation.  HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state statutes and governmental regulations pertaining to water quality, air quality and other environmental factors. See the “Environmental regulation” discussions in the “Electric utility” and “Bank” sections below, and Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Human Capital Resources. 
Employees.  The Company had total and full-time employees as follows:

*The increase in employees from 2021 is related to Pacific Current’s acquisition of a closed-loop biomass plant in 2022.
The employees of HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, other than the electric utilities, are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260 represents roughly half of the Utilities’ workforce covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 31, 2024.
Diversity & inclusion.  Diversity and inclusion are essential to the continued success of the Company. The Company values 
gender, religious beliefs, race, marital status, ethnicity, parental status, age, education, physical and mental ability, income, sexual orientation, occupation, language, geographic location, and many more components, and believes that an inclusive and collaborative culture produces excellent performance and innovation and helps guide the Company’s decision-making and its 
ability to meet its customers’ and community’s needs. Additionally, because the Company’s businesses operate exclusively in Hawaii, which is one of the most racially diverse states in the U.S., the Company believes it is important that its workforce reflects this diversity. The diversity information that follows is based on total employees, including employees on long-term leave, part-time employees and temporary employees.

leaders. Offerings are delivered in online, instructor-led, and on-the-job learning formats. ASB’s focus on meaningful growth and development opportunities positions the Bank to recruit and retain top talent. 
Safety and health.  As a key priority, the Company strives to create workplace environments where employees feel physically and emotionally safe. For the Utility, safety is of paramount importance due to the inherent risks involved in certain aspects of its operations and the critical importance to the State of Hawaii of maintaining the electrical grid. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has continued to modify its operations and policies to align with guidance from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the State of Hawaii Department of Health (DOH). The Company also monitors the rates of infection within the state and makes adjustments, accordingly, to limit the risk of transmission in the workplace and ensure the health of the Company’s employees.
Hawaiian Electric. Hawaiian Electric is committed to maintaining a strong safety culture. Due to the nature of its operations, safety is of paramount importance. Management strives to provide visible leadership and strategic direction for the health and safety management system and programs in their area of responsibility. This leadership and direction help to build and maintain a strong safety culture and drive safety improvement, allocates adequate resources to enable implementation of safety programs and holds leaders accountable for the implementation of safety programs and resulting health and safety performance. Executive compensation is tied to achievement of quantified severity and total case incident rate targets (TCIR). These targets reward improvements in workplace safety, promote employee well-being, and help reduce expenses over time. Hawaiian Electric promotes a safety culture that aims for zero incidents through all employees taking ownership of safety for themselves, their co-workers, contractors, and the public. More information on such targets is available in HEI’s annual proxy statement. Hawaiian Electric also provides a variety of programs and benefits that support employee physical, financial and emotional well-being. These programs include access to fitness and yoga classes, online corporate wellness activities and education, gym and group fitness discounts, and financial well-being classes.

Its power plant is situated on approximately 59 acres and the remaining 34 acres includes surrounding parcels of which 30 acres are located on the ocean front. Kaʻieʻie Waho Company, LLC (Kaʻieʻie Waho), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, owns a 6-MW solar photovoltaic facility located on approximately 20 acres on the 
southern coast of the island of Kauai. Mahipapa, LLC (Mahipapa), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, owns a 7.5- MW biomass facility located on approximately 65 acres of land and leases 3,500 acres on the island of Kauai.
Electric utility
Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries and service areas.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric (Utilities) are regulated operating electric public utilities engaged in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity on the islands of Oahu; Hawaii; and Maui, Lanai and Molokai, respectively. 
    In 2022, the electric utilities’ revenues and net income amounted to approximately 91% and 78% respectively, of HEI’s consolidated revenues and net income, compared to approximately 89% and 72% in 2021 and approximately 88% and 86% in 2020, respectively. 
The islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai have a combined population estimated at 1.4 million, or approximately 95% of the total population of the State of Hawaii, and comprise a service area of 5,815 square miles. The principal communities served include Honolulu (on Oahu), Hilo and Kona (on Hawaii) and Wailuku and Kahului (on Maui). The service areas also include numerous suburban communities, resorts, U.S. Armed Forces installations and agricultural operations. In November 2020, the PUC approved Hawaiian Electric’s acquisition of the electric distribution systems serving 12 U.S. Army installations on Oahu, including Schofield Barracks, Wheeler Army Airfield, Tripler Army Medical Center, Fort Shafter and Army housing areas. 
The state has granted Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric nonexclusive franchises, which authorize the Utilities to construct, operate and maintain facilities over and under public streets and sidewalks. Each of these franchises will continue in effect for an indefinite period of time until forfeited, altered, amended or repealed.
Climate change action plan. The Utilities have set an aggressive goal to cut carbon emissions from power generation 70% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. The emissions covered by this goal include stack emissions from generation owned by Hawaiian Electric and independent power producers (IPPs) who sell electricity to the Utilities. In addition, the Utilities have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2045 or sooner. These commitments are aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommendation of no more than 1.5°C average global warming to avoid potentially devastating climate events.
Key elements of the 2030 plan to reduce emissions include:
•    The closing of the state’s last coal plant, which occurred in September 2022 upon expiry of the PPA
•    Adding nearly 50,000 rooftop solar systems, more than a 50% increase, compared to the approximately 90,000 systems online in 2021 when the Climate Change action plan was developed
•    Retiring at least six fossil-fueled generating units and significantly reducing the use of others as new renewable resources come online
•    Adding additional renewable energy projects capable of generating a total of at least 1 gigawatt beyond resources in place in 2021, including shared solar (community-based renewable energy)
•    Using more grid-scale and customer-owned energy storage
•    Expanding geothermal resources
•    Creating innovative programs that provide customers incentives for using clean, lower-cost energy at certain times of the day and using less fossil-fueled energy at night
By 2030, Hawaiian Electric’s renewable portfolio standard is expected to exceed 70%, with renewable resources available to provide close to 100% of the electricity generated on Hawaii Island and in Maui County. Achieving the 70% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 is highly dependent on the successful completion of renewable IPP projects under Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other RFPs.
After 2030, progress on elimination of carbon from power generation assumes continued use of proven resources, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, biofuels and energy storage, along with the development of new technologies. Those technologies may include offshore wind, green hydrogen, wave energy and carbon-capture—all currently under development around the world—as well as other solutions that will emerge. A diverse portfolio of resources will also enhance resilience to climate-related events.

Regulatory mechanisms. Base electric rates are set in rate cases, and on April 29, 2020, the PUC issued an order terminating the mandatory triennial rate case cycle in anticipation of the performance-based regulation framework (PBR Framework). The regulatory framework in effect in 2020 included a number of mechanisms designed to provide utility financial stability during the transition toward the state’s 100% renewable energy goals. For example, under the sales decoupling mechanism, the Utilities are allowed to recover from customers, target test year revenues, independent of the level of kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales. The decoupling mechanism (i.e., the Revenue Balancing Account) continues under the PBR Framework.
On December 23, 2020, the PUC issued a D&O in Phase 2 of the PBR proceeding, establishing the PBR Framework for the Utilities. The PBR Framework includes, among other matters, a five-year multi-year rate plan with an index-driven annual revenue adjustment (ARA), which replaces the RAM, modification of the MPIR mechanism (renamed Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM)) to include deferred and operation and maintenance (O&M) expense projects and to permit the Utilities to include the full amount of approved costs in the EPRM for recovery in the first year the project goes into service, pro-rated for the portion of the year the project is in service, and continuation of (i) the revenue balancing account, (ii) the pension and other postretirement benefit tracking mechanisms, and (iii) energy cost recovery clause, purchased power adjustment clause, and other recovery mechanisms. See “Commitments and contingencies-Regulatory proceedings-Performance-based regulation framework” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
A summary of these regulatory mechanisms, most of which have been either maintained, modified, or approved under PBR as noted, is as follows:

Mechanism | Description | PBR Framework (effective June 2021) 
Sales decoupling | Provides predictable revenue stream by fixing net revenues at the level approved in last rate case (revenues not linked to kWh sales). | Maintained under PBR. 
Annual Revenue Adjustment (ARA) | Annually adjusts revenue levels during a Multi-Year Rate Period, determined by formula which includes an inflation factor, a predetermined productivity adjustment (currently set at zero), adjustments for exceptional circumstances not in the Utilities’ control and a customer dividend. | Replaced the Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) effective June 1, 2021. The transition to the ARA includes the continuation of the 2020 RAM revenue adjustment. 
Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM) | Reduces regulatory lag and permits recovery of revenues for net costs of approved eligible projects placed in service during the Multi-Year Rate Period through the revenue balancing account (RBA) that is not provided for by other effective tariffs, the ARA, Performance Incentive Mechanism (PIMS) or Shared Savings Mechanisms (SSMs). | Formerly known as the Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism. The EPRM was modified to include recovery of both capital and O&M expenses and to permit the Utilities to include the full amount of approved costs for recovery in the first year that projects are placed into service, pro-rated for the portion of the year that projects are in service. 
Energy cost recovery clause (ECRC) and purchased power adjustment clause (PPAC) | Allows for timely recovery of fuel and purchased power costs to reduce earnings volatility. Symmetrical fossil fuel cost risk-sharing (98% customer/2% utility) mechanism established for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric capped at $2.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million annually, respectively. | Maintained under PBR. 
Performance incentive mechanism (PIM) / Shared Savings Mechanism (SSM) | Annually adjusts revenue to recover from or credit customers for specific areas of the Utilities’ performance measured against the PUC’s approved targets. | Maintained under PBR with a portfolio of SSMs and new PIMs added to encourage acceleration in renewables, grid services, interconnection of DERs, low-to-moderate income energy efficiency, advanced metering infrastructure, generation-based reliability (penalties only), interconnection of utility scale renewable projects, and cost control of non-ARA costs and allows for financial rewards for exemplary performance.
Pension and other post-employment benefit trackers | Allow tracking of pension and other post-employment benefit costs and contributions above or below the cost included in rates in a separate regulatory asset/liability account. | Maintained under PBR. 
Renewable energy infrastructure program | Permits recovery of renewable energy infrastructure projects through a surcharge. | Maintained under PBR. 
Expedited Pilot Process | Fosters innovation by establishing an expedited implementation process for pilots that test new technologies, programs, business models and other arrangements. Proposed pilots are subject to PUC approval with a total annual cap of $10 million. | Approved under PBR to allow for timely cost recovery of annual expenditures of approved pilot projects through an adjustment to target revenues. 
Earnings Sharing Mechanism (ESM) | Protects the Utilities and customers from excessive earnings or losses, as measured by the Utilities’ achieved rate making ROACE. | Maintained under PBR, adjusted to reflect a symmetrical ESM for achieved rate making ROACE outside of a 300 basis points dead band above or below the current authorized ROACE of 9.5% for each of the Utilities. 

Seasonality.  kWh sales of the Utilities follow a seasonal pattern, but they do not experience extreme seasonal variations experienced by some electric utilities on the U.S. mainland. In Hawaii, kWh sales tend to increase in the warmer, more humid months as a result of increased demand for air conditioning, and with cloudy and rainy weather due to lower production by privately owned customer photovoltaic (PV) systems. In 2022, kWh sales increased compared to the prior year due to the easing of remaining pandemic related restrictions and increased domestic travel to Hawaii, which in turn increased the demand for electricity.
Significant customers.  The Utilities derived approximately 12%, 11% and 11% of their operating revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively from the sale of electricity to various federal government agencies. Hawaiian Electric continues to work with various federal agencies to implement measures that will help them achieve their energy efficiency, resilience and clean energy objectives.

1.In July 2022, Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), which amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. 
2 Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) with 34.6 MW of firm capacity went offline due to lava flow on Hawaii Island since May 2018, but returned to service with firm capacity of 13 MW in the first quarter of 2021 and ramped up to 25.7 MW in the second quarter of 2022 and continued to provide 25.7 MW for the remainder of 2022.

Hawaiian Electric units at normal ratings; Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric units at reserve ratings.
Nonutility generators - Hawaiian Electric: 208 MW (Kalaeloa Partners, L.P., oil-fired) and 68.5 MW (HPOWER, refuse-fired); Hawaii Electric Light: 60 MW (Hamakua Energy, oil-fired). Hawaii Electric Light also has a firm capacity PPA with PGV for 34.6 MW that went offline due to lava flow on Hawaii Island since May 2018, but returned to service with firm capacity of 13 MW in the first quarter of 2021 and ramped up to 25.7 MW in the second quarter of 2022. PGV’s capability of 25.7 MW has been incorporated into the utility’s firm contract power capability as of December 31, 2022.
Noncoincident and nonintegrated.
Generating reliability and reserve margin.  Hawaiian Electric serves the island of Oahu and Hawaii Electric Light serves the island of Hawaii. Maui Electric has three separate electrical systems—one each on the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric have isolated electrical systems that are not currently interconnected to each other or to any other electrical grid and, thus, each maintains a higher level of reserve generation and cost structure than is typically carried by interconnected mainland U.S. utilities, which are able to share reserve capacity. These higher levels of reserve margins are required to meet peak electric demands, to provide for scheduled maintenance of generating units (including the units operated by IPPs relied upon for firm capacity) and to allow for the forced outage of the largest generating unit in the system.
Nonutility generation.  The Utilities have supported state and federal energy policies which encourage the development of renewable energy sources that reduce the use of fuel oil as well as the development of qualifying facilities. The Utilities’ renewable energy sources and potential sources range from wind, solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, wave and hydroelectric power to energy produced by municipal waste and other biofuels.
The rate schedules of the electric utilities contain ECRCs and PPACs that allow them to recover costs of fuel and purchase power expenses. 
In addition to the firm capacity PPAs described below, the electric utilities also purchase energy on an as-available basis directly from nonutility generators and through its Feed-In Tariff programs, as well as through a new renewable dispatchable generation power purchase agreement. The electric utilities also receive renewable energy from customers under its Net Energy Metering and Customer Grid Supply programs.
The PUC has allowed rate recovery for the firm capacity and purchased energy costs for the electric utilities’ approved firm capacity and as-available energy PPAs.
Hawaiian Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaiian Electric currently has two major PPAs that provide a total of 276.5 MW of firm capacity, representing 18% of Hawaiian Electric’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Oahu as of December 31, 2022.
Under a 1988 PPA, as amended, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 208 MW of firm capacity from Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. (Kalaeloa). The Kalaeloa facility, which is a Qualifying Facility (QF), is a combined-cycle operation, consisting of two oil-fired combustion turbines burning low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines. The PPA term ended on May 23, 2016 and was extended while the parties were in negotiations for a new agreement. The parties executed an Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement (ARPPA) on October 29, 2021, which among other provisions extends the term for ten contract years after the effective date. The ARPPA was approved on November 23, 2022. The parties executed a letter agreement to establish that the rates under the ARPPA became effective on January 1, 2023.
Hawaiian Electric also entered into a PPA in March 1986 and a firm capacity amendment in April 1991 with the City and County of Honolulu with respect to a refuse-fired plant (HPOWER). Under the PPA, as amended and restated, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 68.5 MW of firm capacity annually up until the PPA expires on April 2, 2033.
Hawaiian Electric formerly entered into a PPA with AES Hawaii, Inc. (AES Hawaii), a Hawaii-based, indirect subsidiary of The AES Corporation. The PPA, under which AES Hawaii provided 180 MW of firm capacity from its coal-fired cogeneration plant, expired on September 1, 2022 and was not renewed. The shutdown of the AES Hawaii coal plant represents the end of coal use for power generation in Hawaii. See “Commitments and contingencies–Power purchase agreements–AES Hawaii, Inc.” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update regarding this PPA.
Hawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaii Electric Light has two major PPAs that provide a total of 85.7 MW of firm capacity, representing 32% of Hawaii Electric Light’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Hawaii as of December 31, 2022.
In October 1997, Hawaii Electric Light entered into an agreement with Encogen, which was succeeded by Hamakua Energy Partners, L. P. (HEP). The agreement requires Hawaii Electric Light to purchase up to 60 MW (net) of firm capacity for a period of 30 years, expiring on December 31, 2030. The dual-train combined-cycle facility consists of two oil-fired combustion turbines and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines, which primarily burns naphtha (a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons) and, starting in late 2019, biodiesel (comprising approximately 21% of HEP’s fuel mix in 2022). In November 2017, Hamakua Energy, an indirect subsidiary of HEI, purchased the plant from HEP. 
Hawaii Electric Light has a 35-year PPA, as amended, with Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) for 34.6 MW of firm capacity from its geothermal steam facility, which will expire on December 31, 2027. However, the PGV facility went offline in May 2018 due to lava flow on Hawaii Island. In March 2019, Hawaii Electric Light entered into a Rebuild Agreement with PGV, which sets forth the parties’ respective responsibilities associated with restoration of the facility. The Rebuild Agreement shall govern the terms until PGV becomes fully operational. In December 2019, Hawaii Electric Light entered into an Amended and Restated PPA with PGV to, among other things, extend the term by 25 years to 2052 and expand the firm capacity capable of being delivered to 46 MW, subject to PUC approval. PGV returned to service at a level providing limited output without firm capacity in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is currently providing 25.7 MW of capacity. See “New renewable PPAs” in the “Developments in renewable energy efforts” section in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A. 
In May 2012, Hawaii Electric Light signed a PPA with Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC (Hu Honua) for 21.5 MW of renewable, dispatchable firm capacity fueled by locally grown biomass on the island of Hawaii. This PPA was approved by the PUC in December 2013, however, the approval was appealed. The Supreme Court of Hawaii issued a decision remanding the matter to the PUC for further proceedings. See “Commitments and contingencies–Power purchase agreements–Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update regarding this PPA. 
Maui Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Maui Electric has no firm capacity PPAs. 
Fuel oil usage and supply.  The rate schedules of the Utilities include ECRCs under which electric rates (and consequently the revenues of the electric utility subsidiaries generally) are adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. See discussion of rates and issues relating to the ECRC below under “Rates.”
Hawaiian Electric’s steam generating units consume LSFO and Hawaiian Electric’s combustion turbine peaking units consume diesel. Hawaiian Electric’s Schofield Generating Station consumes mostly B99 grade biodiesel, but is permitted to also burn ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD).
Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s steam generating units burn high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) and Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui combustion turbine generating units burn diesel. Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui, Molokai, and Lanai diesel engine generating units burn ULSD. 
See “Fuel contracts” in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A.
The following table sets forth the average cost of fuel oil used by Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric to generate electricity in 2022, 2021 and 2020: 

 | Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii Electric Light | | Maui Electric | Consolidated
 | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu | | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu | $/Barrel | | ¢/MBtu | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu
2022 | 144.63 | | 2,339.5 | | 131.36 | | 2,183.4 | | 135.39 | | 2,274.5 | 141.49 | 2,310.9
2021 | 79.10 | | 1,275.9 | | 80.52 | | 1,333.9 | | 83.45 | | 1,404.0 | 80.06 | 1,305.4
2020 | 62.06 | | 1,003.7 | | 63.21 | | 1,048.3 | | 66.81 | | 1,122.7 | 63.00 | 1,028.7

The average per-unit cost of fuel oil consumed to generate electricity for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric reflects a different volume mix of fuel types and grades as follows:

 | Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii Electric Light | | Maui Electric
 | % LSFO | % Biodiesel/Diesel | | % HSFO | % Diesel | % HSFO | | % Diesel
2022 | 93 | | 7 | | 36 | | 64 | | 24 | 76
2021 | 93 | | 7 | | 41 | | 59 | | 22 | 78
2020 | 94 | | 6 | | 39 | | 61 | | 24 | 76

The prices that Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light pay for purchased energy from certain older nonutility generators are generally linked to the price of oil. The AES Hawaii energy prices varied primarily with an inflation index. The energy prices for Kalaeloa, which purchases LSFO from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (PAR), vary primarily with the price of Asian crude oil. On December 31, 2019, Hawaii Electric Light and PGV entered into an Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement, which delinks the pricing for energy delivered from the facility from fossil fuel prices. Hamakua Energy’s energy prices vary primarily with the cost of naphtha.
The Utilities estimate that 75% of the net energy they generate will come from fossil fuel oil in 2023 compared to 67% in 2022. Hawaiian Electric generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to 47 days of forward consumption. Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric generally maintain an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to approximately one month’s supply of both HSFO and diesel. The PPA with Hamakua Energy requires that it maintains certain minimum fuel inventory levels.
Rates.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC with respect to rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other matters. See “Regulation” below.
General rate increases require the prior approval of the PUC after public and contested case hearings. Rates for Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries include ECRCs, and PPACs. Under current law and practices, specific and separate PUC approval is not required for each rate change pursuant to automatic rate adjustment clauses previously approved by the PUC. Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) requires the PUC to periodically review the adjustment clauses related to energy cost of electric and gas utilities in the state, and such clauses, as well as the rates charged by the utilities generally, are subject to change. PUC approval is also required for all surcharges and adjustments before they are reflected in rates.
See “Utility projects” under “Commitments and contingencies” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition.  See “Competition” in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A.
Regulation.  The PUC regulates the rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other aspects of the operations of Hawaiian Electric and its electric utility subsidiaries. See the previous discussion under “Rates”.
On September 15, 2014, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of Energy executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) recognizing that Hawaii is embarking on the next phase of its clean energy future. The MOU provides the framework for a comprehensive, sustained effort to better realize its vast renewable energy potential and allow Hawaii to push forward in three main areas: the power sector, transportation and energy efficiency. This next phase is focused on stimulating deployment of clean energy infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, energy system innovation and test bed investments.
Energy efficiency. The PUC issued an order on January 3, 2012 approving a framework for Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards (EEPS) that set 2008 as the initial base year for evaluation and linearly allocated the 2030 goal to interim incremental reduction goals of 1,375 GWH by 2015 and 975 GWH by each of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030. Pursuant to the PUC’s EEPS framework, the PUC has contracted with a public benefits fee administrator to operate and manage energy efficiency programs, and any incentive and/or penalty mechanisms applicable solely to the public benefit fee administrator and related to the achievement of the goals are at the discretion of the PUC. 
The Division of Consumer Advocacy’s 2021 Compliance Resolution Fund Report states that Hawaii continues to progress towards its 2030 Renewable Portfolio Standards and EEPS goals. The EEPS has contributed to lower kWh sales; however, the implementation of sales decoupling has delinked sales and revenues. See “Regulatory mechanisms” above. 
Electrification of Transportation. In June 2018, the PUC initiated a proceeding to review the Utilities’ Electrification of Transportation (EoT) Strategic Roadmap, which provided an economic analysis for light duty electric vehicles on the island of Oahu, Maui and Hawaii. In July 2019 the Utilities filed a study analyzing data regarding the critical backbone for electric vehicle charging needs in their service territories. In October 2019, the Utilities filed their EoT Workplan, establishing a schedule to continue implementation of the EoT roadmap with a focus on EV rate design and make-ready charging infrastructure in the near-term. The Utilities followed through on the EoT Workplan in 2020, with three filings: the electric bus make ready infrastructure pilot, Charge Ready Hawaii commercial infrastructure pilot, and two commercial EV rates, EV-J and EV-P. The electric bus make ready infrastructure pilot, EV-J and EV-P, and Charge Ready Hawaii commercial infrastructure pilot were approved by the PUC on May 7, 2021, December 30, 2021 and January 24, 2022, respectively, and launched in the first and fourth quarters of 2022. In August 2020, the Utilities committed to electrifying 100% of its class 1 vehicles (sedans, SUVs and light trucks) by 2035. The Utilities operate 30 public DC fast chargers (DCFC) as part of the EV-U pilot and EV-MAUI tariff. They filed a request in the fourth quarter of 2021 to expand and make permanent the public charging pilot with an additional 150 DCFCs and 150 level 2 charging stations at 75 locations. This request will be ready for decision making in the first quarter of 2023.
Renewable Portfolio Standards. In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045, respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS since 2014 (only electrical generation using renewable energy as a source counts). In July 2022, Governor Ige signed Act 240 (H.B.2089), that amended the RPS calculation from renewable energy as a percentage of sales to renewable energy as a percentage of total generation. The amended RPS calculation results in a lower calculated percentage than the amount calculated under the previous methodology. For example, the 2022 RPS achieved under the revised RPS calculation would have been 39.1% under the prior method versus 31.8% under the revised method. The change in the definition is to be applied prospectively to future milestone measurements and will require that the Utilities acquire more renewable energy than under the previous RPS calculation to comply with the RPS milestones; however, the Utilities expect to continue to meet the RPS milestones under the amended RPS law to exceed the 2030 RPS requirement of 40%.
Affiliate transactions. Certain transactions between HEI’s electric public utility subsidiaries (Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric) and HEI and affiliated interests (as defined by statute) are subject to regulation by the PUC. 
In December 1996, the PUC issued an order in a docket to review the relationship between HEI and Hawaiian Electric and the effects of that relationship on the operations of Hawaiian Electric. The order required Hawaiian Electric to continue to provide the PUC with periodic status reports on its compliance with the PUC Agreement (pursuant to which HEI became the holding company of Hawaiian Electric). Hawaiian Electric files such status reports annually. In the order, the PUC also required the Utilities to present a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the holding company structure and investments in nonutility subsidiaries have on a case-by-case basis on the cost of capital to each utility in future rate cases and remove any such effects from the cost of capital. The Utilities have made presentations in their subsequent rate cases to support their positions that there was no evidence that would modify the PUC’s finding that Hawaiian Electric’s access to capital did not suffer as a result of HEI’s involvement in nonutility activities and that HEI’s diversification did not permanently raise or lower the cost of capital incorporated into the rates paid by Hawaiian Electric’s utility customers.
In December 2018, the PUC established a set of requirements governing transactions and sharing of information between the Utilities and its affiliates (Affiliate Transaction Requirements, ATRs), which was subsequently modified and clarified in January 2019 following the Utilities’ motion for reconsideration. The PUC stated the intent of the ATRs is to establish safeguards to avoid potential market power benefits and cross-subsidization between regulated and unregulated activities. The requirements include rules on interactions with affiliates, information handling, business development, political activities, promotional activities, sales of products and services, and employee sharing restrictions. The ATRs include implementing an internal code of conduct, a compliance plan, including policies and procedures to comply with the requirements, and having an audit conducted every three years that examines the compliance with the requirements. Penalties for non-compliance depend on the severity of the violation, and can range from daily fines to divestiture of the Utilities by the holding company. On January 26, 2023, the PUC approved the Utilities’ internal code of conduct. The PUC also directed the Utilities to make language changes to parts of the Utilities’ 2023 Compliance Plan. On February 6, 2023, the Utilities filed a motion for clarification and/or reconsideration of the PUC’s order which instructed a change to the definition of “Affiliate” as used in the 2023 Affiliate Transaction Requirements Compliance Plan.
Other regulations. The Utilities are not subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act, except under Sections 210 through 212 (added by Title II of PURPA and amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992), which permit the FERC to order electric utilities to interconnect with qualifying cogenerators and small power producers, and to wheel power to other electric utilities. Title I of PURPA, which relates to retail regulatory policies for electric utilities, and Title VII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which addresses transmission access, also apply to the Utilities. The Utilities are also required to file various operational reports with the FERC.
Because they are located in the State of Hawaii, Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries are exempt by statute from limitations set forth in the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 on the use of petroleum as a primary energy source.
Regulatory Developments. See “Regulatory proceedings” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussions.
See also “HEI–Regulation” above.
Environmental regulation.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, like other utilities, are subject to periodic inspections by federal, state and, in some cases, local environmental regulatory agencies, including agencies responsible for the regulation of water quality, air quality, hazardous and other waste and hazardous materials. These inspections may result in the identification of items needing corrective or other action. Except as otherwise disclosed in this report (see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, and Notes 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), the Utilities believe that each subsidiary has appropriately responded to environmental conditions requiring action and that, as a result of such actions, such environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Utilities.
Water quality controls.  The generating stations, substations and other utility facilities operate under federal and state water quality regulations and permits, including, but not limited to, the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (governing point source discharges, including wastewater and storm water discharges) and the Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control (regulating disposal of wastewater into the subsurface).
Oil pollution controls.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes programs that govern actual or threatened oil releases and imposes strict liability on responsible parties for clean-up costs and damages to natural resources and property. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations under OPA require certain facilities that use or store oil to prepare and implement Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans in order to prevent releases of oil to navigable waters of the U.S. Certain facilities are also required to prepare and implement Facility Response Plans (FRPs) to ensure prompt and proper response to releases of oil. The utility facilities that are subject to SPCC Plan and FRP requirements have prepared and implemented SPCC Plans and FRPs.
Air quality controls.  The Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes permitting programs to reduce air pollution. The CAA amendments of 1990, established the federal Title V Operating Permit Program (in Hawaii known as the Covered Source Permit program) to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state air pollution control requirements. The 1977 CAA Amendments established the New Source Review (NSR) permitting program, which affect new or modified generating units by requiring a permit to construct under the CAA and the controls necessary to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
Title V operating permits have been issued for all of the Utilities’ affected generating units.
Hazardous waste and toxic substances controls.  The operations of the electric utility are subject to EPA regulations that implement provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, also known as Superfund), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
RCRA underground storage tank (UST) regulations require all facilities that use USTs for storing petroleum products to comply with established leak detection, spill prevention, standards for tank design and retrofits, financial assurance, operator training, and tank decommissioning and closure requirements. All of the Utilities’ USTs currently meet the applicable requirements.
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act under SARA Title III requires the Utilities to report potentially hazardous chemicals present in their facilities in order to provide the public with information so that emergency procedures can be established to protect the public in the event of hazardous chemical releases. Since January 1, 1998, the steam electric industry category has been subject to Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements.
The TSCA regulations specify procedures for the handling and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a compound found in some transformer and capacitor dielectric fluids. The TSCA regulations also apply to responses to releases of PCBs to the environment. The Utilities have instituted procedures to monitor compliance with these regulations and have implemented a 
program to identify and replace PCB transformers and capacitors in their systems. On October 22, 2021, the EPA published its proposed rule entitled “Alternate PCB Extraction Methods and Amendments to PCB Cleanup and Disposal Regulations” in the Federal Register. The EPA is proposing to expand options for the methods used to characterize and verify the cleanup of PCBs, and amend the performance-based disposal option along with other amendments to improve the implementation of the regulations, clarify ambiguity, and correct technical errors. The EPA comments period closed on January 20, 2022.
Hawaii’s Environmental Response Law (ERL), as amended, governs releases of hazardous substances, including oil, to the environment in areas within the state’s jurisdiction. Responsible parties under the ERL are jointly, severally, and strictly liable for a release of a hazardous substance. Responsible parties include owners or operators of a facility where a hazardous substance is located and any person who at the time of disposal of the hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substance was disposed.
The Utilities periodically discover leaking oil-containing equipment such as USTs, piping, and transformers. Each subsidiary reports releases from such equipment when and as required by applicable law and addresses the releases in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Bank
General.  ASB is one of the largest financial institutions headquartered in the State of Hawaii with assets of $9.5 billion and deposits of $8.2 billion, as of December 31, 2022. ASB is a full-service community bank that serves both consumer and commercial customers and operates 38 branches on the islands of Oahu (27), Maui (5), Hawaii (3), Kauai (2), and Molokai (1) as of December 31 2022. Subsequently, ASB closed two additional branches on the island of Oahu to reduce the total branch count to 36 branches as of February 2023.
In 2022, ASB’s revenues and net income amounted to approximately 9% and 33% of HEI’s consolidated revenues and net income, respectively, compared to approximately 11% and 41% in 2021 and approximately 12% and 29% in 2020.
At the time of HEI’s acquisition of ASB, HEI agreed with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), Department of Treasury’s predecessor regulatory agency, that ASB’s regulatory capital would be maintained at a level of at least 6% of ASB’s total liabilities, or at such greater amount as may be required from time to time by regulation. Under the agreement, HEI’s obligation to contribute additional capital to ensure that ASB would have the capital level required by the OTS was limited to a maximum aggregate amount of approximately $65.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, as a result of certain HEI contributions of capital to ASB over the years, HEI’s maximum obligation under the agreement to contribute additional capital has been reduced to approximately $28.3 million. ASB is subject to OCC regulations on dividends and other distributions and ASB must receive a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC’s and FRB’s non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI. In addition to OCC oversight, federal law and Federal Reserve Board policy require that HEI, as a savings and loan holding company, serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for any FDIC-insured depository institution that it controls. Accordingly, if ASB were to be in financial distress or to otherwise be viewed by the regulators as in unsatisfactory condition, HEI could be required to provide additional capital or liquidity support or take other action, in support of ASB.
Lending activities. See Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the composition of ASB’s loan portfolio.
Origination, purchase and sale of loans.  Generally, residential and commercial real estate loans originated by ASB are collateralized by real estate located in Hawaii. For additional information, including information concerning the geographic distribution of ASB’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio and the geographic concentration of credit risk, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The demand for loans is primarily dependent on the Hawaii real estate market, business conditions, interest rates and loan refinancing activity.
Residential mortgage lending.  ASB originates fixed rate and adjustable rate loans secured by single family residential property, including investor-owned properties, with maturities of up to 30 years. ASB’s general policy is to require private mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio of the property exceeds 80% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination. For non-owner-occupied residential property purchases, the loan-to-value ratio typically may not exceed 75% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination.
Construction and development lending.  ASB provides fixed rate loans for the construction of one-to-four unit residential and commercial properties. Construction loan projects are typically short term in nature. Construction and development financing generally involves a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Accordingly, construction and development loans are generally priced higher than loans collateralized by completed structures. ASB’s underwriting, monitoring and disbursement practices with respect to construction and development financing are designed to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete construction projects. See “Bank—Loan portfolio risk elements” in HEI’s MD&A and “Multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending” below.
Multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending.  ASB provides permanent financing and construction and development financing collateralized by multifamily residential properties (including apartment buildings) and collateralized by commercial and industrial properties (including office buildings, shopping centers and warehouses) for its own portfolio as well as for participation with other lenders. Commercial real estate lending typically involves long lead times to originate and fund. As a result, production results can vary significantly from period to period.
Consumer lending.  ASB offers a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loans. Loans collateralized by deposits are limited to 90% of the available account balance. ASB offers home equity lines of credit, clean energy loans, secured and unsecured VISA cards (through a third party issuer), checking account overdraft protection and other general purpose consumer loans.
Commercial lending.  ASB provides both secured and unsecured commercial loans to business entities. This lending activity is designed to diversify ASB’s asset structure, shorten maturities, improve rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio and attract commercial checking deposits. ASB offers commercial loans with terms generally up to ten years.
Loan origination fee and servicing income.  In addition to interest earned on residential mortgage loans, ASB receives income from servicing loans, for late payments and from other related services. Servicing fees are received on loans originated and subsequently sold by ASB where ASB acts as collection agent on behalf of third-party purchasers.
ASB charges the borrower at loan settlement a loan origination fee. See “Loans” in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deposits and sources of funds. Deposits continue to be the largest source of funds for ASB for use in lending, meeting liquidity requirements and making investments, and are affected by market interest rates, competition and management’s responses to these factors. In 2020 and 2021 deposits had increased in part due to PPP loan proceeds and consumer economic impact payments from the CARES Act stimulus program. In 2022, with the rising interest rate environment and inflationary 
pressures in the economy, there was an outflow of core deposits. Retention and sustained growth of these low-cost deposit types will be challenging in the current environment. ASB borrows on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in deposit flows. ASB may borrow on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending or investment activities. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be additional sources of funds, but they are a higher cost funding source than deposits.
Competition.  The banking industry in Hawaii is highly competitive. At December 31, 2022, there were 7 financial institutions insured by the FDIC headquartered in the State of Hawaii. While ASB is one of the largest financial institutions in Hawaii, based on total assets, ASB faces vigorous competition for deposits and loans from two larger banking institutions based in Hawaii and from smaller institutions that heavily promote their services in niche areas, such as providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as national financial services organizations. Competition for loans and deposits comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives. ASB faces additional competition in seeking deposit funds from various types of corporate and government borrowers, including insurance companies. Competition for origination of mortgage loans comes primarily from mortgage banking and brokerage firms, commercial banks, other savings institutions, insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. These entities may have a physical presence in the State of Hawaii or operate from out of state and provide online services. See also “Bank—Executive overview and strategy” in HEI’s MD&A.
To remain competitive and continue building core franchise value, ASB continues to develop and introduce new products and services to meet the needs of its consumer and commercial customers. Additionally, the banking industry is constantly changing and ASB is making the investment in its people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive. 
The primary factors in ASB’s competition for mortgage and other loans are the competitive interest rates and loan origination fees it charges, the wide variety of loan programs it offers and the quality and efficiency of the services it provides to borrowers and the business community. ASB believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges, the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community.
The primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates, the quality and range of services offered, marketing, convenience of locations, hours of operation, availability and functionality of other non-branch channels such as online and mobile banking and perceptions of the institution’s financial soundness and safety. To compete effectively, ASB offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch, convenient automated teller machines and other banking options including online and mobile banking platforms. ASB also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns.
ASB has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single-family home mortgages to higher-spread, shorter-duration consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans. The origination of consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans. For example, the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for residential mortgage loans. These different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for credit losses established by ASB for its consumer, commercial and commercial real estate loans. 
Regulation.  ASB, a federally chartered saving bank, is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Department of Treasury, OCC and the FDIC, and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of ASB’s capital and the results of periodic “safety and soundness” examinations conducted by the OCC. In addition, ASB’s holding companies are subject to the regulatory supervision of the FRB. See “HEI Consolidated–Regulation” above.
See “Bank—Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A for the final capital rules under the Basel III regulatory capital framework.
Examinations.  ASB is subject to periodic “safety and soundness” examinations and other examinations by the OCC. In conducting its examinations, the OCC utilizes the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System adopted by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which system utilizes the “CAMELS” criteria for rating financial institutions. The six components in the rating system are: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to market risk. The OCC examines and rates each CAMELS component. An overall CAMELS rating is also given, after taking into account all of the component ratings. A financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a “memorandum of understanding” or a “cease and desist” order following an examination if its CAMELS rating is not satisfactory. An institution is prohibited from disclosing the OCC’s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall CAMELS rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer, director, employee, attorney or auditor, except as provided by regulation. The OCC also regularly 
examines ASB’s information technology practices and its performance under Community Reinvestment Act measurement criteria.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards. Pursuant to this Act, federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of ASB and its holding companies (e.g., standards for safety and soundness, real estate lending, accounting and reporting, transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders).
Deposit insurance coverage.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, govern insurance coverage of deposit accounts. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. Generally, the amount of all deposits held by a depositor in the same capacity (even if held in separate accounts) is aggregated for purposes of applying the insurance limit.
See “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of FDIC deposit insurance assessment rates.
Recent legislation and issuances.  See “Bank–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Affiliate transactions.  Significant restrictions apply to certain transactions between ASB and its affiliates, including HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For example, ASB is prohibited from making any loan or other extension of credit to an entity affiliated with ASB unless the affiliate is engaged exclusively in activities which the FRB has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies. There are also various other restrictions which apply to certain transactions between ASB and certain executive officers, directors and insiders of ASB. ASB is also barred from making a purchase of or any investment in securities issued by an affiliate, other than with respect to shares of a subsidiary of ASB.
Financial derivatives and interest rate risk.  ASB is subject to OCC rules relating to derivatives activities, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments. See “Derivative financial instruments” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments used by ASB. Currently ASB does not use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, but may do so in the future. Generally speaking, the OCC rules permit financial institutions to engage in transactions involving financial derivatives to the extent these transactions are otherwise authorized under applicable law and are safe and sound. The rules require ASB to have certain internal procedures for handling financial derivative transactions, including involvement of the ASB Board of Directors.
Management believes ASB’s interest rate risk processes are aligned with the Interagency Advisory on Interest Rate Risk Management and appropriate with earnings and capital levels, balance sheet complexity, business model and risk tolerance.
Liquidity.  OCC regulations require ASB to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. ASB’s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits, borrowings, the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities and the sale of loans into secondary market channels. ASB’s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker/dealers. ASB is approved by the FHLB of Des Moines to borrow an amount of up to 45% of assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB of Des Moines stock. As of December 31, 2022, ASB’s unused FHLB of Des Moines borrowing capacity was approximately $1.6 billion. ASB utilizes growth in deposits, advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits, repay maturing borrowings, fund existing and future loans and make investments. As of December 31, 2022, ASB had loan commitments, undisbursed loan funds and unused lines and letters of credit of $2.1 billion. Management believes ASB’s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels.
Supervision. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the FDICIA) establishes a statutory framework that is triggered by the capital level of a financial institution and subjects it to progressively more stringent restrictions and supervision as capital levels decline. The prompt corrective action capital requirements establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators. Declines in levels of capital, depending on their severity, will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences. Capital levels may decline for any number of reasons, including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations, deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned (typically acquired by foreclosure). The regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that ASB may make to HEI (through ASB Hawaii) and the requirement that ASB develop and implement a plan to restore its capital. The OCC rules implement the system of prompt corrective action. In particular, the rules define the relevant capital measures for the categories of “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” As of December 31, 2022, ASB was “well-capitalized.”
Interest rates.  FDIC regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are undercapitalized to offer interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions. As of December 31, 2022, ASB was “well capitalized” and thus not subject to these interest rate restrictions.
Qualified thrift lender test. ASB is a “qualified thrift lender” (QTL) under its federal thrift charter and, in order to maintain this status, ASB is required to maintain at least 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments,” measured on a monthly average basis in 9 out of the previous 12 months, which include housing-related loans (including mortgage-backed securities) as well as certain small business loans, education loans, loans made through credit card accounts and a basket (not exceeding 20% of total assets) of other consumer loans and other assets. Institutions that fail to maintain QTL status are subject to various penalties, including limitations on their activities. In ASB’s case, the activities of HEI, ASB Hawaii and HEI’s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions if ASB failed to maintain its QTL status, and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. As of December 31, 2022, and at all times during 2022, ASB was a qualified thrift lender.
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  ASB is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs, and ASB’s regional bank is the FHLB of Des Moines. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. Historically, the FHLBs have served as the central liquidity facilities for savings associations and sources of long-term funds for financing housing. At such time as an advance is made to ASB or renewed, it must be collateralized by collateral from one of the following categories: (1) fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property, or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; (2) securities issued, insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof; (3) FHLB deposits; and (4) other real estate-related collateral that has a readily ascertainable value and with respect to which a security interest can be perfected. The aggregate amount of outstanding advances collateralized by such other real estate-related collateral may not exceed 300% of ASB’s capital.
 ASB’s required holding in the stock of the FHLB is both membership and activity-based. Membership is based on a percentage of total assets (0.12%) while the portion related to activity is based on a percentage of outstanding activity, mainly advances (4%). As of December 31, 2022, ASB was required and owned capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines in the amount of $26.6 million.
Community Reinvestment.  The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. The OCC will consider ASB’s CRA record in evaluating an application for a new deposit facility, including the establishment of a branch, the relocation of a branch or office, or the acquisition of an interest in another bank. ASB currently holds a “satisfactory” CRA rating.
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Rules. The Federal Reserve Board announced the adoption of a final rule that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U. S. Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Financial Research, publishes SOFR daily. In particular, some residential mortgage promissory notes held by ASB are based on LIBOR but do not identify a specific replacement index. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act addresses the issue by specifying a specific SOFR rate that replaces certain LIBOR rates. ASB is preparing itself to meet the June 30, 2023, deadline.
Other laws.  ASB is subject to federal and state consumer protection laws which affect deposit and lending activities, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and several federal and state financial privacy acts intended to protect consumers’ personal information and prevent identity theft, such as the Gramm Act and the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act. ASB is also subject to federal laws regulating certain of its lending practices, such as the Flood Disaster Protection Act, and laws requiring reports to regulators of certain customer transactions, such as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act. ASB’s relationship with Cetera Investment Services LLC and Cetera Investment Advisers LLC is also governed by regulations adopted by the FRB under the Gramm Act, which regulate “networking” relationships under which a financial institution refers customers to a broker-dealer for securities services and employees of the financial institution are permitted to receive a nominal fee for the referrals. These laws may provide for substantial penalties in the event of noncompliance.
Proposed legislation.  See the discussion of proposed legislation in “Bank–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Environmental regulation.  ASB may be subject to the provisions of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), ERL and regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose liability for environmental cleanup costs on certain categories of responsible parties. CERCLA and ERL exempt persons whose ownership 
in a facility is held primarily to protect a security interest, provided that they do not participate in the management of the facility.
Additional information.  For additional information about ASB, see the sections under “Bank” in HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including Note 4 thereto.
Properties.  ASB owns or leases several office buildings in Honolulu and owns land on which a number of its branches are located.
The following table sets forth the number of bank branches owned and leased by ASB by island:

 | Number of branches
December 31, 2022 | Owned | Leased | | Total
Oahu | 8 | | 19 | | 27
Maui | 1 | | 4 | | 5 
Hawaii | 2 | | 1 | | 3 
Kauai | 1 | | 1 | | 2 
Molokai | — | | 1 | | 1 
 | 12 | | 26 | | 38


As of December 31, 2022, the net book value (NBV) of branches and office facilities was $171 million ($165 million represents the NBV of the land and improvements for the branches and office facilities owned by ASB and $6 million represents the NBV of ASB’s leasehold improvements). As of December 31, 2021, the NBV of branches and office facilities was $175 million ($168 million represents the NBV of the land and improvements for the branches and office facilities owned by ASB and $7 million represents the NBV of ASB’s leasehold improvements). The leases expire on various dates through December 2040, but many of the leases have extension provisions.
As of December 31, 2022, ASB owned 122 automated teller machines.
In January and February 2023, ASB closed two branches on the island of Oahu that were leased by the Bank.
