Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
Our Business
Tiptree is a holding company that combines insurance operations with investment management capabilities. Our principal operating subsidiary is a leading provider of specialty insurance products and related services. We also allocate capital across a broad spectrum of businesses, assets and other investments. 
Our business is comprised of the following types of operations and investments:

• | Specialty Insurance


◦ | Operations - Our insurance operations underwrite and administer programs and products for our clients, including credit protection insurance, warranty and service contract products, and niche commercial and consumer insurance programs.


◦ | Investments - The funds in our insurance investment portfolio are generated by our underwriting activities, with a majority of the portfolio invested in high quality corporate, government and municipal bonds to support our claims paying activities. Benefiting from our investment management capabilities, our insurance portfolio from time to time, includes investments that are generated from the activities of Tiptree Capital and other alternative investments.


• | Tiptree Capital - Our non-insurance capital is typically allocated across four broad sectors where we have developed a track record of investment expertise - asset management, mortgage operations, real assets and credit-related investments. Today, Tiptree Capital consists of our investment in Invesque, asset management operations, mortgage operations, dry bulk shipping operations and other investments.

Our Executive Committee, which is composed of our Executive Chairman and CEO, is responsible for allocating capital between insurance operations, insurance investments and Tiptree Capital. In addition, the Executive Committee also uses its investment expertise to assist in the selection of alternative investments in our insurance company portfolio.
Our strategic objectives are focused on:

• | expanding our insurance operations, while continuing to be a leading provider of specialty insurance products and maintaining our strong underwriting performance;


• | continuing to grow and expand the businesses and investments within Tiptree Capital; and


• | generating enhanced, risk adjusted investment returns.

Our financial goals are to generate consistent and growing earnings and cash flow and to enhance shareholder value as measured by growth in book value per share plus dividends.
As of December 31, 2018, Tiptree and its consolidated subsidiaries had 972 employees (of which 946 were full time employees), 27 of which were at Tiptree’s corporate headquarters and are full time employees.

Significant Developments
On February 1, 2018, we sold our senior living operations to Invesque in exchange for 16.6 million common shares of Invesque. Tiptree’s increase to book value as a result of the sale was $1.16 per share, inclusive of a pre-tax $10.7 million earnout gain related to Invesque’s December 2018 sale of specified properties formerly owned by Care. 
On April 10, 2018, we completed a corporate reorganization that eliminated Tiptree’s dual class stock structure.
Effective January 1, 2019, we began re-positioning our asset management platform, by agreeing to invest $75 million to seed new investment funds in exchange for management control of and a profit participation in Tricadia.
In 2018, we returned $19.2 million to investors through $14.2 million of share buy-backs and $5.0 million of dividends paid. Through March 11, 2019, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $9.1 million resulting in Common Shares outstanding of 34.5 million as of March 11, 2019.
Our Competitive Advantage
We believe our structure as a public company gives us the ability to have a long-term focus on maximizing returns to our shareholders. We believe this long-term perspective provides us the flexibility when investing our capital to focus on strategy and profitability through multiple market cycles, including those that may negatively impact GAAP earnings and/or the book value of our holdings in the short term. 
Competition
Our businesses face competition, as discussed below. In addition, we are subject to competition for acquisitions and investment opportunities. Our competitors include commercial and investment banks, mortgage companies, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, asset managers, private equity funds, hedge funds, family offices, real estate investment trusts, limited partnerships, business development companies and special purpose acquisition vehicles. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater access to capital and other resources and may possess other competitive advantages.
Our businesses are subject to regulation as described below. The 1940 Act may limit the types and nature of businesses that we engage in and assets that we may acquire. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters-Maintenance of our 1940 Act exemption will impose limits on our operations.”
Specialty Insurance 
Overview
Our specialty insurance segment is conducted through Fortegra Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Fortegra”), an insurance holding company incorporated in 1981. Our insurance business underwrites and administers specialty insurance programs and products, primarily in the United States, and is a leading provider of credit and asset protection products and administration services. Our programs are provided across a diverse range of products and services including credit protection insurance, warranty and service contract products, and underwriting of niche personal and commercial lines of insurance. 
Products and Services
Credit Protection Insurance Products - Our credit protection insurance products are designed to offer consumers protection from life events that limit a borrower’s ability to make payments on outstanding loan balances. These products offer consumers the option to protect credit card and installment loan balances or payments in the event of death, involuntary unemployment or disability.
6

Warranty and Service Contract Products - Our warranty and service contract products provide consumers with coverage on automobiles, mobile devices, consumer electronics, appliances, and furniture and bedding, protecting them from certain covered losses. These products offer replacement, service or repair coverage in the event of mechanical breakdown, accidental damage, theft and water damage. Our warranty and service contract products are extensions of warranty coverage originally provided by original equipment manufacturers.
Other Specialty Programs - We also offer programs focused on fronting and underwriting certain niche light commercial and personal lines insurance coverages for general agents and other program managers that require broad licensure, an “A-” or better A.M. Best rating, and specialized knowledge and expertise to distribute their products. We grant these general agents and program managers’ authority to produce, underwrite and administer policies subject to our underwriting and pricing guidelines. We typically transfer all or a substantial portion of the underwriting risk on these programs to third-party reinsurers for which we are paid a fee. We have a particular focus on “short-duration” lines of business where the time between the issuance of a policy or contract and reporting and payment of the claim tends to be shorter.
Services and Other - We have several other products which provide value-add services to Fortegra customers, including premium finance and business processing services.
Marketing and Distribution
We distribute our credit and warranty products through distribution partnerships with our clients, including consumer finance companies, retailers, automobile dealers, credit card issuers, credit unions and regional and community banks. We leverage our clients’ brand and customer base to distribute multiple products and services. Our specialty light commercial and personal program insurance products are generally marketed through a network of independent insurance brokers and managing general agencies. In each case, we pay a commission-based fee to our marketing partners.
We generally target markets that are niche and specialty in nature, which we believe are underserved by competitors and have high barriers to entry. We focus on establishing quality client relationships and emphasizing customer service. This focus, along with our ability to help clients enhance revenue and reduce costs, has enabled us to develop and maintain numerous long-term client relationships.
A significant portion of our marketing partnership commission agreements are on a retrospective commission basis, which allows us to adjust commissions on the basis of claims experience. Under these types of arrangements, the compensation to our marketing partners is based upon the actual losses incurred compared to premiums earned. We believe these types of contractual arrangements align their economic interests with ours, help us to better manage our risk exposure and deliver more consistent profit margins with respect to these types of arrangements.
Investment Portfolio
Our investment strategy is designed to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns across select asset classes, sectors and geographies while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our claims payment obligations. We rely on conservative underwriting practices to generate investable funds while minimizing our underwriting risk. We invest a majority of our investable assets in high quality corporate, government and municipal bonds with relatively short durations, designed to deliver sufficient liquidity to meet claims as incurred. The balance of our investable assets are invested in asset classes that we believe will produce higher risk- adjusted returns over the long term, a significant portion of which are managed by us.
Risk Management
Consistent with standard industry practice for most insurance companies, we use reinsurance to manage our underwriting risk and efficiently utilize capital. For example, a significant portion of our distribution partners of credit protection insurance and warranty products have created captive reinsurance companies to assume the insurance risk on the products they distribute. These captive reinsurance companies are known as producer owned reinsurance companies (“PORC”) and in many instances each PORC assumes almost all of the underwriting risk associated with the insurance products they distribute. In these instances we act in a fronting and administrative capacity on behalf of each PORC, providing underwriting and claims management services. We receive an administration fee that compensates us for our expenses associated with underwriting and servicing the underlying policies and provide us with stable margins for these services. We generally require cash collateral to secure the reinsurance recoverable in the event that a PORC is unable to pay the claims it has assumed. In our niche light commercial and personal insurance program business, our reinsurers tend to be highly rated, well-capitalized professional third-party reinsurers.

Our Competitive Strengths
Specialty Focus
We have a history of operating in niche insurance markets that require specialized knowledge, administrative capabilities and expertise to profitably service and/or underwrite policies or insurance coverages. Our expertise and focus, developed over Fortegra’s 35-year history, has contributed to our position as one of the leading providers of credit insurance products in the United States. In addition, our “A-” (Excellent) (stable outlook) rating by A.M. Best and broad licensure provide us the opportunity to write niche commercial and personal lines insurance programs through managing general agents and other program managers to whom we have granted authority to produce, underwrite and administer policies that meet our underwriting and pricing guidelines. In the markets we serve, we focus on underwriting small premium policies and contracts where we can utilize our technology and refined administration processes to manage efficiently the high volume of policies and claims that result from serving large numbers of small policyholders and contract holders. We believe these markets tend to have fewer competitors and higher barriers to entry than other segments of the insurance market, providing us with greater flexibility on pricing and terms, and better, more consistent underwriting margins. We expect to continue to expand into other niche markets where we believe we can capitalize on opportunities presented by our underwriting expertise and operating platform.
Broad Service Delivery Expertise
Over the years, we have invested resources and developed the expertise to provide a variety of products and services for our marketing and distribution partners, including policy underwriting and issuance, back office processing and administration and claims management. Integrated, proprietary technology delivers low cost, highly automated services to our clients, while our scalable technology infrastructure affords us the opportunity to add new clients and services without significant additional expense. The breadth of our capabilities enables us to provide multiple services to each client, thus creating the opportunity to generate more revenue and establish more entrenched relationships with clients. We believe our broad capabilities and consistent service delivery are key drivers of our high client retention rates. In our credit protection insurance products, our annual renewal rates are consistently in excess of 90%, which we believe is among the highest in the industry and distinguishes us from many of our peers.
Significant Fee-based Revenue
We seek to complement our underwriting income with substantial fee-based revenues from the various value-added services we provide our marketing and distribution partners. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from fees and are not solely dependent upon the underwriting performance of our insurance products, resulting in more diversified and consistent earnings. Our fee based revenues are primarily generated in both our regulated insurance entities as well as non-regulated service companies. We believe fees generated outside of regulated insurance entities afford us greater financial flexibility than traditional insurance carriers.
Investment Capabilities
Our investment management operations provide access to broad investment expertise and a range of investment opportunities. We believe our ability to source investments provides us access to a broader universe of investment opportunities, providing us the opportunity to generate superior risk-adjusted investment returns over the long term compared to what a traditional insurer might produce on its own, which we believe distinguishes us from many other insurance companies.
Market Opportunity
Credit Insurance
We are one of the leading providers of credit insurance protection products in the United States and believe we are well positioned to increase our market share both organically and through acquisition. We believe our capabilities and reputation have allowed us to better position ourselves competitively for business as we compete for new business and renewals in the marketplace. We also believe our market position, capabilities and reputation will make us a preferred acquisition partner for smaller competitors that may choose to exit the market or desire a partner with more resources.
Warranty Products
We believe we can significantly increase our market presence in the warranty sector. We entered the warranty market as a natural extension of our business given that it possesses similar attributes and distribution channels as our credit-insurance products. In 2012, our insurance business acquired a provider of wireless-device protection plans and mobile services. Our warranty market gross premiums grew to $123.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, a $13.4 million or 12.2% increase from the year ended 
8

December 31, 2017. We believe the demand from consumers for products such as automobile, furniture, and electronics warranties and mobile device protection will continue to drive long-term growth opportunities for us.
International Markets
We are in the process of selectively expanding our product offerings to international markets such as Asia, Europe and Canada, where we believe profitable opportunities exist. In March 2018, we expanded into Europe with the establishment of a Malta insurance company. We believe our existing product offerings can be successfully distributed in these markets while maintaining similar levels of underwriting performance as our core United States markets.
Competition
We operate in several markets, and believe that no single competitor competes against us in all of our business lines. The competition in the markets in which we operate is a function of many factors, including price, industry knowledge, quality of client service, sales force effectiveness, technology platforms and processes, the security and integrity of information systems, financial strength ratings, breadth of products and services, brand recognition and reputation. Our credit protection products and warranty service contracts compete with similar products of insurance companies, warranty companies and other insurance service providers. Many of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater access to capital and may possess other competitive advantages. These products compete with several multi-national and regional insurance companies that may have expertise in our niche products. Our competitors include: The Warranty Group, Inc., Assurant, Inc., eSecuritel Holdings, LLC, Asurion, LLC, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., State National Companies Inc. and several smaller regional companies.
Regulation
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulation and supervision. Our insurance subsidiaries are generally restricted by the insurance laws of their respective domiciles as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of the respective regulatory authorities. Generally, the maximum dividend that may be paid by an insurance subsidiary during any year without prior regulatory approval is limited to a stated percentage of that subsidiary’s statutory surplus as of a certain date, or net income of the subsidiary for the preceding year.
Our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled in California, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana and Wisconsin. The regulation, supervision and administration by state departments of insurance relate, among other things, to: standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, restrictions on the payment of dividends, changes in control of insurance companies, the licensing of insurers and their agents and other producers, the types of insurance that may be written, privacy practices, the ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets, the nature of and limitations on investments and premium rates, or restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, payment of sales compensation to third parties, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including underwriting and claims practices. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are domiciled in their states.
Our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to certain state regulations which require diversification of our investment portfolios and concentration limits among asset classes. Failure to comply with these regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets in the states in which we are licensed to sell insurance policies for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require us to sell those investments. Such investment laws are generally permissive with respect to federal, state and municipal obligations, and more restrictive with respect to corporate obligations, particularly non-investment grade obligations, foreign investment, equity securities and real estate investments. Each insurance company is therefore limited by the investment laws of its state of domicile from making excessive investments in any given security (such as single issuer limitations) or in certain classes or riskier investments (such as aggregate limitation in non-investment grade bonds).
The NAIC provides model insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states and standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance. However, model insurance laws and regulations are only effective when adopted by the states, and statutory accounting and reporting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. The NAIC has adopted a model act with risk-based capital (“RBC”) formulas to be applied to insurance companies to measure the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile. State insurance regulators use RBC standards to determine appropriate actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions. The domiciliary states of our insurance company subsidiaries have adopted laws substantially similar to the NAIC’s RBC model act.

Fortegra is subject to the respective state insurance holding company statutes which may require prior regulatory approval or non-disapproval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate or of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer and payments of extraordinary dividends or distributions.
Our reinsurance companies that are domiciled in Turks and Caicos must satisfy local regulatory requirements, such as filing annual financial statements, filing annual certificates of compliance and paying annual fees.
We are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to the administration of insurance products on behalf of other insurers. In order for us to process and administer insurance products of other companies, we are required to maintain licenses of a third party administrator in the states where those insurance companies operate. We are also subject to the related federal and state privacy laws and must comply with federal and state data protection and privacy laws. We are also subject to laws and regulations related to call center services.
Seasonality
Our financial results historically have been, and we expect to continue to be, affected by seasonal variations. Revenues may fluctuate seasonally based on consumer spending, which has historically been higher in September and December, corresponding to the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Accordingly, our revenues have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the first half of the year. Member benefit claims on mobile device protection are typically more frequent in the summer months, and accordingly, claims expense from those products have historically been higher in the second and third quarters than other times of the year.
Intellectual Property
We own or license a number of trademarks, patents, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to our services and products. Although we believe that these intellectual property rights are, in the aggregate, of material importance to our business, we also believe that our business is not materially dependent upon any particular trademark, trade name, copyright, service mark, license or other intellectual property right. Our insurance subsidiaries have entered into confidentiality agreements with their clients that impose restrictions on client use of our proprietary software and other intellectual property rights.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, our specialty insurance segment employed 393 employees of which 391 were on a full time basis.
Tiptree Capital 
Tiptree allocates its non-insurance capital across a broad spectrum of businesses, assets and other investments which is comprised of our non-reportable operating segments and other businesses, which we refer to as Tiptree Capital. We manage Tiptree Capital on a total return basis, balancing current cash flow and long term value appreciation.
When assessing potential acquisitions and investments, we look for opportunities that:

• | have strong and experienced management teams;


• | generate attractive and stable cash returns;


• | complement existing businesses or strategies; and


• | have sustainable and scalable business models.

Tiptree has historically focused its capital allocated to Tiptree Capital in four major sectors described below. However, we anticipate the nature, mix and type of investments could change over time.

• | Asset Management - Our asset management activities have historically specialized in managing credit related assets, on behalf of pension funds, hedge funds, other asset management firms, banks, insurance companies and other types of institutional investors. We earn management fees based on the amount of AUM that we manage, incentive income based on the performance of our funds or investment vehicles, and investment income from investments we make in our own funds and investment vehicles. Today, our asset management operations are conducted through TAMCO, an SEC-registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2018, we managed $1.7 billion of fee earning AUM, including CLOs and a credit opportunity fund.

• | Specialty Finance - Our Specialty Finance activities have been focused broadly within the sector, including commercial credit, consumer credit and mortgage origination. Historically, we have realized on our invested capital allocated to an asset backed commercial lender, and a jumbo mortgage originator. Today, we own Reliance, which originates conforming and government single family, residential mortgage loans, primarily sold to secondary market investors. Reliance also owns a small servicing portfolio, subserviced by a third party. Revenues are generated from gain on sale of loans, net interest income and loan fee income, and to a lesser extent, servicing fee income.


• | Real Assets - Historically, our capital in this sector has been allocated to real estate, primarily in commercial real estate and seniors housing. Today, we own 16.6 million common shares of Invesque, a real estate investment company that specializes in health care and senior living property investment throughout North America, which we received as consideration when we sold our senior living business in February 2018. In addition, we have $50.1 million of capital allocated to dry bulk vessels managed by a third party.


• | Credit Investments - Historically, we have owned subordinated notes in the CLO’s we managed, and have engaged in select hedging strategies. Today, the credit investments we own and manage are held in our insurance portfolio in the form of the ownership of vertical slices of CLO liabilities and a leveraged credit opportunities fund.

Competitive Strengths
The depth and breadth of experience of our Executive Committee and management team enables us to source, structure, execute and manage the capital allocated to our non-insurance businesses and investments. In addition, in each of our non-insurance businesses, we benefit by partnering with experienced management teams and third party managers, which we have hired or chosen based on their depth of experience in their respective sectors.
Competition
In the sectors in which Tiptree Capital participates, the markets are highly competitive, There are a large number of competitors offering similar products and services, including many that operate on a international scale, and which are often affiliated with major multi-national companies, commercial financial institutions or investment banks. Many of these organizations have substantially more personnel and greater financial and commercial resources than we do. Some of these competitors have proprietary products and distribution capabilities that may make it more difficult for us to compete with them. Some competitors also have greater name recognition, have managed their businesses for longer periods of time, have greater experience over a wider range of products or have other competitive advantages. 
Regulation
In the sectors in which Tiptree Capital participates, we are subject to extensive regulation by international, federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the SEC, CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission, the European Union, the UK and various state agencies. Our asset manager is registered with the SEC as an investment advisor and is subject to various federal and state laws and regulations and rules of various securities regulators and exchanges. These laws and regulations primarily are intended to protect clients and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
Our dry bulk shipping business and the operation of our vessels are regulated under international conventions, classification societies, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate, as well as in the country or countries of their registration, that mandate safety and environmental protection policies. Government regulation of vessels, particularly environmental regulations, have become more stringent and may require us to incur significant capital expenditures on our vessels. Our international operations and activities also expose us to risks associated with trade and economic sanctions, prohibitions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union and its member countries. Under economic and trade sanctions laws, governments may seek to impose modifications to, prohibitions/restrictions on business practices and activities, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and, in the event of a violation, may subject us to fines and other penalties. In our international activities, we are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and similar laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. We operate in countries known to present heightened risks for corruption, and our dry bulk shipping and related operations requires us to interact with government officials, including port officials, harbor masters, maritime regulators, customs officials and pilots. 
11

Our mortgage operations must comply with a number of federal, state and local consumer protection and privacy laws including laws that apply to loan origination, fair lending, debt collection, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, Tiptree Capital’s combined operations had 552 employees of which 528 were on a full time basis.
