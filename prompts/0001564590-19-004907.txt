Item 1.       Business
Overview
 Moelis & Company is a leading global independent investment bank that provides innovative strategic and financial advice to a diverse client base, including corporations, governments and financial sponsors. We assist our clients in achieving their strategic goals by offering comprehensive, globally integrated financial advisory services across all major industry sectors. Our team of experienced professionals advises clients on their most critical decisions, including mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”), recapitalizations and restructurings, capital markets transactions and other corporate finance matters.
 Moelis & Company was founded in 2007 by veteran investment bankers to create a global independent investment bank that offers multi-disciplinary solutions and exceptional transaction execution combined with the highest standard of confidentiality and discretion. We create lasting client relationships by providing focused innovative advice through a highly collaborative and global approach not limited to specific products or access to particular regions. Our compensation model fosters our holistic approach to clients by emphasizing quality of advice and is not a commission based structure where employees are compensated on a defined percentage of the revenues they generate. We believe our discretionary approach to compensation leads to exceptional advice, strong client impact and enhanced internal collaboration.
 Since our inception, we have achieved rapid growth by hiring high‑caliber professionals, expanding the scope and geographic reach of our advisory services, developing new client relationships and cultivating our professionals through training and mentoring. Today we serve our clients with nearly 600 advisory professionals, including 130 Managing Directors, based in 19 geographical locations around the world. We have demonstrated strong financial performance, achieving revenues of $885.8 million in 2018, our eleventh full year of operations, and have advised on over $2.5 trillion of transactions since inception.

Our Advisory Offering
 We offer holistic advisory solutions to clients by integrating our bankers’ deep industry knowledge and broad corporate finance experience with our global capabilities. With 19 geographical locations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, we combine local and regional expertise with international market knowledge to provide highly integrated information flow and strong cross‑border capabilities. Since our founding, we have rapidly scaled our global platform, as we believe clients value our ability to be relevant in their local market as well as to provide valuable global insights.
 We combine our global capabilities with expertise in all major industries including Consumer, Retail & Restaurants; Energy, Power & Infrastructure; Financial Institutions; Financial Sponsors; General Industrials; Healthcare; Real Estate, Gaming, Lodging & Leisure and Technology, Media & Telecommunications. We collaborate globally to bring our deep industry knowledge to the local markets where our clients operate.
 We focus on a wide range of clients from large public multinational corporations to middle market private companies to individual entrepreneurs, and we deliver the full resources of our firm and the highest level of senior attention to every client, regardless of size or situation.
 We advise our clients through all phases of the business cycle using our strong capabilities in M&A, recapitalization and restructuring, capital markets advisory and other advisory services.
 We have established a premier M&A franchise advising clients on mergers, acquisitions, sales and divestitures. We counsel our clients through all stages of the process as we evaluate strategic alternatives, assess potential acquirers and targets, provide valuation analyses and advise on transaction terms including valuation, structuring, timing and potential financing. Additionally, we have an exclusive sales franchise with a strong track record in achieving maximum value for clients in their sale processes.
 Moelis & Company has substantial expertise in guiding special committees of boards of directors to evaluate strategies and negotiate proposals by leveraging decades of transaction experience. We execute a rigorous process to help special committees synthesize alternatives and develop an appropriate course of action. We bring a strong understanding of key deal points and the interplay between deal terms, value and the various stakeholders involved.
 Moelis & Company’s shareholder defense team provides corporate boards with effective solutions to a broad range of contested shareholder situations. We draw from decades of experience working with both public companies, boards and management to advise clients across every industry, at every stage of an activist campaign; from privately engaging with shareholders to stave off a formal campaign, to defending the company’s interests in a proxy fight or hostile media campaign.
 For our clients in financial distress, we partner senior recapitalization and restructuring professionals with our industry, M&A and capital markets experts to provide holistic advice. We advise both companies and creditors, utilizing our strong relationship network to access capital, identify potential partners and drive support for our transactions. Since our inception, almost 60% of our recapitalization and restructuring engagements have been on the company or debtor side of a transaction. We understand that during times of financial distress, having a true partner as an advisor is of critical importance, and our partnership and collaboration with our clients during these times has helped us develop long‑lasting company relationships. In addition, our deep relationships throughout the creditor and recapitalization and restructuring communities provide multiple creditor side origination opportunities and allow us to develop a comprehensive perspective from all constituents. We understand that in distressed situations, many creditors become temporary equity holders of businesses, and we help these clients realize value which leads to further M&A activity for us.
 As part of our holistic approach to client service, we have substantial experience in advising clients on complex risk exposures. Our team consists of experts in structured products, securitization, derivatives and risk management who are highly qualified to value complex assets and advise on repositioning and divesting underperforming portfolios. These capabilities have been particularly relevant to our financial institutions clients since the global financial crisis.
 We also advise clients on capital markets matters, providing comprehensive capital structure advice and developing financing solutions tailored to the specific needs of issuers. Our independence and objectivity, coupled with our direct and long‑standing institutional buy‑side relationships, inform our market views and enhance the likelihood of a successful transaction. We advise clients on all aspects of public and private debt and equity transactions.

We provide capital raising, secondary transaction and other advisory services to private fund sponsors and limited partners. Our team’s extensive experience raising capital for a wide variety of fund sponsors located in North America, Europe, Asia and the emerging markets is fully integrated with our global platform, ensuring the broadest possible marketing efforts for our clients. We specialize in private equity fund structures across a wide range of strategies, including buyout, growth capital, distressed, special situations, venture and sector‑specific strategies.
 In addition, we provide a broad range of other financial advisory services tailored to the specific circumstances and needs of our clients. For example, we act as defense advisor to boards of directors responding to unsolicited proposals, we act as expert witness for clients in major litigation and we assist private clients and governments in negotiations of significant commercial matters.
 We seek to generate repeat business from our clients by becoming long‑term partners with them as opposed to being solely transaction focused. We are also committed to developing new client relationships, and we maintain an active dialogue with a large number of potential clients, as well as with their financial and legal advisors, on an ongoing basis. We continue to penetrate new relationships through our business development initiatives, growing our senior team with professionals who bring additional client relationships and through introductions from our strong network of relationships with senior executives, board members, attorneys and other third parties.
 Our Key Competitive Strengths
 With 19 geographical locations around the world, capabilities in all major industries and deep advisory expertise, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the strong market opportunity for independent investment banks. Furthermore, we believe our business is differentiated from that of our competitors in the following respects:
 Globally Integrated Firm with Innovative Advisory Solutions:  We provide the high‑touch and conflict free benefits of an independent investment bank with the global reach, sector depth and product expertise more commonly found at larger financial institutions. With 19 geographical locations in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, we combine local and regional expertise with international market knowledge to provide our clients with highly integrated information flow and strong cross‑border capabilities. We harness the deep industry expertise and broad corporate finance experience of our 130 global Managing Directors, which include 66 former sector and product heads from major investment banks. We reinforce our model with a discretionary incentive compensation structure that encourages a high degree of collaboration and our “One Firm” mentality.
 Advisory Focus with Strong Intellectual Capital:  We primarily focus on advising clients, unlike most of our major competitors who derive a large percentage of their revenues from lending, trading and underwriting securities. We believe this independence allows us to offer advice free from the actual or perceived conflicts associated with lending to clients or trading in their securities. In addition, our focus on advisory services frees us from the pressure of cross‑selling products, which we believe can distract from the dialogue with clients around their long‑term strategy, compromising the advice. We provide intellectual capital based on our judgment, expertise and relationships combined with intense senior level attention to all transactions. The business of delivering intellectual capital allows us to operate a low risk and capital light model with attractive profit margins. We are not exposed to the financial risk and regulatory requirements that arise from, or the capital investments required in, balance sheet lending and trading activities.
 Fast Growing Global Independent Investment Bank:  Since our inception in 2007, we have achieved rapid growth, earning revenues of $886 million in 2018. In our early years, we took advantage of the dislocation in the financial services industry following the global financial crisis and capitalized on the unique opportunity to hire talent. We currently have 19 offices globally with 842 employees, including 130 Managing Directors who have on average over 20 years of investment banking experience. We believe the quality and scale of our global franchise and the speed at which it has been achieved would be a challenge to replicate today.
 Strong Financial Discipline:  We have remained financially disciplined with an intense focus on managing our organic growth in a profitable manner. We hired aggressively during the global financial crisis to take advantage of the dislocation among our competitors and in recent years have taken a more measured approach to hiring as the markets and compensation levels have stabilized. We are also highly focused on growing our Managing Directors through internal promotions, adding to our talent base with individuals that are engrained 
 4


in our culture and have proven track records on our platform. Currently, approximately 30% of our Managing Directors have been internally promoted. We believe our investment in talent at the junior level creates a self-sustaining pool of Managing Director talent, which in turn helps us manage profitable growth and allows us to return more capital to shareholders in the long run. We incentivize our bankers as owners by awarding equity compensation in order to align the interests of our employees and equity holders. Additionally, we have focused on entering new regions and sectors through cost effective strategies. We intend to maintain our financial discipline as we continue to grow our revenues, expand into new markets and increase our areas of expertise.
 Significant Organic Growth Opportunities:  We have made significant investments in our intellectual capital with the hiring or promotion of over 70 Managing Directors in the last five years. In addition, we have invested time and resources in our recruiting and training and development programs. We established a meaningful presence at the top undergraduate programs in our first year of operations, which has resulted in the hiring of over 600 analysts and associates from campus since our inception. We are poised to continue realizing meaningful organic growth from these investments. We have achieved critical size in key industry sectors and regions around the globe, as well as recognition for advising on innovative transactions, which have enhanced our brand globally. We are positioned to continue to grow revenues as a result of increased individual productivity as our investments in people mature and as we continue to leverage our global platform through enhanced connectivity and idea generation and expanded brand recognition.
 High Standard of Confidentiality and Discretion:  Due to the highly sensitive nature of M&A discussions where confidentiality is of paramount importance to clients, the M&A business is most effectively operated on a “need to know” basis. We believe that large financial conglomerates with multiple divisions, “Chinese Walls” and layers of management have a significantly greater number of employees who have access to sensitive client information, which can increase the risk of confidential information leaking. Such leaks can materially impair the viability of transactions and other strategic decisions. We have established a high standard of confidentiality and discretion, as well as instituted procedures designed to protect our clients and minimize the risk of sensitive information leaking to the market.
 Diversified Advisory Platform:  Our business is highly diversified across sectors, types of advisory services and clients. Our broad corporate finance expertise positions us to advise clients through any phase of their life cycle and in any economic environment. We focus on a wide range of clients from large public multinational corporations to middle market private companies to individual entrepreneurs, and we deliver the full resources of our firm and the highest level of senior attention to every client, regardless of size or situation. In addition, we have no meaningful client concentration, with our top 10 transactions representing less than 20% of our revenues in 2018. Our holistic “One Firm” approach also reduces dependence on any one product or banker and allows us to leverage our intellectual capital across the firm as necessary to offer multiple solutions to our clients, increase our client penetration and adapt to changing circumstances.
 Partnership Culture:  We believe that our momentum and commitment to excellence have created an environment that attracts and retains high quality talent. Our people are our most valuable asset and our goal is to attract, retain and develop the best and brightest talent in our industry across all levels. We strive to foster a collaborative environment, and we seek individuals who are passionate about our business and are a fit with our culture. We have established a compensation philosophy that reinforces our long‑term vision and values by rewarding collaboration, client impact and lasting relationships and encourages employees to put the interests of our clients and our Company first. Above all, our core values nurture a culture of partnership, passion, optimism and hard work, inspiring the highest level of quality and integrity in every interaction with our clients and each other.

Our Growth Strategy
 Our growth strategy is to continue to take advantage of what we believe are attractive market opportunities to enhance our leadership position as a global independent investment bank, advising our clients on important mergers and acquisitions, recapitalization and restructuring transactions and other strategic matters. We seek to achieve these objectives through the following two primary strategies:
 Deepen and Expand our Client Relationships:  We seek to continue to deepen and expand our client relationships, which are the foundation of our business. We are tireless in our pursuit of offering the highest quality integrated advice and most innovative solutions that lead to the long‑term success of our clients. We believe this approach has enhanced our reputation as a trusted advisor to our clients, and we intend to leverage this approach further as we increase our touch points with our clients and develop new client relationships.
 Broaden our Areas of Expertise Based on Client Needs:  We intend to pursue further industry and geographic expansion and introduce new product expertise based on client needs. In addition to hiring high quality professionals who will expand our market share, we will seek to grow through increasing the tenure of our Managing Directors, investing in and training our next generation of Managing Directors and continuing to hire analysts and associates from leading undergraduate and graduate programs. We believe that developing talent internally creates a more sustainable franchise and reinforces the culture of our firm.
Our People
 We believe that our people are our most valuable asset. Our goal is to attract, retain and develop the best and brightest talent in our industry across all levels. We strive to foster a collaborative environment, and we seek individuals who are passionate about our business and fit our culture. Our Managing Directors are compensated based on the quality of advice and execution provided to a client, which is predicated on delivering our full suite of advisory services through a high degree of collaboration across different industries, products and regions. This collaborative approach is demonstrated by the fact that on almost all of our transactions, at least two Managing Directors support the client. We reinforce our long‑term vision and values by rewarding for client impact and lasting relationships. Our year‑end evaluation process measures both performance and alignment with our core value system, ensuring that we continue to integrate our expertise to meaningfully enhance the quality of our advice and strengthen our client relationships. We do not compensate on a commission‑based pay model and do not manage our business based on industry, product or regional silos. Our compensation structure for junior bankers is based on a system of meritocracy whereby bankers are rewarded for top performance.
 We recruit our junior bankers from the world’s leading undergraduate and graduate programs. Since our inception we have had a dedicated campus recruiting effort through which we have hired over 600 analysts and associates from these programs. We devote significant time and resources to training and mentoring our employees and have implemented a generalist program in which our junior professionals receive significant transaction experience across a wide range of products and industries. We believe this exposure enhances the investment banking experience and allows our junior professionals to develop and refine their proficiency in a broad variety of corporate finance matters at an early stage in their career. We are committed to talent retention and our goal is to develop our brightest and most ambitious junior professionals into successful Managing Directors. As of December 31, 2018, we had 845 employees globally, including 583 advisory professionals and 125 Managing Directors.
 Moelis Australia
 In 2009, we opened our sixth global office in Sydney to provide investment banking services in Australia and expand our coverage of the Asia Pacific region. Following the establishment of this office and the hiring of what we believed to be a strong executive team, we entered into a 50%-50% joint venture with Moelis Australia Holdings PTY Limited on April 1, 2010 (“Moelis Australia”). Moelis Australia operates a financial advisory services business, an equity capital markets and research, sales and trading business covering Australian public equity securities and asset management businesses.
 On April 10, 2017, Moelis Australia consummated its initial public offering and became listed on the Australian Securities Exchange as Moelis Australia Limited (ASX: MOE). We continue to hold our original position of 50 million shares of MOE; however, as a result of the initial public offering and subsequent follow-on offerings, the Company’s ownership interest has been diluted to less than 50%. In connection with Moelis Australia’s initial public offering, the Company and Moelis Australia entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement pursuant to which Moelis Australia continues to conduct its investment banking advisory business in Australia and New Zealand as an integrated part of the global advisory business of the Company.

Our Strategic Alliances 
 Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and its Subsidiary, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
 Effective January 1, 2012, we entered into a strategic alliance with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (“SMBC”) and its subsidiary, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. (“Nikko”) to provide advisory services, including advising on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings and other corporate finance matters, to Japanese companies in regions where our firms conduct business. The alliance provides us and our clients with access to the Japanese market and provides us with opportunities to advise Japanese clients on the full suite of our advisory services, with a particular focus on cross‑border M&A. Established in 1876 as Mitsui Bank, SMBC is the second largest bank in Japan based on market capitalization. Nikko is one of the five major securities companies in Japan.
 Alfaro, Dávila y Scherer, S.C.
 Effective September 2, 2016, we entered into a strategic alliance with Alfaro, Dávila y Scherer, S.C. (“ADS”), the leading independent strategic and financial advisory firm in Mexico, to provide advisory services to our global client base with a focus on cross-border transactions. ADS’s successful track record of developing long-term relationships and advising multinational corporations and privately held companies in strategic transactions benefits our global clients looking to expand into Mexico or for Mexican corporates eager to grow internationally. With this strategic alliance, coupled with our office in Brazil, Moelis & Company has a presence in the two largest markets in Latin America. 
 Competition
 The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our competitors are other investment banking and financial advisory firms. We compete on both a global and a regional basis, and on the basis of a number of factors, including depth of client relationships, industry knowledge, transaction execution skills, our range of products and services, innovation, reputation and price.
 We believe our primary competitors in securing advisory engagements include the investment banking businesses of Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and other large investment banking firms as well as independent investment banking firms such as Evercore Partners Inc., Greenhill & Co., Inc., Houlihan Lokey, Inc., Lazard Ltd, NM Rothschild & Sons Limited, PJT Partners, Inc., and many closely held boutique firms.
 We compete to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.
 In past years there has been substantial consolidation in the financial services industry. In particular, a number of large commercial banks and other broad‑based financial services firms have established or acquired broker‑dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products, from loans, deposit‑taking and insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial lending and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressure in our business or loss of opportunities for us. In addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to certain of our competitors who are able to, and regularly do, provide financing or market making services that are often instrumental in effecting transactions. The trend toward consolidation has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors as well as the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of these firms.

Regulation
 Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and across the globe. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets, not with protecting the interests of our stockholders or creditors. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. Moelis & Company LLC, our wholly‑owned subsidiary through which we conduct our financial advisory business in the U.S., is registered as a broker‑dealer with the SEC. Moelis & Company LLC is subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), a self‑regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including Moelis & Company LLC. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over Moelis & Company LLC.
 Broker‑dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including capital structure, record‑keeping and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker‑dealer and member of a self‑regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC’s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3‑1. Rule 15c3‑1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker‑dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker‑dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self‑regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker‑dealer and constrain the ability of a broker‑dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC’s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker‑dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital.
 In addition to the regulation we are subject to in the United States, we are also subject to regulation internationally by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Dubai Financial Services Authority.
 Certain parts of our business are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non‑U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self‑regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage.
 The U.S. and non‑U.S. government agencies and self‑regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease‑and‑desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker‑dealer or its directors, officers or employees.
 Federal anti‑money‑laundering laws make it a criminal offense to own or operate a money transmitting business without the appropriate state licenses, which we maintain, and registration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Treasury Department’s implementing federal regulations require us, as a “financial institution,” to establish and maintain an anti‑money‑laundering program.
 In connection with its administration and enforcement of economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, designated under programs that are not country‑specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called “Specially Designated Nationals,” or SDNs. Assets of SDNs are blocked, and we are generally prohibited from dealing with them. In addition, OFAC administers a number of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes that target certain countries, governments and geographic regions. We are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any country, region or government that is subject to such comprehensive sanctions.
 8


The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the UK 2010 Bribery Act (the “UK Bribery Act”) prohibit the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures. The FCPA has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business abroad, among others, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of foreign government‑run or ‑owned organizations or public international organizations. The FCPA also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Similarly, the UK Bribery Act prohibits us from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.

The Reorganization
 Prior to our initial public offering, our business was owned by Old Holdings. In connection with the consummation of our initial public offering, a reorganization of the existing businesses of Old Holdings was effected pursuant to which the advisory business was transferred to Group LP. Old Holdings retained its asset management business, which includes managers of direct lending funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized loan obligation funds and certain other asset management businesses. Moelis & Company generally does not engage in these activities.
Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of Group LP
 We operate our business through Group LP and its subsidiaries. The provisions governing the operations of Group LP and the rights and obligations of its partners are set forth in the amended and restated limited partnership agreement of Group LP, the material terms of which are described below. The amended and restated limited partnership agreement of Group LP is filed as an exhibit to this Form 10‑K.
 Through our control of the general partner of Group LP, we have unilateral control (subject to the consent of Moelis & Company Partner Holdings LP (“Partner Holdings”) on various matters) over the affairs and decisions of Group LP. As such, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Group LP and the day‑to‑day management of Group LP’s business.
 Voting and Economic Rights
 Group LP issued Class A partnership units to Moelis & Company and to the holders of Old Holdings units at the time of the reorganization. In addition, Group LP issued Class B partnership units to Moelis & Company. The Group LP Class B partnership units correspond with the economic rights of shares of Moelis & Company’s Class B common stock. Group LP Class A unitholders have no voting rights by virtue of their ownership of Group LP partnership units, except for the right to approve certain amendments to the amended and restated limited partnership agreement of Group LP, certain changes to the capital accounts of the limited partners of Group LP and any conversion of Group LP to a corporation other than for purposes of a sale transaction. Partner Holdings holds all shares of Moelis & Company Class B common stock, enabling it to exercise majority voting control over Moelis & Company and, indirectly, over Group LP.
 Pursuant to the Group LP amended and restated limited partnership agreement, we have the right to determine when distributions will be made to the partners of Group LP and the amount of any such distributions. If we authorize a distribution, such distribution will be made, except as required under applicable tax law, to the partners of Group LP (i) in the case of a tax distribution, generally to the holders of partnership units in proportion to the amount of taxable income of Group LP allocated to such holder and (ii) in the case of other distributions, pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective partnership units.
 Coordination of Moelis & Company and Group LP
 At any time we issue a share of Class A common stock for cash, unless we use the proceeds for certain specified permitted purposes (including the acquisition Group LP Class A partnership units or other property), the proceeds received by us will be promptly transferred to Group LP, and Group LP will issue to us one of its Group LP Class A partnership units. At any time we issue a share of Class A common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plan we will contribute to Group LP all of the proceeds that we receive (if any), and Group LP will issue to us one of its Group LP Class A partnership units, having the same restrictions, if any, attached to the shares of Class A common stock issued under the equity incentive plan. Conversely, if we redeem or repurchase any of our shares of Class A common stock, Group LP will, immediately prior to our redemption or repurchase, redeem or repurchase an equal number of Group LP Class A partnership units held by us, upon the same terms and for the same price, as the shares of Class A common stock are redeemed or repurchased. We can only redeem or repurchase shares of Class A common stock if Group LP first redeems or repurchases an equivalent amount of Group LP Class A partnership units that we hold.
 11


Exchange Rights
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Group LP amended and restated limited partnership agreement and the lock‑up restrictions described below, each Group LP Class A unitholder (except for Moelis & Company) has the right to exchange Group LP Class A partnership units, either for shares of our Class A common stock on a one‑for‑one basis, or cash (based on the market price of the shares of Class A common stock), at Group LP’s option. If Group LP chooses to exchange such units for our Class A common stock, Moelis & Company will deliver an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock to Group LP for further delivery to the exchanging holder and receive a corresponding number of newly issued Group LP Class A partnership units. The exchanging holder’s surrendered Group LP Class A partnership units will be cancelled by Group LP. As Group LP Class A unitholders exchange their Group LP Class A partnership units, Moelis & Company’s percentage of economic ownership of Group LP will be correspondingly increased. Following each such exchange, Partner Holdings will be required to surrender to Moelis & Company a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock, and each such share will be converted into approximately 0.00055 shares of Class A common stock, which will be delivered to Partner Holdings. Group LP will also convert an equivalent number of Class B partnership units held by Moelis & Company into Class A partnership units based on the same conversion rate.
 Group LP Class A partnership units and Moelis & Company Class A common stock held by our Managing Directors (including through Partner Holdings) are subject to lock‑up agreements for four years from the date of our initial public offering. After this period, Group LP Class A partnership units held by a Managing Director will become exchangeable into Class A common stock or cash as described above and Moelis & Company Class A common stock held by a Managing Director will become transferable, in each case in three equal installments on each of the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversary of our initial public offering. In connection with the follow-on offerings of Class A common stock in March and August of 2018, the number of Group LP Class A partnership units subject to lock-up decreased and is currently 10,398,557 units. If a Managing Director terminates his or her employment with the Company prior to the end of the lock‑up period, the Company will be entitled to extend the lock‑up period until up to the tenth anniversary of our initial public offering. We may waive the transfer and exchange restrictions set forth in the Group LP amended and restated limited partnership agreement, including in connection with an offering of shares of our Class A common stock by our Managing Directors. In addition, these restrictions cease to apply upon the death or termination of employment by us due to disability of the applicable Managing Director with respect to such Managing Director’s Group LP Class A partnership units.
 Restrictive Covenants of our Managing Directors
 Prior to the expiration of the Managing Director lock‑up, our Managing Directors are generally subject to forfeiting their interests in vested Group LP partnership units and Moelis & Company Class A common stock they held as of the initial public offering if they terminate their employment without good reason and compete with the Company within 12 months thereafter, except for a certain limited number of designated units and stock which were awarded to replace equity of a former employer forfeited upon joining. Our Managing Directors have agreed not to solicit our employees during the term of their employment and for 12 months thereafter.
