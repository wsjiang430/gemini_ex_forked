Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
We own and operate CAKE and getcake.com, a marketing technology company that provides a proprietary solution for advanced analytics, attribution and campaign optimization for digital marketers. Our powerful software-as-a service, or SaaS, is an enterprise solution that has been an industry standard for advertisers, agencies, networks and publishers to measurably analyze and improve digital advertising spend. We currently have over 500 customers driving billions of consumer actions monthly through the CAKE enterprise platform.
 
In late 2017, we introduced Journey by CAKE, a new product family created specifically for brand advertisers and digital agencies. Journey by CAKE is a cloud-based solution that collects and analyzes customer journey data using multi-touch attribution for marketing campaign optimization. Journey by CAKE delivers accurate and actionable insights about the previously missing steps of the anonymous customer journey. With this extended view into vital customer interactions, Journey provides the intelligence needed to move unknown consumers to known customers, boosting campaign performance and return on advertising spend (RoAS). The main features are: Insights, a centralized dashboard which provides valuable customer journey insights that drive real-time decisions; Attribution, campaign spend optimization based on positional and data-driven attribution of key steps in the customer journey; and Connections, seamless integrations with digital media and marketing tools which make collecting customer journey data easier than ever. Journey by CAKE enables brands to move beyond the confines of siloed data and provides customer journey analytics for marketers, in real time.
 
On January 12, 2017, we announced that the CAKE platform was significantly enhanced with a new unified technical architecture and platform to collect and support high-traffic volumes. Now our industry-leading technology not only gathers granular information about the customer path to conversion, but also leverages data science and machine learning to further understand and maximize RoAS. Additionally, our patent-pending algorithmic attribution for predictive analytics clearly and accurately show marketers how to optimize campaigns. These new capabilities enhance our existing rules-driven attribution to programmatically allow marketers to analyze complex customer journeys; arming advertisers with more actionable insights needed to effectively measure the true impact of each media channel and maximize revenue for any given level of spending. 
 
The CAKE SaaS proprietary marketing platform is used by some of the world’s leading companies and largest customer-base of enterprise performance marketing networks and advertisers. CAKE’s platform is based on reliable, feature rich technology and is bolstered by the industry’s leading customer service and top-tier technology partners, assuring the highest level of uptime.
 
On February 14, 2017, Gartner, Inc. once again named us as a Vendor to Watch in its “Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs” report. This research is intended for chief marketing officers (CMOs), chief marketing technologists and other digital marketing leaders involved in the selection of core systems to support digital marketing business requirements. According to Gartner, our solution enables hub-like multichannel data management and onboarding capabilities. CAKE is for enterprise performance marketers looking to track attribution and optimize data-driven lead generation and customer acquisition through affiliate and other digital marketing channels. 
 
Our revenue model is based on monthly recurring license fees, usually pursuant to an annual contract. The contracts typically include a prescribed volume of clicks, impressions, or other events, and are subject to overage charges for volumes in excess of the included amounts. We also charge training and implementation fees, and in certain cases, professional services fees and royalties. A majority of our revenue is derived from clients in the United States. During November 2012, we formed Cake Marketing UK Ltd, or the Subsidiary, a private limited company, which is our wholly-owned subsidiary located in the United Kingdom in order to better provide our services in the European market.
 
Our business is currently headquartered in Newport Beach, California, with operations in Santa Monica, California, London, England and New Delhi, India, allowing us to provide global support to our client base. The CAKE platform supports multiple languages and currencies so online marketers can track the performance of their marketing campaigns and better target their digital spend on a global scale.
 
Our training, support personnel, hosting and cloud-based infrastructure contribute to our cost of operating the business. We anticipate more spending in these areas while we continue to grow, and we can foresee some savings in infrastructure cost due to economies of scale. In addition, development resources were required to continue to enhance our products. Those resources were used to extend our software platform and to create deeper integrations to third-party technologies that include, but are not limited to, Google AdWords, Bing Ads, Facebook, DoubleClick Campaign Manager (DCM), Marketo and others.

We intend to continue to grow revenues by investing in sales, marketing, and product development and innovation. We allocated a portion of our marketing budget to being present at tradeshows, securing coverage in industry publications, and providing the support documentation required by sales initiatives. Additional efforts will be made to speak at industry events, write for media outlets and implement digital marketing campaigns, increasing awareness of the CAKE solutions and the thought leadership driving product development.

In addition, prior to entering into discussions with potential business partners or customers regarding our business and technologies, we generally require that such parties enter into nondisclosure agreements with us. If these discussions result in a license or other business relationship, we also generally require that the agreement setting forth the parties’ respective rights and obligations include provisions for the protection of our intellectual property rights.

Competition 
 
CAKE's products have specific competitors in each of the channels that we track and support. Competitors in the affiliate tracking industry include TUNE/HasOffers and HitPath. Impact Radius and Performance Horizon are privately-held companies with a performance and direct response advertising platform focused on retail tracking. Competitors in the mobile tracking sector include TUNE/Mobile App Tracking and AppsFlyer.
 
Competitors for Journey by CAKE are specific to the product’s functionality. For attribution, our competitors include Google/Adometry, AOL/Convertro and Neilsen/Visual IQ. For analytics and data visualization competitors include Oragami Logic and Beckon. For advertisers that advertise within an affiliate channel, but that want direct relationships with their publishers, ADS/Conversant and Rakuten/Linkshare offer service-based solutions, but do not provide software.
 
Many of our SaaS competitors have significantly greater capital, technology, resources and brand recognition than we do. We differentiate from our competition by providing an enterprise-level, proprietary, cloud-based tracking, attribution and analytics solution. Most competitors have single channel solutions or have a services model. 
 
Government Regulation
 
Although there are currently relatively few laws and regulations directly applicable to our software and the Internet, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and elsewhere. The adoption of restrictive laws or regulations could slow or otherwise affect Internet growth and the development or usage of our software. The application of existing laws and regulations governing Internet and software issues such as property ownership, libel and personal privacy is also subject to substantial uncertainty. There can be no assurance that current or new government laws and regulations, or the application of existing laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, taxation, defamation and personal injury) will not expose us to significant liabilities, slow Internet growth and the development or usage of our software or otherwise hurt us financially.
