ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
Zynex, Inc. was founded by Thomas Sandgaard in 1996, when he founded two privately held companies that eventually were folded into Zynex, Inc. Zynex, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is the parent company of six active and inactive subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s only active subsidiaries are Zynex Medical, Inc. (“ZMI,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation) and Zynex Monitoring Solutions, Inc. (“ZMS,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation). The Company’s inactive subsidiaries include Kestrel Labs, Inc. (“Kestrel,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation), Zynex Europe (“ZEU,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation), Zynex NeuroDiagnostics, Inc. (“ZND,” a wholly-owned Colorado corporation), and Pharmazy, Inc. (“Pharmazy,” a wholly-owned Colorado Corporation), which was incorporated in June 2015. The Company’s compounding pharmacy operated as a division of ZMI dba as Pharmazy through January 2016.
In December 2021, the Company acquired 100% of Kestrel Labs, Inc. (“Kestrel”), a laser-based, noninvasive patient monitoring technology company. Kestrel’s laser-based products include the NiCO™ CO-Oximeter, a noninvasive multi-parameter pulse oximeter, and HemeOx™, a noninvasive total hemoglobin oximeter that enables continuous arterial blood monitoring. Both NiCO and HemeOx are yet to be presented to the FDA for market clearance. All activities related to Kestrel flow through our ZMS subsidiary. ZMS has developed the CM-1500 monitoring system (“CM-1500”) which was granted 510(k) clearance in February 2020 by the FDA in the United States of America. ZMS filed a 510(k) application for the CM-1600 in December 2021, its next generation wireless monitoring system (“CM-1600”) and is continuing to work with the FDA on obtaining clearance. ZMS has achieved no revenues to date.
Substantially all of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2022 and 2021 is attributable to ZMI. Our headquarters are located in Englewood, Colorado.
Active Subsidiaries
Zynex Medical, Inc. (ZMI): ZMI designs, manufactures and markets medical devices that treat chronic and acute pain, as well as activate and exercise muscles for rehabilitative purposes with electrical stimulation. The Company’s devices are intended for pain management to reduce reliance on medications and provide rehabilitation and increased mobility through the utilization of non-invasive muscle stimulation, electromyography technology, interferential current (“IFC”), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (“NMES”) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (“TENS”). All of our medical devices are designed to be patient friendly and designed for home use. Our devices are small, portable, battery operated and include an electrical pulse generator which is connected to the body via electrodes. All of our medical devices are marketed in the U.S. and are subject to FDA regulation and clearance. Our products require a physician’s prescription before they can be dispensed in the U.S. Our primary product is the NexWave device. The NexWave is marketed to physicians and therapists by our field sales representatives. The NexWave requires consumable supplies, such as electrodes and batteries, which are shipped to patients on a recurring monthly basis, as needed.
ZMI distributes complementary products such as lumbar support, cervical traction, knee bracing, and hot/cold therapy. These complement our pain management products and are critical for physicians and therapists. These products require a prescription and are covered by most insurance plans and Medicare.
ZMI designs, manufactures, and markets the NeuroMove product. The NeuroMove contains electromyography and electric stimulation technology that is primarily used for stroke, spinal cord and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation (“SCI”), by reaching parts of the brain to re-connect with muscles, also known as neuroplasticity. The NeuroMove product is primarily marketed to medical clinics. Zynex did not have material sales of this product in 2022 or 2021.
ZMI also designs, manufactures, and markets the InWave product, an in-home electrical stimulation device used to treat female urinary incontinence. The device requires a prescription and is covered by most insurance plans and Medicare. Zynex did not have material sales of this product in 2022 or 2021.

Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):
ZMS was formed in 2011 to develop and market medical devices for non-invasive patient monitoring beginning with our Zynex Monitoring System. The monitor is a non-invasive medical device for monitoring relative fluid volume changes used in operating and recovery rooms to detect fluid loss during surgery and internal bleeding during recovery. The CM-1500 received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in February 2020.
The Zynex Monitoring System has been tested in several Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approved clinical studies, both in well-controlled healthy volunteer settings as well as in clinical use environments. In 2022, the clinical trials were expanded to include the next generation CM-1600. Enrollment was completed in the apheresis blood donation study with Vitalant Research Institute (the research arm of Vitalant, the nation’s largest independent, nonprofit blood services provider) to track changes in the device’s patented Relative Index (“RI”) during apheresis blood donation procedures. Multiple studies were also completed at Yale University where volunteer study subjects underwent simulated hemorrhage using a lower body negative pressure chamber while wearing the device. Finally, enrollment was initiated in a large-scale multi-site study to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the CM-1600 at detecting minor blood loss, which is anticipated to finish recruitment and data collection in the first half of 2023. 
We have built a number of commercial devices in pilot-production and continue to refine the algorithms for the patented Relative Index. We have received two U.S. utility patents for this unique application, the first in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the second in the first quarter of 2021, and we believe this product could serve a currently unmet need in the market for safer surgeries and safer monitoring of patients during recovery.
In addition to FDA clearance, we are pursuing European Union (“EU”) Certificate European (“CE”) Marking. CE Marking is a certification that a product meets the standards established by the 27 nations of the EU and qualifies for sale in the EU and 4-nation European Free Trade Association.
In early 2022, the integration of Kestrel and their pulse oximetry products into the ZMS organization was completed. Pulse oximetry is a commonly used noninvasive monitoring method for estimation of oxygen saturation in arterial blood. The inaccuracies of traditional Light Emitting Diode (“LED”)-based pulse oximeters have recently been highlighted specific to skin pigmentation bias and the inability to accurately measure blood oxygen levels in the presence of other conditions such as in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning or methemoglobinemia. ZMS’s investigational laser-based products are designed to address these inaccuracies and include the novel NiCO™ CO-Oximeter, and HemeOx™, a total hemoglobin oximeter that is designed to enable continuous noninvasive arterial blood monitoring. NiCO is anticipated to be submitted to the FDA for clearance in the third quarter of 2023.
As ZMS’ products are still in development, ZMS did not produce any revenue for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021.
In addition to the fluid volume monitor, ZMS filed for a provisional patent for a non-invasive sepsis monitor in December 2020 and an updated utility patent filed in December 2021.
SALES AND GROWTH STRATEGIES
To date, ZMI accounts for substantially all of our revenue and profit. We are focused on expanding our sales force to address what we believe is an untapped market for electrotherapy products for pain management which has become more attractive due to large competitors exiting the market. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 450 field sales representatives on staff or in the hiring process. We continue to hire field sales representatives at a rapid rate, focusing on the quality of each candidate with the goal of having approximately 500-600 sales representatives in the U.S. by the end of 2023. We will be focused on increasing performance management standards for our sales force.
In an effort to increase revenue and diversification in order to provide our prescribers and patients with diverse solutions for their pain management needs, we are continually adding new complementary products to our ZMI sales channel, such as our hot/cold therapy, cervical traction, knee braces and LSO back braces. In addition, in March 2020 we introduced a full catalog of over 3,300 physical therapy products to promote in the clinics which we serve. We believe adding these complementary products will increase our market share in the marketplace and, in the future, grow our core business by providing our electrotherapy patients additional non-pharmacological pain relief and complementary products to our manufactured devices.

Distribution and Revenue Streams:
Currently, substantially all of our revenue is generated through our ZMI subsidiary from our electrotherapy products. 
We sell through a direct sales force in United States. Our field sales representatives are engaged to sell in predefined geographic markets and are compensated with a base salary and incentives based on the type of product sold and insurance. Our efforts to date have been focused on the United States market. 
Our revenue is derived from several sources including patients with insurance plans held by commercial health insurance carriers or government payers who pay on behalf of their insureds. The remaining portion of revenue is primarily received from workers’ compensation claims and attorneys representing injured patients, hospitals, clinics and private-pay individuals. 
A large part of our revenue is recurring. Recurring revenue results primarily from the sale of surface electrodes and batteries sent to existing patients with our units. Electrodes and batteries are consumable items that are considered an integral part of our products.
Private Labeled Distributed Products
In addition to our own products, we distribute, through our sales force, a number of private labeled supplies and complementary products from other domestic manufacturers. These products generally include patient consumables, such as electrodes and batteries plus cervical traction, lumbar support, knee braces and hot/cold therapy. Customarily, there are no formal contracts between vendors in the durable medical equipment industry. Replacement products and components are easily found, either from our own products or other manufacturers, and purchases are made by purchase order.Products
We currently market and sell Zynex-manufactured products and distribute complementary products and private labeled supplies for Zynex products, as indicated below:

Product Uses
Pain Management and Control
Standard electrotherapy is a clinically proven and medically accepted alternative to manage acute and chronic pain. Electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce most types of local pain, such as tennis elbow, neck or lower back pain, arthritis, and others. The devices used to accomplish this are commonly described as the TENS family of devices. Electrotherapy is not known to have any negative side effects, a significant advantage over most pain relief medications. The benefits of electrotherapy can include: pain relief, increased blood flow, reduced edema, prevention of venous thrombosis, increased range-of-motion, prevention of muscle disuse atrophy, and reduced urinary incontinence.
Electrotherapy introduces an electrical current applied through surface electrodes. The electrical current “distorts” a pain signal on its way to the central nervous system and the brain, thus reducing the pain. Additionally, by applying higher levels of electricity, muscles contract and such contraction is believed to assist in the benefits mentioned above.
Numerous clinical studies have been published over several decades showing the effectiveness of IFC and TENS for pain relief. Our primary electrotherapy device, the NexWave, has received FDA 510(k) clearance. The NexWave is a digital IFC, TENS and NMES device that delivers pain-alleviating electrotherapy.
Stroke and Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation
Our proprietary NeuroMove product is a Class II medical device that has been cleared by the FDA for stroke rehabilitation. Stroke and SCI usually affect a survivor’s mobility, functionality, speech, and memory, and the NeuroMove is designed to help the survivor regain movement and functionality.
Sales of NeuroMove did not generate material revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Hemodynamic Monitoring
Hemodynamic monitoring is the process of measuring the blood flow and pressure exerted in the heart, veins, and arteries. It provides an assessment of a patient’s circulatory status and their ability to assure cardiac output and oxygen delivery to the body. Maintaining effective circulating blood volume and pressure are key to assuring adequate oxygen saturation and perfusion. 
Hemodynamic monitoring devices have been historically classified as, (a) invasive, using a central or pulmonary artery catheter, (b) minimally invasive, with the placement of an arterial line, and (c) noninvasive, where no device is inserted into the body for clinical assessment.

The Zynex Fluid Monitoring System CM-1500 and the Zynex Wireless Fluid Monitoring System CM-1600 are noninvasive monitoring devices designed to measure relative changes in fluid volume in adult patients. Fluid status is determined using Zynex’s proprietary algorithm and expressed as the patented Relative Index™, a simple value designed to accurately trend patient vital signs and alert clinicians for early intervention.
The CM-1500 was cleared by the FDA in 2020. The CM-1600 has been submitted to the FDA and is pending clearance.
Pulse Oximetry Monitoring
Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of measuring the oxygen saturation level (“SpO2”) of arterial blood. As one of the most common medical devices used in and out of hospitals around the world, pulse oximeters have gained widespread clinical acceptance as the standard of care for monitoring oxygen saturation. SpO2 has become the “fifth vital sign”, which, together with heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature, provides crucial clinical information about a person’s health status.
The NiCO™ Noninvasive CO-Oximeter, the first laser-based photoplethysmographic patient monitoring technology, is designed to noninvasively measure and monitor four crucial species of hemoglobin with unprecedented accuracy.
The HemeOx™ Total Hemoglobin Pulse Oximeter is designed to noninvasively measure total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation, two critical parameters that typically require invasive arterial blood sampling for measurement. Total hemoglobin is a very commonly ordered blood test in healthcare, and HemeOx™ measures it with the continuous and noninvasive ease of a pulse oximeter at the patient bedside.
The NiCO™ Noninvasive CO-Oximeter and the HemeOx™ Total Hemoglobin Pulse Oximeter have not yet been cleared by the FDA.
MARKETS
Zynex Medical (ZMI):
To date, the majority of our revenue has been generated by our ZMI electrotherapy products and private labeled supplies. Thus, we primarily compete in the home electrotherapy market for pain management, with products based on IFC, TENS and NMES devices and consumable supplies. We estimate the annual domestic market for home electrotherapy products at approximately $500 million to $1 billion. During 2022 and 2021, we maintained our sales force of approximately 450 direct sales representatives to address what we believe is an underserved electrotherapy market. The current opioid epidemic has been declared a health emergency, and we are uniquely positioned to help reduce the amount of opioids prescribed for treatment of chronic and acute pain symptoms. We are committed to providing health care professionals with alternatives to traditional opioid based treatment programs with our prescription-strength products which have no side effects. This has never been more necessary than it is today considering the staggering statistics.

● | Pain impacts the lives of more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pain is the leading cause of disability, and seeking treatment for chronic or acute pain is the most common reason American’s seek health care. Approximately 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nearly 20 million Americans experienced high-impact chronic pain, defined as “limiting life or work activities on most days or every day”, in the past 3 months.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If pharmaceuticals such as opioids continue to be used as the first line of defense, America will continue to see a rise in opioid misuse, addiction and drug-related deaths.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also distribute complementary products such as JetStream Hot/Cold Therapy, Knee bracing, LSO Back bracing and Comfortrac and Saunders cervical and lumbar traction units, all products targeted at treating acute as well as chronic pain with minimal side-effects.

Key characteristics of our electrotherapy market are:

● | Collection cycles of initial payment from insurance carriers can range from less than 30 days to many months and considerably longer for many attorney, personal injury, and workers’ compensation cases. Such delayed payment impacts our cash flow and can slow our growth or strain our liquidity. Collections are also impacted by whether effective billing submissions are made by our billing and collections department to the third-party payers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prior to payment, third-party payers often make or take significant payment adjustments or discounts. This can also lead to denials and billing disputes with third-party payers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale of medical devices and from recurring patient supplies, specifically from our electrotherapy products sold through ZMI. We are reliant on third-party payer reimbursement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zynex Monitoring Solutions (ZMS):
ZMS is focused on developing products within the non-invasive multi-parameter patient-monitoring marketplace. ZMS is currently focusing on its fluid monitoring system, the sepsis monitor and the pulse oximetry products acquired in its acquisition of Kestrel. We believe our products, once released into the marketplace (of which there can be no guarantee), will compete against multiple competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited range of products. ZMS has not generated any revenue.
Competition
Since we are in the market for medical electrotherapy products, we face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Our principal competitors include International Rehabilitative Sciences, Inc. d/b/a RS Medical, EMSI, and H-Wave. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies. 
RESOURCES
Manufacturing and Product Assembly
Our manufacturing and product assembly strategy consists of the following elements:

● | Compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Use of contract manufacturers as needed, thereby allowing us to quickly respond to changes in volume and avoid large capital investments for assembly and manufacturing equipment of certain product components. We believe there is a large pool of highly qualified contract manufacturers, domestically and internationally, for the type of manufacturing assistance needed for our manufactured devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilization of in-house final assembly and test capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development of proprietary software and hardware for all products in house.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Testing all units in a real-life, in-house environment to help ensure the highest possible quality and patient safety while reducing the cost of warranty repairs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We utilize contract manufacturers located in the U.S. to manufacture components for our NexWave and NeuroMove units and for some of our other products and assemble in-house for our NexWave and NeuroMove units. We do not have long-term supply agreements with our contract manufacturers, but we utilize purchase orders with agreed upon terms for our ongoing needs. We believe there are numerous suppliers that can manufacture our products and provide our required raw materials. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of our required raw materials and components. We are always evaluating our suppliers for price, quality, delivery time and service. The reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our operations.
Intellectual Property
Zynex is committed to aggressively protecting the intellectual property rights the Company has worked so hard to obtain and to expand our intellectual property portfolio for advances to our existing products and for new products as they are developed.
Zynex has received two U.S. utility patents, as well as a utility patent in Europe, for our fluid monitoring system. The acquisition of Kestrel Labs, Inc. by Zynex Inc. included an intellectual property portfolio surrounding the acquired laser-based photoplethysmographic technology. This expands both the size and scope of Zynex’s intellectual property portfolio to include key aspects of the exciting pulse oximetry market.
Zynex is trademarked in the U.S.
We utilize non-disclosure and trade secret agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary information.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
All of our ZMI products are classified as Class II (Medium Risk) devices by the FDA, and clinical studies with our products are considered to be NSR (Non-Significant Risk Studies). Our business is regulated by the FDA, and all products typically require 510(k) market clearance before they can be put into commercial distribution. Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, is available in certain instances for Class II devices. It requires that before introducing most Class II devices into interstate commerce, the sponsor must first submit information to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to March 1976 or to devices that have been reclassified in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that do not require approval of a premarket approval application. When the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent, the agency issues a “clearance” letter that authorizes marketing of the product. We are also regulated by the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which sets forth current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements for devices. We believe that our products have obtained or are good candidates for the requisite FDA clearance or are exempt from the FDA clearance process. In November 2001, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market NeuroMove. In September 2011, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the NexWave, our current generation IFC, TENS and NMES device. In August 2012, Zynex received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the InWave, our next generation muscle stimulator for treatment of female incontinence. Failure to comply with FDA requirements could adversely affect us.
International
Zynex continues to explore opportunities to gain regulatory clearance for its devices in markets outside of the U.S.
CE marking is the medical device manufacturer’s claim that a product meets the essential requirements of all relevant European Medical Device Directives. The CE mark is a legal requirement to place a device on the market in the EU. Zynex is currently in the process of applying for CE marking on several of its electrotherapy devices and its CM-1500 Zynex Fluid Monitoring System.
We comply with applicable regulatory requirements within the markets in which we currently sell. If and when we decide to enter additional geographic areas, we intend to comply with applicable regulatory requirements within those markets.

Zynex has received ISO13485: 2016 certification for its compliance with international standards in quality management systems for design, development, manufacturing and distribution of medical devices. This certification is not only important as assurance that we have the appropriate quality systems in place but is also crucial to our international expansion efforts as many countries require this certification as part of their regulatory approval. 
Government Regulation
The delivery of health care services and products has become one of the most highly regulated professional and business endeavors in the United States. Both the federal government and individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of health care services and products. Federal law and regulations are based primarily upon the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Each program is financed, at least in part, with federal funds. State jurisdiction is based upon the state’s interest in regulating the quality of health care in the state, regardless of the source of payment. Many state and local jurisdictions impose additional legal and regulatory requirements on our business including various states and local licenses, taxes, limitations regarding insurance claim submission and limitations on relationships with referral parties. Failure to comply with this myriad of regulations in a particular jurisdiction may subject us to fines or other penalties, including the inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions.
Federal health care laws apply to us when we submit a claim to any other federally funded health care program, in addition to requirements to meet government standards. The principal federal laws that we must abide by in these situations include:

● | Those that prohibit the filing of false or improper claims for federal payment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Those that prohibit unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally funded health care programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The federal government may impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on anyone who files a false claim for reimbursement from federally funded programs.
A federal law commonly known as the “anti-kickback law” prohibits the knowing or willful solicitation, receipt, offer or payment of any remuneration made in return for:

● | The referral of patients covered under federally-funded health care programs; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for any goods, facility, items or service reimbursable under those programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Healthcare Regulation
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually

identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. 
In addition, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or the ACA, created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Research and Development
During 2022 and 2021, we incurred approximately $7.1 million and $2.6 million in expenses, respectively, related to our ZMS operations. During 2022, approximately $1.0 million of the expenses qualified for Section 174 - “Amortization of Research and Experimental Expenditures” tax treatment. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2023 as our ZMS business expands.
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 900 full time employees.
Our employees are our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. All of our employees contribute to our success and, in particular, our sales representatives are instrumental in our ability to reach more patients in pain.
The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in a competitive labor market, we have developed recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures form our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives:

● | Competitive pay and benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve superior results.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Training and development. We invest in learning opportunities that foster a growth mindset. Our formal offerings include a tuition reimbursement program, an e-learning program that all corporate employees have access to and in-house learning opportunities through the Company’s Zynex Growth and Development program.
