ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
Our solution, the Bloom Energy Server, is a stationary power generation platform built for the digital age and capable of delivering highly reliable, uninterrupted, 24x7 constant power that is also clean and sustainable. The Bloom Energy Server converts standard low-pressure natural gas or biogas into electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion, resulting in very high conversion efficiencies and lower harmful emissions than conventional fossil fuel generation. A typical configuration produces 250 kilowatts of power in a footprint roughly equivalent to that of half of a standard thirty-foot shipping container, or approximately 125 times more space-efficient than solar power generation. 250 kilowatts of power is roughly equivalent to the constant power requirement of a typical big box retail store. Any number of these Energy Server systems can be clustered together in various configurations to form solutions from hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts. 
Our team has decades of experience in the various specialized disciplines and systems engineering concepts embedded in this technology. We had 224 issued patents in the United States and 110 issued patents internationally as of December 31, 2018.
Our solution is capable of addressing customer needs across a wide range of industry verticals. The industries we currently serve consist of banking and financial services, cloud services, technology and data centers, communications and media, consumer packaged goods and consumables, education, government, healthcare, hospitality, logistics, manufacturing, real estate, retail and utilities.
Some of our largest customers are AT&T, Caltech, Delmarva Power & Light Company, Equinix, The Home Depot, Kaiser Permanente and The Wonderful Company. We also work actively with financing partners, such as Southern PowerSecure Holdings, Inc. (referred to as "The Southern Company"). These finance partners purchase our systems and deploy the systems at end-customers’ facilities in order to provide the electricity as a service. Our customer base included 25 of the Fortune 100 companies as of December 31, 2018.
Industry Background
According to Marketline, the market for electric power is one of the largest sectors of the global economy with total revenues of $2.4 trillion in 2016, and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.3% to $2.9 trillion in 2021. 
There are numerous challenges facing producers of electricity. We believe these challenges will be the foundation of a transformation in how electricity is produced, delivered and consumed. We believe this transformation will be similar to the seismic shifts seen in the computer and telecommunications industries - similar to its centralized mainframe computing and landline telephone systems' shift to the ubiquitous and highly personalized distributed technologies seen today. 
Increasing capital costs to maintain and operate the existing electric grid. The electric power grid has suffered from insufficient investment in critical infrastructure as a result of complexities surrounding the ownership, operation and regulation of grid infrastructure, compounded by the challenges of large capital costs and lack of adequate innovation. We believe that U.S. electric utilities will be required to make substantial capital expenditures simply to maintain the electrical grid infrastructure.
Inherent vulnerability of existing grid design. The existing electric grid architecture features centralized, monolithic power plants and mostly above-ground transmission and distribution wires. The limits of this design, coupled with aging and underinvested infrastructure, leaves the grid vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, wildfires, flooding and extreme temperature variations, which have increased in number and severity in recent years. This results in outages causing an annual loss to American businesses of as much as $150 billion with weather-related disruptions costing the most per event. 
In addition to potential disruptions to the grid, there is also an increasing concern over the threat of cyber-attack and physical sabotage to the centralized grid infrastructure.
Intermittent generation sources such as wind and solar are negatively impacting grid stability. As the penetration of wind and solar resources increases, balancing real-time supply and demand becomes more challenging and costly. Due to these challenges, solutions are needed that provide constant base load 24x7 electric power that is reliable, clean and without the shortcomings of the existing grid infrastructure or intermittent sources such as wind and solar. This need is especially acute in the commercial and industrial customer segments, which represent 68% of global electricity consumption, according to Marketline, where cost and reliability can have a direct impact on profitability and business sustainability.
Increasing focus on reducing harmful emissions. The electric power sector, which today produces more greenhouse gases than any other sector of the global economy, is under increasing pressure to do its part to reduce such emissions. Policy

initiatives to reduce harmful emissions from power generation are widespread, including the adoption of renewable portfolio standards or mandated targets for low- or zero-carbon power generation.
Lack of access to affordable and reliable electricity in developing countries. Building a centralized grid system, in addition to its inherent limitations, can also be infeasible in developing countries due to the lack of adequate capital for upfront investment. We believe these countries are likely to develop a hybrid solution consisting of both centralized and distributed electrical power infrastructure to accelerate the availability of power.
Our Solution
The Bloom Energy Server delivers reliable, resilient, clean and affordable energy, particularly in areas of high electricity costs, through its advanced distributed power generation system that is customizable, always-on and a source of primary base load power.
The Bloom Energy Server is based on our proprietary solid oxide fuel cell technology which converts fuel into electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion. The primary input to the system is standard low-pressure natural gas or biogas from local gas lines. The high-quality electrical output of the Energy Server is connected to the customer’s main electrical feed thereby avoiding the transmission and distribution losses associated with a centralized grid system. Each Bloom Energy Server is modular and composed of independent 50-kilowatt power modules. A typical configuration includes multiple power modules in a single Energy Server and can produce 250 kilowatts of power in a footprint roughly equivalent to that of half a standard 30 foot shipping container, or approximately 125 times more space-efficient than solar power generation. Any number of these Energy Server systems can be clustered together in various configurations to form solutions from hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts. The Bloom Energy Server is easily integrated into corporate environments due to its aesthetically attractive design, compact space requirement, and minimal noise profile.
Our Value Proposition
Our value proposition has five key elements which allow us to deliver a better electron: reliability, resiliency, cost savings and predictability, sustainability and personalization. We provide a complete, integrated “behind-the-meter” solution including installation, equipment, service, maintenance and, in some cases, bundled fuel. The five elements of our value proposition emphasize those areas where there is a strong customer need and where we believe we can deliver superior performance.
Reliability. Our Energy Servers deliver always-on, 24x7 base load power with very high availability of power, mission-critical reliability and grid-independent capabilities. The Bloom Energy Server can be configured to eliminate the need for traditional backup power equipment such as diesel generators, batteries and uninterruptible power systems (UPS).
Resiliency. Our Energy Servers avoid the vulnerabilities of conventional transmission and distribution lines by generating power on-site where the electricity is consumed. The system operates at very high availability due to its modular and fault-tolerant design which includes multiple independent power generation modules that can be hot-swapped. Importantly, our systems utilize the existing natural gas infrastructure which is a redundant underground mesh network.
Cost Savings and Predictability. In contrast to the rising and unpredictable cost outlook for grid electricity, we offer our customers the ability to lock in cost for electric power (other than the price of natural gas) over the long-term. In the regions where the majority of our Energy Servers are deployed, our solution typically provides a lower cost of electricity to our customers than traditional grid power. In addition, our solution provides greater cost predictability versus rising grid prices. Moreover, we provide customers with a solution that includes all of the fixed equipment and maintenance costs for the life of the contract. 
Sustainability. Bloom Energy Servers provide clean power and, because they are fuel-flexible, customers can choose the fuel source that best fits their needs based on availability, cost and carbon footprint. Bloom Energy Servers deployed since 2012 running on natural gas produce nearly 60% less carbon emissions compared to the average of U.S. combustion power generation. Bloom Energy Servers can also utilize renewable biogas to generate carbon-neutral electricity. In both cases, our Energy Servers emit virtually no criteria air pollutants, including NOx or SOx. Bloom Energy Servers also use virtually no water during normal operation.
Personalization. The Bloom Energy Server is designed as a platform which can be customized to the needs of each customer to deliver the level of reliability, resiliency, sustainability, and cost predictability. For example, the Energy Server can be enhanced with uninterruptible power components to deliver higher levels of reliability and grid independent operation, and storage can be added to reduce peak power consumption and improve the predictability of economics for the customer.

We currently have installations in eleven states in the United States (California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah and Virginia) as well as in Japan, India and the Republic of Korea.
Technology
The fuel cells in our Energy Servers convert fuel, such as natural gas or biogas, into electricity through an electrochemical reaction without burning the fuel. Each individual fuel cell is composed of three layers: an electrolyte sandwiched between a cathode and an anode. The electrolyte is a solid ceramic material, and the anode and cathode are made from inks that coat the electrolyte. Unlike other types of fuel cells, no precious metals, corrosive acids or molten materials are required. These fuel cells are the foundational building block of the Bloom Energy Server. We combine a number of the fuel cells into a stack, and then combine a number of the stacks to form 50 kilowatt power modules (depending upon the generation required by the customer). Any number of these Energy Server systems can be arranged in various configurations to form solutions from hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts. Regardless of the starting size of a solution, further scaling can be accomplished after the initial solution deployment, creating on-going flexibility and scalability for the customer.
In a basic configuration, the Bloom Energy Server is interconnected to the customer’s electric grid connection. By regulation, the Bloom Energy Server must stop exporting power in case of a grid outage. However, Energy Servers can be upgraded with uninterruptable power solutions as add-on options at any point in time to enable continuous operation in the event of grid interruption. When in an uninterruptable configuration, the Energy Server continually powers critical loads while the grid serves as a backup. Should there be a disruption to grid power, the critical load, which is already receiving primary power from the Energy Server, experiences no disruption. The combination of primary power from the Energy Server, utilizing the natural gas infrastructure, and secondary feed from the independent electric grid results in a very highly available and reliable solution.
Competition
We primarily compete against the utility grid based on superior reliability, resiliency, cost savings, predictability and sustainability, all of which can be customized to the needs of individual customers. The customer has no single alternative solution that provides all of these important attributes in one platform. As we are able to drive our costs down, we expect our economic value proposition to continue to improve relative to grid power in additional markets.
Other sources of competition include:

• | Intermittent solar power. Solar power is intermittent and best suited for addressing peak power requirements, while Bloom provides stable base load generation. Storage technology is intended to address the intermittency of solar, but the low power density and efficiency of solar technology makes the combined solution impractical for most C&I customers. As a point of comparison, our Energy Servers provide the same power output in 1/125th of the footprint of solar, allowing us to serve far more of a customer’s energy requirements based on a customer’s available space.


• | Intermittent wind power. Power from wind turbines is intermittent, similar to solar power. Typically wind power is deployed for utility-side, grid-scale applications in remote locations but not as a customer-side, distributed power alternative due to prohibitive space requirements and permitting issues. Remote wind farms feeding into the grid are dependent upon the vulnerable transmission and distribution infrastructure to transport power to the point of consumption.


• | Traditional co-generation systems. These systems deliver a combination of electric power and heat. We believe that we compete favorably because of our superior electrical efficiencies, significantly less complex deployment (avoiding heating systems integration), better performance on emissions and noise, superior availability, aesthetic appeal and reliability.


• | Traditional backup equipment. As our Energy Servers deliver always-on power, they can obviate the need for traditional backup equipment such as diesel generators. We generally compete by offering a better integrated, more reliable and cost-effective solution versus these grid-plus-backup systems.


• | Other commercially available fuel cells. Basic fuel cell technology is over 100 years old. The Bloom Energy Server uses advanced solid oxide fuel cell technology which produces electricity directly from oxidizing a fuel. The solid oxide fuel cell has a solid oxide or ceramic electrolyte. The advantages of this technology include high efficiency, long-term stability, elimination of the need for an external fuel reformer, ability to use biogas or natural gas as a fuel, low emissions and relatively low cost. There are a variety of fuel cell technologies, characterized by their electrolyte material, including:

◦ | Proton exchange membrane fuel cells ("PEM"). PEM fuel cells typically are used in on-board transportation applications, such as powering forklifts, because of their compactness and ability for quick starts and stops. However, PEM technology requires an expensive platinum catalyst which is susceptible to poisoning by trace amounts of impurities in the fuel or exhaust products. These fuel cells require hydrogen as an input source of energy or an external fuel reformer, which adds to the cost, complexity and electrical inefficiency of the product. As a result, they are not an economically viable option for stationary base load power generation.


◦ | Molten carbonate fuel cells ("MCFC"). MCFCs are high-temperature fuel cells that use an electrolyte composed of a molten carbonate salt mixture suspended in a porous, chemically inert ceramic matrix of beta-alumina solid electrolyte. The primary disadvantages of current MCFC technology are durability and lower electrical efficiency compared to solid oxide fuel cells. Current versions of the product are built for 300 kilowatts, and they are monolithic. Smaller sizes are not economically viable. In many applications where the heat produced by these fuel cells is not useable continuously, getting rid of the heat also becomes a liability.


◦ | Phosphoric acid fuel cells ("PAFC"). PAFCs are a type of fuel cell that uses liquid phosphoric acid as an electrolyte. Developed in the mid-1960s and field-tested since the 1970s, they were the first fuel cells to be commercialized. PAFCs have been used for stationary power generators with output in the 100 kilowatt to 400 kilowatt range. PAFCs are best suited to combined heat and power applications which require carefully matching power and heat requirements, often making the technology difficult to implement. Further disadvantages include low power density and stability.

Manufacturing Facilities
Our primary manufacturing locations for the fuel cells and Energy Servers assembly are in Newark, Delaware and Sunnyvale, California. The 225,700 square foot manufacturing facility that we own in Newark is the first purpose-built Bloom Energy manufacturing center and was designed specifically for copy-exact duplication as we expand, which we believe will help us scale more efficiently. Additionally, we lease various manufacturing facilities in Sunnyvale and Mountain View, California. Our current leases for our Sunnyvale manufacturing facilities, entered into in April 2005, expires in 2020, and for our manufacturing facility in Mountain View, entered into in December 2011, expires in December 2020. Our California facilities comprise approximately 487,228 square feet of manufacturing space.
We believe our current manufacturing facilities are adequate to support our business for the next few years. Our Newark facility includes an additional 50 acres available for factory expansion and/or the co-location of supplier plants. Both of our two principal manufacturing facilities are powered by Bloom Energy Servers.
Supply Chain
Our Company's supply chain has been developed, since the beginning of the company, with a group of high quality suppliers that support automotive, semiconductor and other traditional manufacturing organizations. Many of the components that they produce for us are customized and have long lead time components. We have been working to mitigate these long lead times by developing second sources and have developed an active business continuity program. We also purchase long lead items, along with suppliers, to assure component supply for continuity. 
Services
We offer operations and maintenance services agreements for our Energy Servers which are renewable at the election of the customer on an annual basis. The customer agrees to pay an on-going service fee and in return Bloom monitors, maintains and operates the systems on the customer's behalf.
Our in-house service organization had 108 dedicated field service personnel in 16 locations as of December 31, 2018. Standard customer contracts include service covering all on-going system operation, maintenance - including periodic refresh of power modules - and 24x7 remote monitoring and control.
Each Bloom Energy Server includes a secure connection to redundant Remote Monitoring and Control Center ("RMCC") facilities that are geographically well separated. There are two RMCC facilities which provide constant monitoring of over 500 system performance parameters and predictive factors. Using proprietary, internally developed software, the RMCC operators can optimize fleet performance remotely from either RMCC facility. As needed, operators can dispatch field services to the site to locally restore and enhance performance. The RMCC facilities communicate through a secure network and can operate together or independently to provide full services for the fleet.
We currently service and maintain all of our Energy Servers.

Customer Financing
We assist our customers by providing innovative financing options which, in addition to aiding in customer purchase, provides us an expanded addressable customer base. We have developed multiple options for our customers to acquire the power our Energy Servers produce. These offerings provide a range of options that include the purchase of our systems outright with operations and maintenance services contracts, or the purchase of electricity that our Energy Servers produce without any upfront costs through various financing vehicles including leases and power purchase agreements ("PPAs") that combine the cost of our systems, warranty and service, financing, and in some cases fuel into monthly payments based on the electricity produced.
Our largest PPA financing partner, through our Third-Party PPA Program, is the Southern Company, one of the largest utility companies in the United States. Other project financing partners include Key Bank, Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse, Constellation Energy (a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation) and WGL Energy. 
Sales, Marketing and Partnerships
We market our Energy Servers primarily through a single direct sales organization supported by project finance, business development, government affairs and marketing teams. In addition to our internal resources, we work with multiple partners to generate customer leads and develop projects. Most recently, we announced our first distributorship agreement with SK Group. Pursuant to this agreement, SK Engineering and Construction will become a distributor of Bloom Energy Servers oxide fuel cell systems in the Republic of Korea.
Sustainability
Bloom systems reduce carbon emissions and save water compared to traditional power generation systems. Thus, our primary sustainability goal is to maximize sales of Bloom systems and provide the longest and most economically sustainable life cycle possible for the Bloom fuel cells through reliability enhancement programs.
We seek to minimize our environmental footprint with research and development initiatives designed to extend system operating life while reducing consumption of new material in our Energy Servers. We have an end-to-end recycling approach to recover components from end-of-life units for reuse or recycling and we have dedicated facilities in our manufacturing locations in Delaware and California to inspect and dismantle components removed during scheduled maintenance. We have an audit program to identify improvement opportunities at suppliers and also work to reduce their one-way packaging to minimize materials going to landfills.
These strategies in combination provide a robust and comprehensive sustainability strategy that looks both externally on impact on the wider environment and internally on responsible design, materials management and recycling.
Permits and Approvals
Each Bloom Energy installation must be designed, constructed and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, international and local regulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies and laws. To install and operate our systems, we, our customers and our partners are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from local authorities for the installation of Bloom Energy Servers and for the interconnection systems with the local electrical utility.
Government Policies and Incentives
There are varying policy frameworks across the United States and abroad designed to support and accelerate the adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed generation technologies such as Bloom Energy Servers. These policy initiatives come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives and/or specific gas or electric tariffs.
The U.S. federal government provides businesses with a 30% Investment Tax Credit ("ITC") under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, available to the owner of our Energy Server for systems purchased and placed into service. The credit is equal to 30% of expenditures for capital equipment and installation and the credit for fuel cells is capped at $1,500 per 0.5 kilowatt of capacity. This federal tax benefit expired on December 31, 2016 but was reinstated on February 9, 2018. For more information on the ITC, please see ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Our Energy Servers are currently installed at customer sites in eleven states in the United States, each of which has its own enabling policy framework. Some states have utility procurement programs and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Our Energy Servers currently qualify for tax exemptions, incentives or other customer incentives in many states including the states of California, New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. These policy provisions are subject to change.

Although we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, international and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. Federal, state, international and local governments continuously modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity.
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection agreements from the applicable local primary electricity and gas utilities. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required once interconnection agreements are signed.
Product safety standards for stationary fuel cell generators have been established by the American National Standards Institute ("ANSI"). These standards are known as ANSI/CSA “FC-1”. Our products are designed to meet this standard. Further, we utilize UL to certify compliance with the standard. Energy Server installation guidance is provided by NFPA 853: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Fuel Cell Power Systems. Installations at sites are carried out to meet the requirements of this standard.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings or subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we are not currently party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. For a discussion of legal proceedings, see "Legal Matters" under Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,524 employees and contractors. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Corporate Facilities
Our corporate headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 4353 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95134, and our telephone number is (408) 543-1500. We entered into the lease for our new corporate headquarters, consisting of 181,000 square feet of multi-floor office space, which commenced in January 2019 and expires in December 2028. Our headquarters is used for administration, research and development, and sales and marketing.
We lease additional office space as field offices in the United States and around the world including in India, the Republic of Korea, China and Taiwan. We believe our office space is adequate to support our business for at least the next twelve months.
