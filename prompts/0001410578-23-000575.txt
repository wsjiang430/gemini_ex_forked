ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Organizational Development
Petros was organized as a Delaware corporation on May 14, 2020 for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 17, 2020 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and between Petros, Neurotrope, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Neurotrope”), PM Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 1”), PN Merger Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (“Merger Sub 2”), and Metuchen Pharmaceuticals LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Metuchen”). The Merger Agreement provided for (1) the merger of Merger Sub 1, with and into Metuchen, with Metuchen surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (the “Metuchen Merger”) and (2) the merger of Merger Sub 2 with and into Neurotrope, with Neurotrope surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petros (the “Neurotrope Merger” and together with the Metuchen Merger, the “Mergers”). As a result of the Mergers, Metuchen and Neurotrope became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Petros, and Petros became a publicly traded corporation on December 1, 2020.
On December 7, 2020, Neurotrope completed the spin-off of certain assets, whereby (i) any cash in excess of $20,000,000, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement, and all of the operating assets and liabilities of Neurotrope not retained by Neurotrope in connection with the Mergers were contributed to Synaptogenix, Inc. (formerly known as Neurotrope Bioscience, Inc. and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Neurotrope prior to the spin-off), a Delaware corporation (“Synaptogenix”) and (ii) holders of record of Neurotrope common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, Neurotrope preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share and certain warrants as of November 30, 2020 received a pro rata distribution of common stock of Synaptogenix, resulting in a separate, independent publicly traded company.
Business Model and Primary Marketed Products
Petros is a pharmaceutical company focused on men’s health therapeutics with a full range of commercial capabilities including sales, marketing, regulatory and medical affairs, finance, trade relations, pharmacovigilance, market access relations, manufacturing, and distribution.
Petros consists of wholly owned subsidiaries, Metuchen, Neurotrope, Timm Medical Technologies, Inc. (“Timm Medical”), and Pos-T-Vac, LLC (“PTV”). We are engaged in the commercialization and development of Stendra®, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved PDE-5 inhibitor prescription medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (“ED”), which we have licensed from Vivus, Inc. (“Vivus”). Petros also markets its own line of ED products in the form of vacuum erection device products through its subsidiaries, Timm Medical and PTV. In addition to ED products, we have acquired an exclusive global license (the “Hybrid License”) to develop and commercialize H100™, a novel and patented topical formulation candidate for the treatment of acute Peyronie’s disease.
Stendra®
Stendra® is an FDA approved PDE-5 inhibitor prescription medication for the treatment of ED and is the only patent protected PDE-5 inhibitor on the market. As a distinct molecule with high in-vitro affinity and selectivity for penile tissue (clinical significance of this in-vitro selectivity profile is unknown), Stendra® offers the ED therapeutic landscape a valuable addition as an oral ED therapy that may be taken once daily as early as approximately 15 minutes prior to sexual engagement, with or without food when using the 100mg or 200mg dosing (does not apply to 50mg dosing) , subject to certain contraindications and limitations common among PDE-5 inhibitors. For example, Stendra® is contraindicated for, and may cause hypotension when used by, individuals who take medicines called “nitrates,” alpha-blockers, or other antihypertensives or who have consumed a substantial amount of alcohol (e.g., more than three glasses of wine or three shots of whiskey).

On September 30, 2016, we acquired from Vivus all of the rights to license, develop, market, sell, and distribute the drug avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) in the United States, Canada, South America, and India, including all assets related to, or necessary for, the exercise of such rights, such as licenses, trademarks, and intellectual property rights. The drug avanafil was initially developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”) and MTPC licensed the rights to avanafil to Vivus in December 2000 (the “MPTC License”). Stendra® (avanafil) was approved by the FDA in April 2012. Petros seeks to make Stendra® the first oral ED prescription therapy available as a (nonprescription) over-the-counter (“OTC”) option in the United States (referred to as an “Rx-to-OTC switch”). To that end, Petros has developed a Stendra® Drug Facts Label (DFL) and completed two label comprehension studies (which are non-clinical consumer studies intended to assess whether consumers understand key elements of an OTC drug label, namely instructions for use, contraindications, in-use warnings, and precautions), announcing the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 in July and December 2021, respectively. Petros also announced the initiation of two “self-selection” studies in January 2022 one of which includes participants from the general population and the other is specific to nitrate-medicine users (a patient group of particular interest to the FDA). In these self-selection studies, individuals who are interested in utilizing an OTC ED product are recruited to review the draft OTC labeling for Stendra® and determine whether the product is, or is not, appropriate for them to use without the intervention of a healthcare professional. Petros has shared pertinent data from these activities with the FDA in a pre-IND meeting that Petros held as a written response engagement during the first half of 2022. Accordingly, Petros intends to collect and implement FDA feedback to optimize the Stendra® DFL, launch a second pivotal Label Comprehension Study and prepare to share these results in a subsequent engagement with FDA. We also plan to pursue guidance to inform the next phase of Self Selection Studies we intend to conduct to gather further data that we hope will support our Rx-to-OTC switch. Additionally, on June 28, 2022, FDA published a proposed rule entitled, Nonprescription Drug Product With an Additional Condition for Non-prescription Use or ACNU, which, if finalized, would establish requirements for certain OTC drug products for which FDA has determined additional measures must be implemented to ensure appropriate self-selection and/or appropriate actual use by consumers without the supervision of a healthcare practitioner. While Petros believes this proposed rule indicates FDA’s intent to increase OTC drug availability, it may also create additional challenges in connection with an Rx-to-OTC switch. Accordingly, Petros will continue to explore and align with the FDA, and make necessary updates to its current development plans and activities for Stendra, in anticipation of FDA’s enactment of the Final ACNU Rule anticipated for late 2023.
Vacuum Erection Devices (“VEDs”)
Petros also markets its own line of medical devices intended for ED treatment through its subsidiaries, Timm Medical and PTV, including the VED systems marketed as the “Osbon ErecAid” and “PosTVac.”. We plan to continue to grow the VED business both domestically and internationally. Petros believes that its potential growth will come through the expansion of its distribution partner network, which currently includes several national and international distributors as well as a growing number of regional small-business distributors specialized in the urology landscape. Additionally, Petros intends to continue to leverage existing relationships with key clinician decision makers, offering direct purchase agreements for Centers of Excellence in prostate cancer and sexual health rehabilitation. This will allow for increased local purchase availability for consumers. We believe that potential international growth will come through additional work with existing customers to expand our current base of business while also working to unlock new international territories. In addition to expanding the distribution network, Petros is pursuing better use of the historical clinical data available regarding VEDs.
H100™
In addition to its ED products, Petros is committed to identifying and developing other pharmaceuticals to advance men’s health. In March 2020, the Company acquired the Hybrid License, providing an exclusive license to H100™. H100™ is a topical candidate with at least one active ingredient and potentially a combination of ingredients that we believe responsible for the improvement of penile curvature during the acute phase of Peyronie’s disease. We paid an initial license fee of $100,000 and an additional payment of $250,000, and additional annual milestone payments of $125,000, $150,000 and $200,000 are due on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the license agreement and $250,000 annual payments due thereafter. The Company is also required to make a $1,000,000 payment upon first commercial sale and a sliding scale of percentage payments on net sales in the low single digits. Annual anniversary payments will not be required after commercialization. The Company is also obligated to make royalty payments between 3 and 6% of any net sales.
On September 24, 2020, the Company and Hybrid entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which the term of the Hybrid License was extended for an additional six months to March 24, 2021. In consideration for the extension, the Company paid Hybrid $50,000 in October 2020 and an additional $100,000 in December 2020. On March 31, 2021, the Company and Hybrid, entered into a second letter 

2



agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to extend the Second Period (as defined in the Hybrid License) for an additional six (6) months to September 24, 2021. Additionally, the Company agreed to pay Hybrid a one-time, non-creditable and non-refundable payment of two hundred thousand U.S. Dollars ($200,000), which was paid within seven calendar days of entering into the second letter agreement. On September 24, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the license agreement in which the Company exercised its right not to terminate the Hybrid License even though orphan drug status had not yet been granted by the FDA. Along with this election, the Company paid Hybrid $150,000 on October 1, 2021, $200,000 on October 31, 2021, $200,000 on December 1, 2021, $200,000 on December 23, 2021 and $150,000 on March 24, 2022.
While the Company’s primary priority remains the Stendra® Rx-to-OTC switch, we expect to incur approximately $14 million of research and development expenses relating to H100™ over the estimated four to six-year period of clinical development prior to FDA approval (if granted), including approximately $10 million for clinical trials and $4 million of other expenses. The Company anticipates funding these future expenses through additional capital raises, awarded grants or issuance of debt, until revenues become sufficient to cover these ongoing expenses.
Petros has established its foundation for growth and, with the addition of H100™ to the product portfolio and other pipeline opportunities for additional products, Petros believes that it can build an industry leading men’s health pharmaceutical company. Petros has no other product candidates and no other definitive license agreements at this time. However, Petros is engaged in discussions with viable, late-stage therapeutic assets addressing male hormone replacement therapy, male infertility, BPH and prostate cancer, but has not entered into any binding agreements with respect thereto.
Manufacturing and Supply
Petros currently only has facilities to assemble its VED products, and therefore must rely on qualified third-party contract manufacturers with appropriate facilities and equipment to contract manufacture commercial quantities of its products. If, for any reason, Petros’ contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, it may be required to replace them. Although Petros believes there are a number of potential replacements, it may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacements.
Petros obtains from third parties the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture its products, including the active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in its products. Until recently, Petros has relied on Vivus to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) necessary for the manufacture of Stendra® pursuant to a commercial supply agreement executed on September 30, 2016 (the “Vivus Supply Agreement”), which required Petros to purchase certain minimum quantities of Stendra® in each year of the Vivus Supply Agreement term. The Vivus Supply Agreement was terminated by Petros effective September 30, 2021. On January 18, 2022, Petros (through its wholly-owned subsidiary) and Vivus entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Vivus Settlement Agreement”) related to the minimum purchase requirements under the Vivus Supply Agreement in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and certain reimbursement rights asserted by a third-party retailer in connection with quantities of the Company’s Stendra® product that were delivered to the third-party retailer and later returned. In connection with the Vivus Settlement Agreement, Petros retained approximately $7.3 million of API inventory (representing the 2018 and 2019 minimum purchase requirements) out of approximately $12.4 million due under the Vivus Supply Agreement, in conjunction with forgiveness of approximately $4.25 million of current liabilities relating to returned goods and minimum purchase commitments. In exchange for the API and reduction of current liabilities, Petros executed an interest-bearing promissory note in favor of Vivus in the principal amount of $10,201,758 (the “Note”). The parties also entered into a Security Agreement to secure Petros’ obligations under the promissory note. The Company recorded the impact of this transaction, including the gain in the first quarter of 2022.
In addition to the payments to be made in accordance with the Note, the Company further agreed in the Vivus Settlement Agreement to (i) grant to Vivus a right of first refusal to provide certain types of debt and convertible equity (but not preferred equity) financing issued by or to Metuchen (including any subsidiaries and intermediaries) until the Note is paid in full, and (ii) undertake to make certain regulatory submissions to effectuate Vivus’ ability to exercise its rights under the License Agreement. On January 18, 2022, the Company made a prepayment of the obligations under the Note in the amount of $900,000, and a payment of $1,542,904 with respect to a purchase order made in 2021 to Vivus. In consideration of these payments and upon the Company’s satisfaction of certain regulatory submissions Vivus released 50% of the quantity of bulk Stendra® tablets under the Company’s existing open purchase order (the “Open Purchase Order”) being held by Vivus, which represents approximately a six-month supply of inventory. Pursuant to the Vivus Settlement Agreement Vivus also released the remaining 50% of the quantity of bulk Stendra® tablets under the Open Purchase Order later in the first quarter of 2022 upon the Company’s satisfaction of the remaining regulatory submission requirements. The Vivus 

3



Settlement Agreement stipulated that Vivus is the sole owner of all API unless or until such time as certain quantities of API are shipped to the Company upon the fulfillment of the aforementioned payment conditions.
Following the termination of the Vivus Supply Agreement, Petros, through its subsidiary Metuchen, entered into a Technology Transfer Service Agreement on January 20, 2022, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc., part of Thermo Fisher Scientific (“Patheon”), pursuant to which the Company and Patheon agreed to collaborate as strategic partners for commercial production of Stendra® tablets at Patheon’s facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. Under the Agreement, Patheon or one of its affiliates will provide pharmaceutical development and technology transfer services in order to establish and validate its ability to manufacture supply of the Company’s Stendra® product. Any commercial sale of product manufactured during the performance of the Agreement must be subject to a subsequent commercial manufacturing services agreement (with associated quality agreement) between the parties before it can be offered for commercial sale.
Petros is required to identify the supplier of all the raw materials for all FDA-approved products that it acquires from others. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, Petros would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA and depending on the supplier, provide the FDA with notice or receive FDA approval for the supplier, which would likely delay or interrupt manufacturing of the affected product.
Distribution and Marketing
Petros has distribution agreements with the three largest pharmaceutical distributors (McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”), Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”), and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”)), as well as a direct purchase program for designated retail dispensing pharmacies within large urology group practices, enabling us to provide Stendra® to customers through most retail pharmacies in the United States. Petros currently depends on McKesson to service these pharmaceutical distribution agreements. McKesson, on an exclusive basis, provides distribution of Stendra® to its own retail pharmacies and handles Petros’ distribution to Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen.
In addition to established nationwide distribution mechanisms, Petros also collaborates with several commercial insurance entities with contracted access to Stendra® and enduring capabilities to expand these commercial insurance relationships for future assets. Although commercial insurance collaboration and contracts remain an important factor in patient access and affordability, Medicare and Medicaid remain largely out of scope for Stendra® and most sexual dysfunction therapies. As with many sexual dysfunction therapeutics, Medicare and Medicaid do not normally contract or reimburse for these therapies unless concomitantly indicated for other ailments beyond sexual dysfunction considered medically necessary. Nevertheless, commercial insurance access remains competitive and widely available for Stendra®.
Petros relies on a variety of channels to market and sell its products, including:

● | third-party contracted sales representatives who promote Stendra® directly to high-volume physician prescribers of ED therapies and target physicians at trade associations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | online digital strategies, including search engine optimization and targeted advertisements, target physicians and consumers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | targeting of managed care organizations to deliver value-based contracts and improve placement for Stendra® on approved drug lists;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | collaboration with specialty pharmacies that provide personalized service to physicians and patients, including discreet shipping to patients’ homes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | direct marketing of our medical devices to urology offices domestically and internationally.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
We depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of, or a significant shortfall in demand from, these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2022, four customers accounted for approximately 80% of our consolidated gross sales, and four collectively accounted 

4



for approximately 92% of Stendra® gross sales. For further information, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
According to data provided by IQVIA, the oral ED market (specifically the PDE-5 inhibitor class) has experienced significant growth over the last couple of years. Future market estimates continue to reflect similar growth trends. As generic options have become available, such as sildenafil (generic Viagra) and tadalafil (generic Cialis), they have led the growth in prescription volume including a limited yet enduring presence of branded prescription volume, indicating durable brand loyalty and value. Stendra® remains the only patent protected brand among the PDE-5 inhibitor class. According to Arizton Advisory and Intelligence Erectile Dysfunction Market Reports, the trajectory of growth in this class is projected to continue to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 7.1% through 2028. We expect that North America will remain the lead market in this growth due to its established healthcare landscape and the prominence of comorbid conditions associated with ED. With an estimated 75% of the 30 million men suffering from ED in the US, ED prescription naive, we believe expanded access, in both cost and unhindered direct access, will mobilize the treatment naive as well as the experienced patients.
Employees
Our Board of Directors oversees our employee relations programs as it views building our culture – from employee development and retention to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives as key to driving long-term value for our business and helping to mitigate risks.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 24 full time employees, all of whom were based inside the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Government Regulation
Pharmaceutical products and medical devices, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products and product candidates.
Regulation in the United States
Drug Development and Approval Process
To obtain approval of a new drug product from the FDA, sponsors must, among other requirements, submit extensive data supporting its safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the drug and proposed product labeling and packaging. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and sponsors may encounter significant difficulties or costs in their efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude them from marketing their developed drug candidates.
The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves some or all of the following key steps:

● | completion of nonclinical studies, such as laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, performed in compliance with FDA regulations for good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and its submission to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




● | submission of an NDA to the FDA along with payment of the application user fee and FDA acceptance of that NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) in order to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | possible inspection of selected clinical study sites to confirm compliance with GCP requirements and data integrity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, if applicable, which must occur prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stendra® was approved via a traditional NDA in April 2012 for prescription-only use in treating ED. The approved NDA contains numerous contraindications, warnings, and risks, as well as instruction regarding when to seek help from a healthcare professional, among other things. In connection with our OTC strategy, we have over three years invested in the program and several key studies completed, including a pre-IND engagement with FDA in mid-2022. Current regulatory landscape for Over the Counter (OTC) approval of a prescription pharmaceutical presents several possible applications, with some options posed to industry as proposed rules (pending formal approval into policy) by FDA. Options that may pertain to Stendra® OTC application for approval may include an SNDA, a new NDA for OTC and/or a Drug-Device application. In any application, the development of the Drug Facts Label, proven consumer comprehension, and demonstrated acceptable and appropriate consumer self-selection as well as safe and appropriate actual use in an OTC or non-prescription setting, remain paramount to the pathway to approval. Petros has, and intends to continue to, self-fund their OTC initiative.
Petros also currently plans to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA for H100™ for treatment of Peyronie’s disease, which will allow Petros to rely, in part, on published scientific literature and/or the FDA’s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of certain approved drug products. If the FDA disagrees with the appropriateness of reliance on a reference listed drug or published literature or if Petros is not otherwise able to bridge to the reference listed drug or published literature, it may need to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies, which could lead to unanticipated costs and delays or to the termination of the development program. If Petros is unable to obtain approval for H100™ through the 505(b)(2) NDA process, it may be required to pursue the traditional NDA process, which is more expensive and time consuming.
Post-Approval Requirements for Prescription Drugs
Following approval of a new drug product, the sponsor and the product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, and promotion and advertising requirements.
Promotional communications must be carefully crafted to ensure compliance with all applicable FDA regulations pertaining to prescription-drug marketing and labeling. In particular, prescription-drug advertisements must generally (1) not be false or misleading, (2) present a “fair balance” of information describing both the risks and benefits associated with the drug, (3) include facts that are “material” to the product’s advertised uses, and (4) include a “brief summary” that mentions every risk described in the product’s labeling. Further, where the intended use of a prescription drug differs from the intended use approved by FDA, as listed in the product’s approved NDA, FDA has asserted that the product is an unapproved “new drug” and taken enforcement action against sponsors for introducing such unapproved new drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the FDCA. This prohibited practice is also called “off-label” promotion. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, sponsors may not legally market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and 

6



are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved drug product. Accordingly, both sponsors and manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort on systems relating to production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance, and to ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements the FDCA.
The FDA may withdraw its approval for a drug product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or unexpected problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or the imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS.
Petros and/or its present or future suppliers, contract manufacturers, and/or other affiliates involved in one or more of its U.S. commercialization activities may not be able to comply with all FDA regulatory requirements. For example, Petros may believe that its manufacturing operations (including that of its contractors, as applicable) are fully compliant with cGMPs or that all promotional communications disseminated by or on behalf of Petros are consistent with FDA’s prescription-drug marketing requirements, but the FDA may determine otherwise. Petros could be subject to a number of adverse enforcement actions and/or penalties in connection with any failure(s) to comply with the FDCA and/or its implementing regulations, including, but not limited to, the following:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of approved products, market withdrawal, recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, untitled letters, public warnings, consumer advisories, “dear doctor” letters, and other similar publications or issuances;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | seizure, detention, import alerts;
--+-----------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes Class I, Class II or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, unless exempt. A Class III product is a product which has a new intended use or uses advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Petros’ current medical devices are classified Class II medical devices.
When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either: a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device 

7



Amendments of 1976 were enacted, and for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the United States. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained.
The FDA classifies Petros’ VEDs as Class II external penile rigidity devices, which, as of 2004, are exempt from the 510(k)-notification process, as long as all detailed special controls FDA has established for this product category are met. Petros’ VEDs, on the other hand, were introduced into the U.S. market pursuant to the 510(k) notification process before the FDA established the 510(k) exemption for external penile rigidity devices that meet applicable special controls. Accordingly, Petros’ VEDs may be lawfully marketed in accordance with their respective 510(k) summaries, rather than the special controls currently in-place for external penile rigidity devices marketed without 510(k) clearance. However, to the extent any modifications are made or the VEDs are marketed beyond the scope of their respective 510(k) summaries, they must comply with the applicable special controls.
Post-Market Requirements for Medical Devices
Numerous post-market regulatory requirements apply to medical devices, including, but not limited to:

● | the QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared or PMA-approved devices that could affect safety or effectiveness;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | advertising and promotion requirements;

The manufacturing of Petros’ VEDs must comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Further, Petros’ records and manufacturing processes (and/or the records and manufacturing processes of the subsidiaries through which the VEDs are marketed) are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Any failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, the VED-manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of the VEDs.

Regulation of Third-Party Contract Manufacturers
Third-party contract manufacturers that Petros relies on to manufacture commercial quantities of its products are also subject to cGMPs and/or the FDA’s QSR regulations, which impose extensive procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies perform ongoing periodic unannounced inspections to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs/QSR and other applicable government regulations. Prior to approving a marketing application, manufacturers will also need to validate their manufacturing process. The FDA will also inspect the proposed manufacturing facilities to confirm that they can produce products meeting the FDA’s regulatory standards.
Intellectual Property
Petros relies on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Petros’ rights to market, distribute and sell avanafil (the active ingredient in Stendra®) are granted under a License and Commercialization Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Vivus entered into on September 30, 2016, which is a sublicense under Vivus’ license agreement with the owner of the Stendra® patent, MTPC (the “MTPC License”). The MTPC License contains certain termination rights that would allow MTPC to terminate the agreement if Vivus were to breach any of the terms of the MTPC License or become insolvent or bankrupt. In the event that MTPC terminates the MTPC License with Vivus because of any contractual breach, Petros has step-in rights with MTPC, which would allow Petros to continue to sell Stendra®. In March 2020, the Company acquired the Hybrid License, providing an exclusive license to H100™. H100™ is a topical candidate with at least one active ingredient and potentially a combination of ingredients responsible for the improvement of penile curvature during the acute phase of Peyronie’s disease. The Hybrid License relates to three US patents and two European patents directed to the formulation and use of H100™ in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. U.S. Patent 9,333,242 contains claims directed to a transdermal gel composition containing the unique formulation of H100™. U.S. Patent 9,238,059 contains claims directed to a method for inhibiting or treating Peyronie’s disease, comprising topically administering to a portion of penile dermis of a human with Peyronie’s disease an effective amount of a gel composition containing the formulation of H100™. Additionally, U.S. Patent 10,471,131 contains further formulation claims and method of treatment claims directed to the use of H100™ in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease. There are two corresponding European Patents (EP3269372B and EP2804606B) that have similar corresponding issued claims. The Hybrid License terminates upon the expiration of the latest patent noted above.
Upon entering the Hybrid License, we paid an initial license fee of $100,000 and additional payments of $250,000, and we will pay to Hybrid additional annual milestone payments of $125,000, $150,000 and $200,000 on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the entry into the Hybrid License, and $250,000 annual milestone payments for each year thereafter. We are also required to make a $1,000,000 payment upon the first commercial sale and are required to make additional payments on a sliding scale of percentages of net sales in the low single digits. Annual anniversary payments will not be required after commercialization. The Company is also obligated to make royalty payments between 3-6% of any net sales. We also expect to incur approximately $14 million of research and development expenses relating to H100™ over the estimated four to six-year period of clinical development prior to FDA approval, including approximately $10 million for clinical trials and $4 million of other expenses.
