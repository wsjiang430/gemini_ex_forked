General Development of Business
 
Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. (references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “company”, or “TCH”) was incorporated on October 24, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
In September 2014, TCH became a holding company with the completion of a Plan of Merger (“Merger”) between Twinlab Consolidation Corporation (“TCC”) and a subsidiary of TCH with TCC surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCH. Our operational focus redirected to TCC, which through its operating subsidiaries developed, manufactured and marketed high-quality, science-based nutritional supplements, as well as to our consolidation strategy of additional acquisitions and integration of acquired companies, as more fully described below under "Business Strategy." As part of such strategy, following the Merger, we focused significantly on successfully obtaining funding for and completing two acquisitions for which TCC had acquired options prior to the Merger, and which in combination with the TCC operating businesses acquired in the Merger form the foundation for our consolidation and growth strategy. The first was the acquisition of the customer relationships of Nutricap Labs, LLC ("Nutricap"), a provider of dietary supplement contract manufacturing services, into our subsidiary NutraScience Labs, Inc. ("NutraScience") on February 6, 2015, and the second was completed on October 5, 2015 with the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Organic Holdings, LLC ("Organic Holdings"), a market leader in the healthy aging and beauty from within categories and owner of the award-winning Reserveage™ Nutrition brand. In 2018, the Company introduced and developed new brands to bring natural health to the forefront; specifically, REAAL™ a line of products based on a patented blend of essential amino acids that have been studied in over 25 clinical and medical settings to help maintain lean muscle. Also, in December 2018 Twinlab announced it would be launching another new brand, Phytocab™, a legal CBD based product. This brand integrates well accepted dietary ingredients into hemp-derived full spectrum phytocannabinoids, which provide for overall health and wellbeing. The addition of innovated new brands and concepts is what ties together the TCC family of brands.
 
TCC was incorporated on October 1, 2013 in the state of Delaware. TCC was formed to affect a consolidation strategy in the fragmented vitamin, mineral, herbal and other nutritional supplements sectors of the health and wellness industry (the "H&W Industry"). Since TCC's formation we have executed on this strategy in an effort to capitalize on the opportunity for consolidation that we believe exists in the H&W Industry.
 
In August 2014, TCC acquired Idea Sphere Inc., a Michigan corporation ("Idea Sphere"), and its subsidiaries. Also, in August 2014, the name of Idea Sphere was changed to Twinlab Holdings, Inc. (“THI”), which is a holding company that owns and operates Twinlab Corporation, Inc., a marketer of high-quality, science-based nutritional supplements under a number of brand names.
 
THI was incorporated on April 10, 2001. In November 2005, THI completed the acquisition of Metabolife International, Inc. and its subsidiary Alpine Health Products, LLC. Through this acquisition, THI expanded its presence in the diet and energy category. In September 2006, THI acquired the assets of Cole Water Company, LLC ("Cole Water"), which owned an aquifer with a recharging spring of naturally calcium-enriched water. This transaction included the acquisition of real property at 51 Strawtown Pike, Peru, Indiana that holds the natural aquifer as well as a bottling facility. Cole Water has marketed calcium-enriched water under a number of brand names. In December 2013, THI discontinued operations of its water products line.
 
In November 2013, THI acquired certain assets of PatentHealth LLC, primarily the Trigosamine® brand, out of receivership, expanding THI's brand footprint to include the fast-growing joint support category in the mass market and drugstore channels. In February 2015, TCC’s NutraScience acquired the customer relationships of Nutricap, a provider of nutritional supplement contract manufacturing services. In October 2015, TCC acquired all the membership units of Organic Holdings, which, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of developing and selling premium nutritional supplements, including the award-winning Reserveage™ Nutrition brand. With this acquisition, we significantly expanded our brand portfolio through the addition of a market leader for resveratrol and collagen supplements in the expanding healthy aging and beauty from within categories.
 
We maintain our principal executive offices at 4800 T-Rex Avenue, Suite 305, Boca Raton, Florida. TCC's wholly owned subsidiaries are THI, NutraScience, NutraScience Labs IP Corporation, and Organic Holdings. THI's wholly owned subsidiaries are Twinlab Corporation (sometimes referred to herein as "Twinlab"), which markets nutritional supplements under its own brands and for others, and ISI Brands, Inc. ("ISI"), which holds title to the intellectual property used in the manufacturing and marketing activities of Twinlab Corporation. Organic Holdings' wholly-owned operating subsidiaries are CocoaWell, LLC, Fembody, LLC, InnoVitamin Organics, LLC, Joie Essance, LLC, Organics Management LLC, Re-Body, LLC, Reserve Life Organics, LLC, ResVitale, LLC, Reserve Life Nutrition, L.L.C., and Innovita Specialty Distribution LLC.
 
For convenience in this report, the terms "Company," "we" and "us" may be used to refer to Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries, except where indicated otherwise, and the term "TCC" may be used to refer to Twinlab Consolidation Corporation and/or its subsidiaries.

Business Overview
 
General
 
We are a marketer, distributor and direct to consumer retailer of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products sold to and through domestic health and natural food stores, mass market retailers, specialty stores retailers, on-line retailers and websites. Internationally, we market and distribute branded nutritional supplements and other natural products to and through health and natural product distributors and retailers.
 
Through NutraScience Labs, we also provide contract manufacturing services for private label products. Our contract manufacturing services business involves the manufacture of custom products to the specifications of a customer who requires finished products under the customer’s own brand name. We do not market these private label products as our business is to sell the products to the customer, who then markets and sells the products to retailers or end consumers.
 
Business Strategy
 
We target consumers searching for high quality nutritional supplements and other natural products. We believe many of these consumers shop in sales channels that offer meaningful education, service and support to their customers.
 
The primary channel that offers this type of support to consumers in the United States has been the health and natural food channel ("HNF"). Our primary focus and strength have been and remain on this channel. This strategy has enabled us to benefit from the growth of the HNF channel. The HNF channel consists of approximately 35,500 retailers, including (i) independent health and natural food stores, (ii) health and natural food stores affiliated with local, regional and national health and natural food chains (including health and natural food store chains, such as Whole Foods Market, and vitamin store chains, such as The Vitamin Shoppe and Vitamin World) and (iii) GNC stores. The HNF channel principally caters to our primary target consumers: those who desire product education, service and high-quality nutritional supplements and other natural products.
 
We develop, market and distribute our branded products, particularly the Twinlab®, Alvita® and Metabolife® brands. We market our branded products through a combination of our own sales force and independent brokers dedicated to the HNF channel. We continue to seek out partners that have strong customer relationships, reach into our target channels and have acted to realign our independent broker network to gain market share. The key to the strength of our brands and market position is innovation, as we seek to be a market leader in the development of new and innovative products. We believe that we benefit from greater customer and product diversification than many of our competitors due to our research and development, manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities.
 
We also believe that consumers seeking high quality products are also purchasing them through other channels, such as health care practitioners and direct to consumer channels and we continue to seek opportunities to reach our target consumers through these and additional channels.
 
An integral part of our business strategy has been to acquire, integrate and operate businesses in the natural products industry that manufacture, market and distribute branded nutritional supplements. We believe that the consolidation and integration of these acquired businesses provides ongoing financial and operational synergies through increased scale and market penetration, as well as strengthened customer relationships. Our near-term focus is on harnessing the respective strengths of our existing businesses, while continuing to seek longer-term opportunities that will either strengthen our product offering, and/or expand our distribution and geographic reach.
 
Industry
 
According to Nutrition Business Journal, the total retail natural products market (the "Natural Products Market") is fragmented and totaled approximately $207 billion in retail sales in 2017. The Natural Products Market is comprised of the following primary submarkets (with estimated 2017 sales indicated): (i) natural and organic functional foods, $144 billion, (ii) vitamins, minerals and supplements, $44 billion, and (iii) natural and organic personal care $20 billion. Historically, our primary focus has been on vitamins, minerals and supplements (the "VMS Market"). Our business plan includes expansion into other channels of the Natural Products Market: specifically, natural and organic personal care and natural and organic functional foods.
 
 6



The total retail VMS Market is highly fragmented with estimated sales of $44 billion in 2017 increased from $41.2 billion in 2016. We believe that the VMS Market reached its present size due to a number of factors, including (i) interest in healthier lifestyles, living longer and living well, (ii) the publication of research findings supporting the positive health effects of certain nutritional supplements (iii) the growth of the wellness conscious millennial population, combined with the aging of the "Baby Boom" and Gen X generations making a mindful choice to purchase more nutritional supplements and natural foods.
 
Products
 
We formulate and market nutritional supplements. Our products include vitamins, minerals, specialty supplements and sports nutrition products primarily under the Twinlab® (including the Twinlab® Fuel brand of sports nutrition products), Reserveage™ and ResVitale® brands. We also market and sell diet and energy products under the Metabolife® and Re-Body® brands and a full line of herbal teas under the Alvita® brand. To accommodate consumer preferences, our products come in various formulations and delivery forms, including capsules, tablets, softgels, chewables, liquids, sprays, and powders.
 
We currently market our products through a multiple brand strategy to offer more customer choice and to encourage retailers to allocate additional shelf space to our brands. We have worked to enhance the strength of our brands by instituting business strategies that have included (i) consolidating our product assortment to focus on top selling, profitable products, (ii) engaging independent brokers to support sales across the United States, (iii) creating performance and growth-based incentives for sales representatives, (iv) conducting cost savings initiatives to identify opportunities for improved margin, (v) reviewing competitive product pricing to make recommendations for market pricing alignment and (vi) completing product certifications to increase our competitive position. We believe our current portfolio of products resonates well with target consumers and retailers and provides us with significant competitive differentiation.
 
Sales, Marketing and Promotion
 
Our marketing and sales efforts are directed to promote demand for our products by educating retailers, who in turn educate their customers, on the quality and attributes of our natural nutritional supplements and other products. Our branded products are sold globally, and our primary market is the United States where our key sales channel is HNF. We believe that our products are attractive to HNF retailers due to factors such as the strength of our brand names, the breadth of our product offerings, the quality and efficacy of our products and the availability of service, sales support and educational materials. We have developed numerous Internet sites (including www.alvita.com, www.metabolife.com, www.reserveage.com, www.resvitale.com, and www.twinlab.com) that provide information about our branded lines and the various products within each brand. We have included our Internet sites here and elsewhere only as an inactive textual reference. The information contained on the Internet site is not incorporated by reference into this Report.
Sales
 
We employ a sales force dedicated to each of the individual channels in which we sell our products. The dynamics and buying patterns of the various channels require strategic initiatives and tactics. Our sales strategy includes several models that are applied to best serve the respective channels where our products are sold:

(i) | Direct sales representatives regularly visit each assigned customer in their respective areas to assist in the procurement of orders for products, provide related product sales assistance and introduce new products to buyers.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | In addition to our field representatives, we dedicate a skilled sales force that maintains communication with customers based on their purchasing history.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | We also engage an independent broker network, where we leverage their particular expertise and relationships with customers.
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | Additionally, our products are sold through the sales force of distributors who carry select product lines.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing and Promotion
 
TCC markets to consumers shopping through numerous retail channels and online e-tailers. Each channel demands a different approach that meets its distinctive needs. The following is a brief overview of the channels in which we market our varied brands:

Sales Channel | Specifics 
------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing strategies for Reserveage™ Nutrition include two main initiatives: 1) introduce new users to our core categories – anti-aging and beauty from within – through innovation, product trial, advertising and promotional programs and 2) increase in-store education through dedicated brand ambassadors in strategic markets.
 
Marketing and promotional efforts for Reserveage™ Nutrition focus on both trade and consumer tactics:
 
Public Relations/Bloggers – Outreach to media and blogger influencers has resulted in features and reviews in online and print media channels. This channel is especially important in our beauty from within line of products, where online influencers can both positively and negatively affect the success of a product.
 
Sampling – Many products are immediately experiential either because of their taste or effect. We use samples and retail demo programs to allow for trial and education of our products. These are generally conducted in-store using our own brand ambassadors or third-party representatives.
 
Retail Activation – Utilizing on-shelf promotional tactics, including coupons and associate engagement tools, to generate awareness and differentiate our brand.
 
Consumer and Trade Print Ads – Print advertising is coordinated with product introductions.
 
Digital/Social Activation - Target and retarget prospective consumers through search engine optimization, search engine marketing, and social media campaigns.

Marketing strategies for the ResVitale® brand include two main initiatives: 1) introduce new users to our core categories – anti-aging and beauty from within – through awareness campaigns and product trial and 2) increase in-store education through brand ambassadors in strategic markets.
 
Twinlab® Brand Vitamins
 
Twinlab® is a heritage brand of vitamins that has been in the market for nearly 50 years and carries a great deal of brand awareness amongst health and natural food consumers.

Marketing and promotional efforts for Twinlab® focus on both trade and consumer tactics:
 
Public Relations and Bloggers – Outreach to media and blogger influencers has resulted in features and reviews in online and print media channels.
 
Retailer Promotions – In-store promotional programs can drive consumer awareness when they are making purchase decisions. Manufacturer charge-backs, which deduct the cost of these programs from retailer product purchases, are created for retailers to support product features and promotions throughout the year. These programs are designed to incentivize the retailer to display products in secondary placement (multiple store locations) and often provide a discount to create excitement and deliver incremental savings in order to drive consumer purchases.
 
Coupons – Coupons are incorporated into different communication vehicles when appropriate to drive product trial use and create excitement.
 
Consumer and Trade Print Ads – Print advertising is coordinated with product introductions.
 
Trade Shows – Retailer relations and new product launches are the main areas of focus during trade shows. Display and promotion of products at several industry trade shows annually is a key component of support for Twinlab®.
 
Twinlab® Fuel and REAAL 
 
Marketing and promotional efforts for Twinlab® Fuel and REAAL focus on consumer tactics:
 
Promotions - Promotional activity, including branded gear, helps keep consumers interested in the brand dynamic.
 
International Marketing - Internationally, we partner with our top distributors who follow a similar strategy at a local level, helping to create awareness, interest and drive sales. 
 
Social Media - Instagram and Facebook are mainstays for our digital strategy, with exploration into new “Live” video options offered by each platform, allowing us to deepen our connection with our consumers. 
 
Alvita® Teas
 
Started in 1922, Alvita® Teas is an herbal therapeutic tea line with a rich history and loyal customer base. The herb alfalfa, long known for its beneficial nutrients, was packaged in tea bags and sold to an emerging health food market. This product became known as Alvita®. Over 90 years later, Alvita® has become the oldest herbal tea brand. Today, Alvita® has more than 40 single ingredient high potency teas, each with distinct health benefits. Each tea is committed to third party certifications and offers the purity standards of Organic, Gluten-free, non-GMO, caffeine free and Kosher certifications.
 
Marketing tactics for Alvita® include retailer promotions, coupons and trade show participation.
 
NutraScience Labs, Inc.

Marketing activities for NutraScience Labs focuses on promoting the services it offers with a focus on acquiring new customers through digital marketing and trade media and not advertising of products.
Research and Development; Quality Control
 
We have a commitment to research and development (“R&D”) and to introducing innovative products to correspond with consumer trends and scientific research. We believe that product quality and innovation are fundamental to our long-term growth and success. Through our R&D efforts, we seek to (i) test the safety, purity and potency of products, (ii) develop testing methods for ensuring and verifying the consistency of the dosage of ingredients included in our products, (iii) develop new, more effective product delivery forms and (iv) develop new products either by combining existing ingredients used in nutritional supplements or identifying new ingredients that can be used in nutritional supplements. Our efforts are designed to lead not only to the development of new and improved products, but also to ensure effective manufacturing quality control measures.
 
We conduct R&D in-house and also work with outside firms to perform testing and other aspects of R&D. We currently employ various professionals in R&D and quality control with expertise in, among other things, chemistry, microbiology and engineering. In addition, we retain the services of outside laboratories to validate our product standards and manufacturing protocols.

Our quality control and safety programs seek to ensure the safety and superior quality of our products and that they are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”). We have always had a focus on safety, quality, efficacy and compliance with law. Our processing methods are monitored closely to ensure that only quality ingredients are used and to ensure product purity.
 
Significant Customers
 
Sales to our top three customers aggregated to approximately 26% and 30% of total consolidated sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales to the largest one of those customers were approximately 12% of total sales in 2018 and 2017. Accounts receivable from these customers were approximately 22% and 36% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A single customer represents 14% of total accounts receivable. The decrease in sales to these customers was primarily caused by product demand being far greater than our supplies of inventory during 2018, complicated by the Utah facility transition, which further limited our ability to service these significant customers. As we increase inventory to levels to meet demand, we will continue to strategically diversify our offerings and channels to lessen dependence upon any one customer or group of customers.
Manufacturing
 
Our products are manufactured by highly qualified third-party providers located primarily in the U.S. These contract manufacturers do business with us under both short- and long-term contracts depending on our needs. We do not manufacture any of the basic materials used in packaging (bottles, boxes, shipping cartons, caps, tamper resistant films, etc.). We believe that increasing manufacturing capabilities through our contract manufacturer partners, provides us with competitive advantages.
 
In 2018, we transitioned out of manufacturing in the Company’s Utah facility and leveraged the supply chain of the Company’s successful subsidiary, NutraScience Labs, and third-party logistics providers. This allows us to utilize exclusive technologies and processes that contribute to product innovation, while still providing the high-quality products our customers know us for.
 
Materials and Suppliers
 
We employ a supply chain staff that works with marketing, product development, formulations and quality control personnel to oversee contract manufacturers and source raw materials for products as well as other items purchased by us. Raw materials are sourced by a variety of domestically and internationally approved suppliers principally from the United States, Europe and China. We believe our relationships with our principal suppliers, are good. Our top two suppliers accounted for 42% of our purchases for the year ended December 31, 2018. Whenever possible we have adopted dual sourcing for raw materials to mitigate the impact of raw materials shortages that happen from time to time.
Government Regulation
 
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by a number of federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Agency (“OSHA”), Department of Homeland Security Customs and Boarder Protection (“CBP”), Department of Transportation (“DOT”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, and by governmental agencies in countries outside the United States in which our products are sold.
 
The FDA regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food, including dietary supplements, cosmetics, and over-the-counter ("OTC") drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress, seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority.
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) was enacted in 1994, amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a "new dietary ingredient" premarket notification to the FDA. New dietary ingredients, with exception, not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, are required to be submitted to the FDA at least seventy-five days before marketing. Among other things, DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as "food additives" and allows the use of statements of structure function claims on product labels and in labeling, so long as those statements do not constitute disease claims and are truthful and sufficiently substantiated. Some of our products are also regulated as conventional foods under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (“NLEA”).
 
 10



The FDA issued a Final Rule on GMPs (Good Manufacturing Practices) for dietary supplements in June 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers, packagers, labelers, distributors, and holders of finished dietary supplement products, including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things, these GMPs require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients, call for a "scientifically valid system" for ensuring finished products meet all specifications, include requirements related to process controls such as statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures and require extensive recordkeeping.
 
The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act went into effect in December 2007. The law requires, among other things, that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious).
 
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 ("CPSIA") primarily addresses children's product safety but also improves the administrative process of the CPSC. Among other things, the CPSC/CPSIA impact on dietary supplements is principally in requirements for use of child resistant closures, performance validation of such closures, and requirements for packaging and labeling of iron-containing products. The CPSIA also requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances the CPSC's authority to order recalls. 
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), enacted in January 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA's authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include, but are not limited to, the FDA's expanded access to records; the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.
 
Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from preventive controls requirements, dietary ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. FDA's proposed preventative controls regulations would require that facilities develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly minimized or prevented, monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls, and maintain numerous records related to those controls. 
 
California Proposition 65 (“Prop 65”) is particularly impactful and imposing among state regulations. Its impact on product formulations, testing, and labeling are extensive and significant. Because of national brand distribution, the impact of Prop 65 is far reaching. TCC has several Prop 65 consent agreements which afford compliance protections.
 
The sale of our products in countries outside the United States is regulated by the governments of those countries. Our plans to commence or expand sales in those countries may be prevented or delayed or even suspended by such regulations or regulators in those countries. In countries in which we have distributors, compliance with such regulations is generally undertaken by our distributors, but even in these cases we often cooperate by providing information to distributors. In the case of Canada, TCC complies with Health Canada’s Natural Health Products Directorate (“NHPD”) with “site licensing” of the TCC manufacturing plant and registration of products.
 
Competition
 
Health and Natural Foods
 
The Natural Products Market and the VMS Market are highly competitive. Our principal competitors in the VMS market that sell to the health and natural foods channel include a number of large, nationally-known brands (such as Bluebonnet, Country Life, Enzymatic Therapy, Garden of Life, Jarrow Formulas, Natural Factors, Nature's Plus, Nature's Way, Nordic Naturals, Now Foods, New Chapter and Solgar) and many smaller brands, manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements. Because both the health and natural foods market and the VMS Market generally have low barriers to entry, additional competitors enter the market regularly.
 
Private label products of our customers also provide competition to our products. Whole Foods Market, The Vitamin Shoppe, Sprouts Farmers Market, Natural Grocers and many health and natural food stores also sell a portion of their offerings under their own private labels. Private label products are often sold at a discount to branded products.
 
 11



We believe that stores in the HNF channel are increasingly likely to align themselves with those companies that offer a wide variety of high-quality products, have a loyal consumer base, support their brands with strong marketing and education programs and provide consistently high levels of customer service. We believe that we compete favorably with other nutritional supplement companies because of our comprehensive line of products and brands, premium brand names, commitment to quality, ability to rapidly introduce innovative products, competitive pricing, strong and effective sales force, distribution strategy and sophisticated marketing and promotional support. The wide variety and diversity of the forms, potencies and categories of our products are important points of differentiation between us and many of our competitors.
 
Mass Market
 
Metabolife® is our primary focus in the Mass Market retail channel. It is possible that as an increasing numbers of companies (or brands) sell nutritional supplement products and other natural products in the mass market channels, such as Pharmavite (Nature Made), KKR & Co. L.P. (Nature's Bounty), Reckitt Benckiser Group (Schiff), Hain Celestial and Church & Dwight, our mass market brands will be negatively impacted. In addition, several major pharmaceutical companies continue to offer nutritional supplement lines in the mass market channel, including Pfizer (Centrum) and Bayer (One-A-Day).
Performance
 
The performance channel is primarily made up of independent retailers that focus their product mix on performance products, as well as gyms, health clubs and other health and fitness locations that house small stores to cater to the needs of their clients. There is also a small vibrant market serviced by bicycle shops and other specialty sports equipment retailers, and even larger sporting goods stores, like Dick’s Sporting Goods, which are testing sports nutrition sets in their stores. The retail performance channel is supplied by a specialty distributor that focuses exclusively on this channel. In recent years the performance channel has become dominated by several online retailers (www.allstarhealth.com, www.bodybuilding.com, www.dpsnutrition.com, www.muscleandstrength.com, www.netrition.com, and www.supplementwarehouse.com) that have the advantage of broad selection and aggressive pricing.
 
Competition in this channel is intense. The character of the target customer makes the barriers to entry in sports nutrition extremely low as consumers look for the next great product that will help them optimize their workout. As a result, competition for Twinlab includes the somewhat large stable core brands (BSN, CytoSport, Five Star, Met-Rx, MHP, MRI, MusclePharm, Optimum Nutrition, VPX, etc.) as well as a secondary level of innovative, small companies with niche products focused on this specific targeted customer.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own numerous trademarks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and have filed applications to register additional trademarks. In addition, we claim domestic trademark and service mark rights in numerous additional marks that we use. We own a number of trademark registrations in countries outside the United States. Federally registered trademarks in the United States have a perpetual life, as long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. Most foreign trademark offices use similar trademark renewal processes. Additionally, we hold several patents that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and may file additional applications. We regard our trademarks, patents and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe they make a significant positive contribution to the marketing of our products.
 
We protect our legal rights concerning our intellectual property by appropriate legal action. We rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. Common law trademark rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a United States federal registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We have registered and intend to register certain trademarks in certain limited jurisdictions outside the United States where our products are sold, but we may not register all or even some of our trademarks in every country in which we conduct business or intend to conduct business.
 
We sell many products that include patented ingredients. We purchase these ingredients from parties that we believe are licensed by the patent owner to sell and manufacture goods with the patent ingredients. However, there are a large number of patents that have been granted or applied for in the dietary supplement industry, and there may be an increased possibility that third parties will seek to compel us and our competitors to purchase their patented ingredients directly from them under threat that patent ingredient we properly obtain, infringes on their patent rights. We generally obtain indemnification from the patent owner through separate end user licensing agreements to increase our protection from these third parties or “non-practicing entities,” should they try to enforce such claim through litigation. The cost of these patented ingredients is typically higher than the cost of non-patented ingredients.
