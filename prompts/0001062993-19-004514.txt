 OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 Play MPE® 
 Our core business is the Play MPE® platform, a two sided marketplace that enables music labels and artists to create and distribute promotional content and musical assets on the one side, and for music broadcasting professionals, music curators and music reviewers to be able to discover, listen to, download and consume, on the other. Play MPE® is a cloud-based enterprise SaaS product. 
 Typically, record labels and artists promote new music through the presentation of broadcast quality audio, video, images, promotional information, industry required meta data, and other digital content. The presentation of this promotional material is catered to music curators who can expose that music to a larger consumer audience through broadcasts (examples include radio, internet radio, streaming services, DJs etc.) or publicity and media destinations. The system is also used to promote music and artists to label A&R teams, and music supervisors (who work with TV/movie producers to recommend musical content to accompany video productions). 
 Broadcast play of music provides revenue directly to record labels and artists through royalties and indirectly through sales, concerts / live performances, merchandise sales etc. as the profile and popularity of the musical work and artist increase. Effective marketing is critical in growing the popularity of a song or an artist and thereby revenue for a particular artist. Play MPE® is a critical step in this process. Easy-to-use and collaborative tools on the player side (music curator side) improves activity which improves the likelihood that a particular track obtains broadcast play. Feedback of recipient activity provides valuable information to record labels improving data centric marketing decision making. 
 Our customers range from small independent artists, small to large independent record labels (Indies), to promoters, and to the worlds largest record labels (the Major Record Labels) (Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment). Our Major Record Label clients have offices around the world and typically represent the worlds largest recording artists. All three Major Record Labels, and thousands of Indies use Play MPE® for promotional distribution. 
 Play MPE® provides a wide array of features which provide efficient access to a promotional hub of activity. Client characteristics determine which features are of greater interest with the active promotional recipients being of common interest to all clients. Major Labels can take advantage of the platforms more powerful and efficiency producing features including tiered rights, permissions based user profiles, integration with database archives, release sharing with foreign territories etc. For example, some customer staff may manage assets (album cover imagery, music videos, the raw music, promotional information and other metadata), while others manage hierarchical permission-based lists of recipients. These more powerful features are unique to the Play MPE® platform.

The release dates for music can be dependent on the territory and, where administrative settings permit, local promotions staff may generate a localized distribution of the song with modified marketing information in the local language. Local staff may select pre-existing assets from the system and combine them together with a local recipient lists to form a send. Our customers also choose the level of access for the recipients assigned to the release by designating whether the release can be streamed, downloaded, exported into an unlocked digital format or burned to a CD. 
 While many clients are set up to manage and upload recipient lists, many rely on the proprietary lists provided within the service. Our staff manages lists of recipients in various formats and geographies and those lists are made available to our customers using the Play MPE® system. The Play MPE® system provides Play MPE® staff with the feedback and resources necessary to manage and maintain this network of recipients, which is not available with physical distribution or by smaller competitors. Customers select lists of recipients within the proprietary network based on music format and geography. 
 All exported songs are marked in real time with Destinys watermark technology, which has received three US patents and a number of analogous patents globally. From information provided by Play MPE®, songs appearing on the internet can be scanned by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industrys (IFPI). Headquartered in London, UK, the IFPI is the organization that represents the interests of the recording industry worldwide and one of its missions is to safeguard the rights of record producers. IFPI web crawlers visit torrents, peer to peer networks and websites searching for unauthorized content. When problem files are identified, the IFPI can run proprietary software to identify Play MPE®s unique watermark to identify the originating source. 
 After the content is released, all activity by the recipient is logged in real time, providing record labels and promotions staff real time detail on which songs are accessed, streamed, downloaded and exported. This information provides valuable feedback in real time to marketing and promotions staff who can cater their programs appropriately. Recipients receive a custom library of available tracks and are able to repeat the download if music is lost. 
 In July 2018, we launched version 8 of our release publishing tools for Play MPE®. These new browser-based tools are accessible on any computer without installation and completely replaced the Windows based desktop tools previously used by our customers. This new solution provides for increased usage of Play MPE® through an easier to use, faster, more intuitive and streamlined experience, access to both Mac and PC users, new release creation workflows, and more configuration options. The tool provides release sharing capabilities, to facilitate faster more user-friendly sharing of assets by our global label customers. Finally, it also allows for easy translation into multiple languages to accelerate international expansion. The new encoder has been fully adopted by our sales department and by the majority of our customers into their own internal workflows. 
 We continue to invest in additional development of Play MPE® Version 8 and related tools and applications. In July 2018, we integrated with Aspen, an archival system used by one of our key customers, Universal Music Group (UMG). This integration provided improved efficiencies in UMGs daily workflow. In March 2019, we announced a new integration of Play MPE® with Nielsens BDSradio, which provides Nielsen Music users with an instant gateway into Play MPE®s extensive release catalog and high-quality content directly from the BDSradio platform. 
 In May 2019, we released new iOS and Android apps of our Play MPE® recipient player. The new apps feature added capabilities from previous versions, including Google Chromecast and Airplay streaming capabilities for greater recipient collaboration, additional playlists, sorting, flagging and archiving features, improved search capabilities, and easier to access release metadata. In addition, we are developing a new entirely browser-based Play MPE® recipient player, which should lead to higher usage by our customers and recipients. 
 Given the current music promotion and discovery landscapes, we plan to expand Play MPE®s reach more broadly from its current service offerings. We believe there is great business value in integrating our Play MPE® service into additional workflows which are already a part of our customers daily routine, so that we eventually are the entire software ecosystem for our customers.

 Clipstream®
  The Company also has a legacy business, Clipstream®, in the online video industry for which it is pursuing strategic alternatives. The Clipstream® Online Video Platform (OVP) is a self-service system, for encoding, hosting and reporting on video playback which can be embedded in third party websites or emails. Playback is currently through the Company’s proprietary JavaScript codec engine, which is only available on the internet through the Company. The unique software-based approach to rendering video, is protected by over two dozen patents claiming initial priority to 2011. This product is marketed in a limited way and has incidental revenues. 
  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
  Play MPE®
  During the year ended August 31, 2019, we generated revenues of $3,809,092, of which 99% was derived from Play MPE® and was 5.6% higher than prior year, or 8.6% higher than prior year on a currency adjusted basis. 
  During fiscal 2019, our focus was to transition our clients to newly released Play MPE® Version 8 tools and applications, and to continue to develop features within the system to improve ease of use and business development conversion. With user experience improvements we were able to increase customer usage, reacquire customers and commence trial usage. 
  Our strategy within new market segments is to create a hub of activity by providing content and attracting recipient usage. Easier to use tools facilitate this process. In fiscal 2019, we have also expanded use with Major Labels in new genres in the United States, new usage in the Baltic countries, and have commenced early trial use with new customers in the United Kingdom, Canada and, immediately following fiscal year end, we have commenced new trial usage in South Africa. 
  Play MPE® staff regularly attend various industry events, conferences and seminars, to establish and strengthen relationships with industry promoters, record labels, and other key industry people. Potential new customers may be set up on an initial trial of our system, providing for increased engagement and feedback from these industry professionals. Other business development efforts are also focused on moving existing customers to monthly subscription or custom pricing that encourages more usage of the system. We have significantly increased our business development efforts during fiscal 2019, adding additional staff, and establishing a more organized process of engaging with our existing and prospective customers. 
  In 2019, we doubled the size of our business development team including our first marketing manager. Our focus going forward will be to leverage the expanded business development team to grow usage in new markets, add product features, and improve product design to facilitate the expanded development team’s success with enterprise accounts as well as provide easy access to self-serve customers. Longer term the Company will continue to add premium features and products to expand the addressable market. 
  Clipstream® 
 In fiscal 2018, after completing a detailed review of the resources required to progress Clipstream further, the Company transitioned the Clipstream® product to maintenance only, stopping development of new major features. Business development efforts are focused on identifying strategic alternatives for this product, business, and intellectual property outside the Company. 
  Significant Customers 
 During the year ended August 31, 2019, we generated 41% of total revenue from one customer (2018 - 42%).

OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS
 We lease approximately 6,600 square feet of office space, with the lease expiring in June of 2022, and we currently have 29 total employees. Our employees include our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, two finance and administrative personnel, five operational and technical support staff, seven sales and marketing staff, two product development staff, and eleven software developers. We also employ contractors as needed. 
COMPETITION 
 Play MPE®
 Play MPE® has regional competitors with limited global presence and limited functionality while Play MPE® has Major Record Label use globally. A network effect entrenches the system, as it is difficult for any single user to switch to an alternative without the entire industry switching. Play MPE® has a dominant network position in several markets including in the United States (in the country, Christian and alternative genres of music), Australia and New Zealand, Sweden, and Finland, with various levels of market penetration in numerous additional markets around the globe. 
 The system was built to facilitate sharing of assets and content with regional subsidiaries and affiliates of our Major Record Label customers. This allows local representatives to localize the release resulting in costs savings and efficiencies not available in competing solutions. 
 Play MPE® began a digital replacement to physical distribution (mail, courier or hand delivery) of manufactured CDs establishing a foothold of use with recipients and record labels in 2002 through 2007. Play MPE® still encounters physical distribution as a competitive option for promotional distribution. Play MPE® has several advantages over physical distribution. Digital distribution through Play MPE® is faster, less expensive, more reliable, more secure, provides additional real time and more accurate reporting of usage, provides a great deal of added functionality and provides the error free and automatic transmission of metadata. Metadata includes International Standard Recording Codes (ISRC)  which is a standard code for uniquely identifying sound recordings and music video recordings - song and artist names, beats per minute, release and impact dates, etc. The automatic transmission of this metadata reduces the time required for manual data entry into radio automation software on the receiving side and eliminates inaccuracies in royalty reporting. This benefits labels who want to be in third party databases as the transmission of this data is immediate and reliable. 
 The Play MPE® system provides our clients with a sophisticated content management tool that includes privilege control, release sharing amongst global territories (saving our clients time and money when conducting global distributions), enhanced email notification and promotions tools, social media announcements, recipient player apps (iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac, Windows, and Web Browser), with a fully redundant high speed infrastructure that is more sophisticated and has higher functionality than quickly developed lower cost alternatives. The Company expects that competition will be strongest where audio quality, security, recipient network, and reporting are not as important as cost. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 We are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses. It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in both the United States and Canada with particular applicability to the Internet. Governments have and may continue to enact legislation applicable to us in areas such as content distribution, performance and copying, other copyright issues, network security, encryption, the use of key escrow data, privacy protection, caching of content by server products, electronic authentication or digital signatures, illegal or obscene content, access charges and retransmission activities. The applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, content, taxation, defamation and personal privacy is also uncertain. Export or import restrictions, new legislation or regulation or governmental enforcement of existing regulations may limit the growth of the Internet, increase our costs of doing business or increase its legal exposure. 
 The Company owns proprietary algorithms, source code, web domain addresses, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property.

Patents
 1.    Digital Locking "Digital Media Distribution Method and System" (US Patent No. 7466823) 
 This patent provides a method of locking digital content which prevents play back on unauthorized machines and devices. Claims include separating security from the content, so that content files can be shared securely over peer to peer networks. This is one of the earliest patents for securing peer to peer distributed content. 
 One of the more important claims in this patent is the ability to uniquely recognize a particular computer. Uniquely identifying a persons computer is a common issue which is usually approached by saving cookies or beacons to the users computer or by tracking IP addresses. These are not reliable solutions as cookies are easily deleted and IP addresses easily changed. Destinys propriety hash code process creates a serial number that can be used to recognize the user on subsequent visits without ever saving anything to that users computer. 
 2.    Watermarking "Methods for Watermarking Media Data" 
 
i. | US Patents No. 7983441,8300885, 9165560, 9679574
-----+-------------------------------------------------
ii. | US pending application No. 15/358834 
iii. | Japan Patent No. 5103479 
iv. | Canada patent No. 2682926 
v. | Europe and UK Patent No. 2082527 

 We have a developed a watermarking technology which can uniquely identify the individual who originally accessed a particular song. Our watermark is unique as it can be embedded and identified rapidly, it is inaudible, it survives on air broadcast, compression and conversion to other formats and is virtually impossible to remove. Our watermarking technology is used in the Play MPE® distribution system when songs are exported or when streaming a track. Other watermarking technologies are slow and provide a trade-off between a destruction of audio quality and the ease that they can be filtered out. When the original patent claims were granted in the US, the Company filed a set of new additional, broader claims in a continuation application in Canada and the US to further protect the technology. 
 3.    Cross Platform Streaming Video Script Based Video Rendering 
 
a. | US Patents No. 9143826, 9137567, 9215499, 9571886, 9380338, 9432726 and 9432727 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | China Patent No. 201280050754.7 
c. | Pending India Application No. 1961/DELNO/2014 

 This solution enables publishers to serve streaming video from their web site without the need for a separate streaming server. The solution will play instantly in all recent browsers, including mobile devices, without the need for a separate video player.
