---------+---------

Overview 
 We historically focused on the development of restorative cell therapies (RCTs).  We use the term RCT to refer to a new class of products that are designed to offer patients rapid-onset pain relief and restored function through the repair of damaged or worn tissue. Our product, NeoCart®, is an innovative cell therapy that utilizes various aspects of our RCT platform to treat tissue injury in the field of orthopedics, specifically cartilage damage in the knee.
Recent Developments 
 In the third quarter of 2018, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical trial of NeoCart did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in pain and function in a dual threshold responder analysis one year after treatment as compared to microfracture. In the modified Intent to Treat (mITT) population (which excludes those patients who were randomized but not treated with NeoCart), 74.2% of the NeoCart patients exhibited clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function compared to 62.0% of microfracture patients at one year (p=0.071). However, in this mITT population, patients treated with NeoCart achieved a statistically significant improvement in pain and function (p=0.018) six months after treatment as compared to patients treated with microfracture. In addition, NeoCart achieved a statistically significant improvement in pain and function at one year in certain patient populations including patients with lesion sizes greater than 2.2 cm2 and those with a Body Mass Index, or BMI, of greater than 28. Both NeoCart and microfracture were well tolerated and exhibited strong safety profiles.  
 Based on the totality of the data, we initiated a dialogue with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the third quarter of 2018 to discuss the regulatory path forward for NeoCart.  Our primary objective in these discussions was to determine whether the FDA would accept a submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for NeoCart without data from an additional clinical trial. We had a constructive dialogue with the FDA, which included requests for and review of additional statistical analyses, different subgroup analyses, and secondary endpoints.  These additional analyses, while compelling, did not change the conclusion that the NeoCart Phase 3 trial failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints. 
 In December 2018, we received final feedback from the FDA indicating that while the NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial resulted in certain compelling data, particularly the early response in pain and function and the data in certain lesion sizes, an additional Phase 3 clinical trial would need to be completed before the FDA would accept the submission of a BLA for NeoCart. The FDA indicated receptivity to novel clinical trial methodologies and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designations in order to support additional data for a future potential submission. However, considering the time and funding required to conduct such a trial, we discontinued the development of NeoCart and are not planning to submit a BLA.
 Current Strategy
 As a result of the FDA feedback, we initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. We are conducting the process with the assistance of financial and legal advisors and are evaluating the full range of potential strategic alternatives, including but not limited to, acquisitions, business combinations, joint ventures, public and private capital raises and recapitalization and sale transaction options, including a sale of assets or intellectual property. Since these efforts may not be successful and given our limited cash reserves, we are also considering other possible alternatives, including a wind-down of operations and a liquidation and dissolution of the Company, or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to complete or execute a restructuring transaction or liquidation. Our strategic process is ongoing and includes a range of interactions with transaction counterparties. Thus, we believe it is in our stockholders’ best interest to allow sufficient opportunity to pursue and consummate one or more such transactions and to consider additional alternatives that may materialize in the future before making a decision regarding a liquidation of the Company. There is no guarantee that any cash (or other securities representing any value) will be returned to stockholders and there is the possibility that the Company’s common stock will be worthless in a bankruptcy, wind-down or other liquidation scenario.
 In January and March 2019, we implemented restructuring plans that were approved by our Board of Directors (the Board) involving reductions in headcount to reduce operating costs and conserve cash, along with other cash 
 4


conservation measures relating to our facilities.  The positions eliminated as part of the restructuring plans together represented all but one member of our of our workforce, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Business Officer. We intend to engage, Mr. Adam Gridley, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Kennedy, our Chief Operating Officer, along with up to four additional employees as consultants to assist with our continuing evaluation of strategic alternatives. Mr. Gridley will retain his statutory titles of president, treasurer and secretary of the Company while he continues to provide consulting services to us, and will remain a director of the Company.
 NeoCart Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 The NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial is believed to be the largest and first prospectively designed, randomized clinical trial in North America evaluating the safety and efficacy of a restorative cell therapy to treat knee cartilage damage. It is also believed to be the only trial with a dual threshold responder analysis endpoint.
 As part of the prospective data analysis, we collected a variety of patient reported outcome endpoints, including all measures of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, which are validated, patient-centered assessments of pain and function that are commonly used in current clinical trials of cartilage therapies. On almost all of these measures, two of which are being utilized as primary endpoints in ongoing clinical trials by third parties in the U.S. for other therapies, NeoCart demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus microfracture at one and two years.
 The Phase 3 clinical trial is the first study prospectively enrolled consistent with current FDA guidance, which provides for the use of microfracture as a comparator treatment in trials to repair knee cartilage damage. The published FDA guidance also specifically calls for a study population that, given the clinical limitations and variable results of microfracture, we believe provides more favorable results than what is typically seen in microfracture in both the literature and a real-world setting.
 The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 clinical trial was a dual-threshold responder analysis measuring the improvement in KOOS pain and IKDC function scores for each patient treated with NeoCart compared to those treated with microfracture one year after the time of treatment. Dual-threshold responders were defined as patients who, relative to their baseline measurements, had at least a 12-point improvement in the KOOS pain sub-score assessment and a 20-point improvement in the IKDC subjective assessment. The trial also evaluated additional pain, quality of life, and function outcomes using all five measures of KOOS subscales, including Sports and Recreation. The change from baseline and the relative change between the NeoCart and microfracture arms was also measured at one year which contrasts with clinical trials of other products, either on the market or in development, that measured these changes at two years. 
 Demographics for both study arms were similar and represent a patient population that was intended to ensure that microfracture would respond favorably, including patients with an average age of approximately 39 years old and a Body Mass Index of approximately 27. Furthermore, the mean lesion size was 2.1 cm in the NeoCart arm and 1.8 cm in the microfracture arm. There were no other significant differences between the treatment arms.
 The results with respect to the primary endpoint (dual threshold responder analysis one year after treatment) are summarized below:
 
 
 | NeoCart | | Microfracture | | | 
-------------+---------------------+---------+----------------+------+---------------------+---------------
 | Positive Responders | | Responder Rate | | Positive Responders | Responder Rate | Difference | | 
ITT | | 121/170 | | 71.2 | % | 49/79 | | 62.0 | % | 9.2 | p=0.1877

• | Biomaterials and Scaffold: three-dimensional biomaterials and structures that enable the proper delivery, distribution and organization of cells in their natural environment to support tissue formation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tissue engineering: the use of a combination of cells, engineering and biomaterials to improve or restore biological functions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bioadhesives: natural, biocompatible materials that act as adhesives for biological tissue and allow for natural cell and tissue infiltration and integration with native cells.

Material Technology License Agreements 
 MEDINET Co., Ltd. 
 In December 2017, we entered into a License and Commercialization Agreement (the MEDINET Agreement) with MEDINET Co., Ltd. (MEDINET) with regards to the commercialization of NeoCart in Japan. Pursuant to the terms of the MEDINET Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of approximately $86.9 million in milestone payments plus royalties, consisting of (i) a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million which we received in January 2018, (ii) potential regulatory and development milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $10.5 million, (iii) overall sales-dependent milestones of up to an aggregate of $66.4 million and (iv) tiered royalties on net sales of NeoCart in Japan. In return for such consideration, we granted to MEDINET exclusive commercialization rights to NeoCart in Japan for the replacement or repair of damaged, worn or defective cartilage in humans and non-human animals.
 The MEDINET Agreement will remain in effect until the later of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire valid and enforceable patent covering NeoCart in Japan and (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of NeoCart in Japan. MEDINET has an option to extend the term for five years upon written notice to us prior to the end of the initial term. MEDINET has the right to terminate the MEDINET Agreement for any or no reason at any time, and we may terminate the MEDINET Agreement in the event MEDINET or one of its affiliates or sublicensees challenges a patent covering NeoCart in Japan. Additionally, either party may terminate the MEDINET Agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party or upon certain insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings involving the other party. We and MEDINET have agreed to indemnify each other for third-party claims arising out of either our or our affiliates’ willful misconduct or negligence, breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements contained in the MEDINET Agreement, or MEDINET’s exploitation of NeoCart in its respective territory, subject to specified exclusions.
 We and MEDINET have agreed to enter into supply, quality and pharmacovigilance agreements (the MEDINET Supply Agreements), pursuant to which MEDINET will purchase its requirements of NeoCart and the related biopsy kit from us. Pursuant to the terms of the MEDINET Agreement, the MEDINET Supply Agreements will contain provisions addressing several topics, including those set forth in the MEDINET Agreement. 
 Purpose Co., Ltd. 
 In May 2016, we amended our license agreement (the Amendment) with Purpose whereby we acquired the development and commercialization rights to NeoCart in Japan. Under the Amendment, we assumed sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of all or any portion our products in Japan. In addition, the amended agreement provides us with an exclusive, perpetual (with respect to patent rights, for the full term of each patent licensed) and sublicensable license, under Purpose’s patent rights and technology relating to their tissue processor, in Japan, to make, use, sell, import and otherwise exploit products or services covered by claims of such Purpose patents or Purpose’s technology, in connection with articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons and meniscus. The Amendment also terminates the license that Purpose held under the original license agreement to develop and commercialize Histogenics’ patents and technology in Japan. 
 Pursuant to the Amendment, we are obligated to pay Purpose payments of up to $10 million in the event certain milestones are satisfied as well as a royalty payment in the low single digits on the net sales in Japan for Histogenics products that rely on a Purpose patent or incorporate or necessarily rely upon any Purpose technology. Such royalty payment shall be reduced if the applicable Histogenics products do not rely on an outstanding Purpose patent. 
 The other terms of the agreement with Purpose remain in effect including our ability outside of Japan to (1) make, use and sell products or services covered by claims of Purpose’s patents and (2) use and create derivative works of Purpose’s technology for the design, development, manufacture, testing, support and commercialization of any product or service that incorporates or builds upon Purpose’s technology, in each case, only in connection with articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons and meniscus. Purpose retained the right to sell its single unit exogenous tissue processer machines to research institutes for general but noncommercial use anywhere in the world. 
 As part of our agreement with Purpose, they continue to manufacture and sell single unit exogenous tissue processor machines to us. In addition, Purpose exclusively sublicensed to us its rights and obligations under the BWH-Purpose 
 8


license, as amended from time to time. Under the Purpose-BWH license agreement, BWH granted Purpose an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, sublicensable license, under its rights in licensed patents and patent applications co-owned by BWH and Purpose, to make, use and sell (1) apparatuses for cultivating a cell or tissue, (2) tissue or cell products made using such apparatuses, (3) tissue or cell products made using processes for cultivating a cell or tissue as disclosed in the licensed patents and patent applications and (4) any apparatus that cultivates cells or tissues using such processes, in each case, whose manufacture, use, or sale is covered by the claims of the licensed patents and patent applications, only for therapeutic use. BWH may terminate this agreement if Purpose, itself or through its sublicensees, does not achieve commercial distribution and sale of the licensed products in the United States by December 31, 2019. In return for extending the termination period through December 31, 2019 pursuant to an amendment effective November 2015, we agreed to pay BWH $50,000 in November 2015 and three annual payments of $30,000 on the anniversary of the effective date of such amendment for the three years thereafter. 
 Pursuant to our sublicense from Purpose, we are obligated to pay royalties and milestone payments and sublicense payments due on the BWH-Purpose license agreement. We have paid minimum royalty amounts of $200,000 and sublicense payments of $285,000 through December 31, 2018. Purpose agreed to pay BWH a royalty rate in the low single digits of our net sales of licensed products, subject to a minimum of $20,000 annually, until the license agreement terminates or until royalty payments no longer have to be made. Purpose is obligated to make one additional sublicense payment of $25,000 and milestone payments to BWH of (1) $75,000 upon the first patient treated in Phase 3 clinical trials for each licensed product or licensed process and (2) $75,000 upon final FDA approval for each licensed product or licensed process. 
 The agreement remains in effect for the life of the licensed patents, expected to be until October 19, 2028. Purpose may terminate the agreement by providing written notice to BWH at least 60 days in advance. BWH has the right to terminate the agreement if Purpose fails to make minimum royalty payments or other payments or otherwise breaches the agreement and such breach is not cured within 30 days of BWH providing notice to Purpose. Upon termination of the BWH-Purpose license agreement, our sublicense will convert to a nonexclusive license to Purpose’s interest in the licensed products or processes. Upon written notice to Purpose of our intent to stop using the technology sublicensed to us in the BWH-Purpose license, Purpose will reassume all responsibility under the BWH-Purpose license. 
 Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (US), Inc. and Angiodevice International GmbH 
 In May 2005, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (US), Inc. and Angiodevice International GmbH (collectively, Angiotech) for the right, under Angiotech’s licensed patents and patent applications and technical information, to make, use and sell any product that includes both our intellectual property and CT3 for the repair of articular cartilage, ligament, meniscus or tendon damage, including related osteochrondal defects. The license excludes any product in which one nonliving ingredient is included in CT3 for the primary purpose of producing a physiological, metabolic or biological effect in mammals. The license grant was made exclusive under the fifth amendment to the license agreement that came into effect in August 2010. We have obligations to supply CT3 to Angiotech under certain terms and conditions, and Angiotech is entitled to use any data and results obtained from any clinical studies conducted by us with respect to CT3. 
 We paid $1.0 million to Angiotech to make the license grant under the agreement exclusive. In addition, we paid four annual patent fees of $50,000 each as of December 31, 2018. We are also obligated to pay an additional fee of $3.0 million within 30 days after we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for a licensed product. As further consideration for the license, we also agreed to pay royalties at percentage rates of single digits of net sales of NeoCart and certain other products. We were able to reduce royalties from percentage rates of net sales in the double digits to this rate after making revenue share reduction payments that totaled $2.0 million. 
 The agreement terminates on the earlier of May 12, 2035 and expiration of all royalty payment obligations under the agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days from the date of notice of such breach (ten days in the case of non-payment). We may also terminate the agreement by giving at least one year’s notice. Angiotech may also terminate the agreement if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees challenge the validity of Angiotech’s patents rights or rights to improvements (or directly or indirectly support any such challenge), or if we are acquired by or merge with a third party that has developed or is marketing, or has an affiliate that has developed or is marketing, a competitive 
 9


product prior to such acquisition or merger and the resulting or surviving entity post-acquisition or merger fails to either continue to develop or sell licensed product at a level reasonably similar to the development or sale that was occurring prior to the acquisition or merger, during the six-month period following the acquisition or merger. Competitive product means, in a given country, (1) a drug or biologic approved for marketing or in Phase 3 clinical development, (2) a 510(k), or foreign equivalent, device approved for marketing, or (3) an FDA Premarket Approval, or foreign equivalent, device approved for marketing or in pivotal study clinical development, other than a licensed product, that acts (or is being developed to act) for one or more target label indications substantially similar to one or more approved or target label indications for a licensed product. 
 Intrexon Corporation 
 In September 2014, we entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration (ECC) with Intrexon Corporation (Intrexon) governing a “channel collaboration” arrangement in which we intended to use Intrexon’s proprietary technology towards the design, identification, culturing and/or production of genetically modified cells (Technology). The ECC granted us an exclusive worldwide license to utilize Intrexon’s Technology to develop and commercialize allogeneic genetically modified chondrocyte cell therapeutics for the treatment or repair of damaged articular hyaline cartilage in humans.  
 In December 2018, we and Intrexon entered into a mutual termination and release agreement (the Mutual Termination Agreement) pursuant to which we and Intrexon mutually agreed to terminate ECC.  Pursuant to the ECC, we were responsible for the research and development costs incurred by Intrexon associated with the development of product candidates under the collaboration. As of December 21, 2018, the date of termination, we had accrued approximately $3.0 million of research and development expenses under the ECC (the Accrued Expenses).  In connection with the Mutual Termination Agreement, in lieu of payment of the Accrued Expenses, we agreed to pay Intrexon an aggregate of up to $1.5 million, with $0.375 million paid at the time of entering into the Mutual Termination Agreement and $1.125 million payable within one year following any submission of a BLA to the FDA for NeoCart. We adjusted the accrued expenses to reflect a $1.125 million balance as of December 31, 2018 and recorded a gain on extinguishment of liability of $1.5 million.  
 Competition 
 The cell therapy and regenerative medicine sector is characterized by innovative science, rapidly advancing technologies and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and intellectual property portfolio provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and regenerative medicine companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 
 The competitive landscape in the field of articular cartilage repair in the U.S. is emerging and has stimulated a substantial amount of interest from companies developing tissue repair solutions. Companies have employed a variety of approaches to meet the goals of cartilage repair. The approaches, which represent the scientific evolution of the field, can be generally categorized in five ways: (1) non-cell-based, such as Arthrosurface’s HemiCAP and Anika’s Hyalofast; (2) uncultured cell-based (with or without scaffold), such as Zimmer’s DeNovo NT, Arthrex’s BioCartilage and Osiris’ Cartiform, distributed exclusively with Arthrex; (3) cultured cell-based (without scaffold), such as ISTO’s RevaFlex; (4) cultured cell- and scaffold-based, such as Vericel’s MACI and the Aesculap division of B. Braun Medical’s NovoCart 3D; and (5) cultured cell- and scaffold-based incorporating tissue engineering, such as NeoCart.   
 In Japan, a historical cultured cell-based product, known as JACC is sold by Japan Tissue Engineering Co., Ltd (J-TEC).  This product has some of the same limitations of first-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation products in the U.S. including limited efficacy, lengthy surgery and extended patient rehabilitation.  Several cultured cell and cultured cell and scaffold combinations are in various stages of clinical development in Japan, with the earliest potential new competitive entries in 2023.

Government Regulation 
 Regulatory Background on Autologous Cellular Products 
 The FDA does not apply a single regulatory scheme to human tissues and the products derived from human tissue. On a product-by-product basis, the FDA may regulate such products as drugs, biologics, or medical devices, in addition to regulating them as human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), depending on whether or not the particular product triggers any of an enumerated list of regulatory factors. A fundamental difference in the treatment of products under these classifications is that the FDA generally permits HCT/Ps that do not trigger any of those regulatory factors to be commercially distributed without marketing approval. In contrast, products that trigger those factors, such as if they are more than minimally manipulated when processed or manufactured, are regulated as drugs, biologics, or medical devices and require FDA approval. The FDA has designated NeoCart as a biologic under the jurisdiction of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and market access or approval will require BLA approval. 
 In 1997, the FDA began requiring a BLA for autologous cellular products and approved the already-marketed Carticel contingent on further clinical trials. In 2000, Carticel’s indication narrowed to second-line therapy for patients with inadequate response to prior treatment. As of December 2011, the FDA requires evidence of clinical efficacy against approved and validated endpoints and standard of care control arm as outlined in their final guidance on the subject of cartilage repair. 
 The grant of marketing authorization in the European Economic Area (EEA) for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as NeoCart is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known and the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is required to provide an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA. 
 Applicants for marketing authorization for medicinal products in the EEA are required to submit applications for marketing authorization based on the ICH Common Technical Document and must demonstrate the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product for which the marketing authorization is sought. The application must include the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product. The conduct of clinical trials in the EEA is governed by Directive 2001/20/EC which imposes obligations and procedures that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The obligations provided in the European Union (EU) Good Clinical Practice rules and EU Good Laboratory Practice must also be respected during conduct of the trials. Clinical trials must be approved by the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place. Moreover, applicants are required to demonstrate that studies have been conducted with the medicinal product in the pediatric population as provided by a Pediatric Investigation Plan approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA. Alternatively, confirmation that the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral for the conduct of these studies must be provided. 
 Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any regulatory-approved products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care providers, and other organizations. Reimbursement policy involves coding, coverage and payment decisions and our business strategy is to produce the necessary information for optimal decision-making by payors. 
 Coding: While reimbursement policy for NeoCart is uncertain at this point, we believe that the existing Current Procedural Terminology, Healthcare Commission Procedure Coding System and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition coding options for ACI are sufficiently broad that they could apply to NeoCart. 
 11


Coverage: Our goal is to demonstrate improved health outcomes (e.g., improved patient outcomes and quality of life on several parameters, lower total costs including lower overall utilization of healthcare services and faster return to work) for patients receiving NeoCart compared to microfracture, an important element in securing coverage decisions by payors (Medicare and private payors). 
 Payment: Analysis of recent trends in ACI coverage (discharge data) suggest that patients between 18 and 64 years of age constitute the majority of the market for ACI, resulting in a market dominated by private payors. Only 10% to 20% of ACI patients are estimated to be 65 years of age and older. While limited data is available for private payor reimbursement of ACI, these payors typically reimburse inpatient procedures with bundling mechanisms similar to Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups. In addition, some private payors also tend to use Medicare rates as benchmarks when setting their own fee schedules. 
Government Regulation Overview 
 United States 
 Overview 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and related regulations. Biological products are also subject to other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biological products. These agencies and other federal, state, local, and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including clinical testing, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. 
 Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that the FDA or any other regulatory agency will grant approvals for NeoCart or any future product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of NeoCart or any future product candidates or approval of new disease indications or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative, judicial, or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. 
 Marketing Approval 
 The process required by the FDA before biological products may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests according to good laboratory practices, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCP), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use or uses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMP) to assure
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices (GTP) for the use of human cellular and tissue products to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, which must occur before a biological product can be marketed or sold.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. 
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, the clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an initial IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. Further, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study subjects and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA or IRB may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA or IRB authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA and IRB. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin or that, once begun, issues will not arise that will result in the suspension or termination of such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and to the IRB. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1—The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is conducted in patients. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—These trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | Phase 3—Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA now has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical trials to address safety issues. All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in: 
  
• | obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | reaching agreement with third-party clinical trial sites and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable trials on a timely basis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining IRB approval to conduct a trial at a prospective site;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | recruiting patients to participate in a trial; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | supply of the biological product.
--+----------------------------------

 Typically, if a biological product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with NeoCart, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biological product for the proposed indication. The application includes all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling, among other things. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee and after approval, an approved biologic will also be subject to a program fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, will be $2.4 million for 2018. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity, and biological product standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTP. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort. If the FDA determines the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will require the facility to take corrective action and provide documentation evidencing the implementation of such corrective action. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA and request additional testing or data. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a biological product outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the BLA. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the BLA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the BLA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification. 
 15


After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the biological product will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the BLA will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the applicant in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The testing and approval process for a biological product usually takes several years to complete. 
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs within ten months of the 60-day filing date and 90% of priority BLAs within six months of the 60-day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal data may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in the imposition of new restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, regulatory approval for NeoCart, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. 
 FDA Post-Approval Requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We may rely, in the future, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any future products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, by us or our suppliers, may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the 
 16


market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Labeling, Marketing and Promotion 
 The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of biological products, including direct-to-consumer advertising, promotional activities involving the internet, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a biological product that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to market a biological product only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety and risk information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, seizures, potential civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs. 
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 
 In the United States, the research, manufacture, distribution, sale and promotion of biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other federal, state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, and the Veterans Health Care Act. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a biological product manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or order of an item for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. 
 17


The False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including biological products, that are false or fraudulent. Although we likely would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act. 
 There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, beginning in August 2013, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities. 
 Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
EU and EEA 
 Marketing authorization in the EU for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as NeoCart is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC establishes specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the EMA which is required to provide an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA. 
 Applicants for marketing authorizations for medicinal products in the EEA are required to submit applications for marketing authorization in a form that is based on the ICH Common Technical Document, and must demonstrate the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product for which the marketing authorization is sought. The application must include the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product. 
 The conduct of clinical trials in the EEA is governed by Directive 2001/20/EC which imposes obligations and procedures that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The EU Good Clinical Practice rules and EU Good Laboratory Practice obligations must also be respected during conduct of the trials. Clinical trials must be approved by the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place. 
 Moreover, applicants are required to provide evidence that studies have been conducted with the medicinal product in the pediatric population as provided by a Pediatric Investigation Plan approved by the Pediatric Committee of the 
 18


EMA. Alternatively, confirmation that the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral for the conduct of these studies must be provided. Cell-based products must also comply with Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March 31, 2004 on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells (Tissues and Cells Directive). This Directive describes the conditions and quality requirements which must be applied when sourcing the cells intended for manufacturing of the cell-based medicinal product. The EU Member States have transposed the Tissues and Cells Directive into their national laws. 
 Locally different interpretations of the Tissue and Cells Directive have occurred during adoption of the national legal implementations by individual EU Member States. This has led to some inconsistency of approach leading to additional complexity in complying with the all-over requirements in this already difficult regulatory field. 
 Given the specific nature of cell-based products, the clinical development paths are less standardized than for classic pharmaceutical or biological products. Phase 1 studies are often not relevant, in particular for autologous cell-based products, since cells often need to be directly implanted into a tissue defect only present in patients. As cellular therapy Phase 3 studies are very complex to organize, often limited numbers of patients can be enrolled and follow up times can be very long, so that the design and execution of these large confirmatory trials might not always be possible to the classical extent. Upfront discussions and agreement with the regulatory authorities are an important criterion to success. It is also expected that new regulatory guidance will become available in the near future, more clearly describing the regulatory expectations. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 49 full-time employees, including four in research and development, seven in clinical development and regulatory, 29 in manufacturing and quality control and assurance, and nine in executive, general and administrative. In January 2019 and March 2019, we implemented restructuring plans approved by our Board involving reductions in headcount to reduce operating costs and conserve cash, along with other cash conservation measures. The positions eliminated together represented all but one member of our workforce, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Business Officer. We intend to engage, Mr. Adam Gridley, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stephen Kennedy, our Chief Operating Officer, along with up to four additional employees as consultants to assist with our continuing evaluation of strategic alternatives. Mr. Gridley will retain his statutory titles of president, treasurer and secretary of the Company while he continues to provide consulting services to us, and will remain a director of the Company. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements.
