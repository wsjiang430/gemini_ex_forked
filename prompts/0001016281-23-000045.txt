ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
GENERAL
Carriage Services, Inc. (“Carriage,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 1993 and is a leading provider of funeral and cemetery services and merchandise in the United States. We operate in two business segments: Funeral Home Operations, which currently accounts for approximately 70% of our total revenue, and Cemetery Operations, which currently accounts for approximately 30% of our total revenue. 
At December 31, 2022, we operated 171 funeral homes in 26 states and 32 cemeteries in 11 states. We compete with other publicly held and independent operators of funeral and cemetery companies. We believe we are a market leader in most of our markets. 
Funeral home and cemetery businesses provide products and services to families in three principal areas: (i) ceremony and tribute, generally in the form of a funeral or memorial service; (ii) disposition of remains, either through burial or cremation; and (iii) memorialization, generally through monuments, markers or inscriptions. Our funeral homes offer a complete range of services to meet a family’s funeral needs, including consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and memorial services and transportation services. Most of our funeral homes have a non-denominational chapel on the premises, which permits family visitation and services to take place at one location and thereby reduces transportation costs and inconvenience to the family.
Our cemeteries provide interment rights (primarily grave sites, lawn crypts, mausoleum spaces and niches), related cemetery merchandise (such as memorial markers, outer burial containers and monuments) and services (interments, inurnments and installation of cemetery merchandise). 
We provide funeral and cemetery services and products on both an “atneed” (time of death) and “preneed” (planned prior to death) basis.
CURRENT YEAR DEVELOPMENTS
Executive Leadership Changes
On April 1, 2022, Rob Franch joined our executive leadership team as Chief Information Officer. 
On September 26, 2022, Robbie Pape joined our executive leadership team as Senior Vice President and Regional Partner.
On September 27, 2022, C. Benjamin Brink informed the Company of his plans to resign from his position as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective January 2, 2023. Mr. Brink remained in his role through January 2, 2023 and will serve as a consultant for the Company through June 30, 2023. The planned resignation was not the result of any disagreement Mr. Brink had with the Company on any matter related to the Company's operations, policies, and practices, including any matters concerning the Company's controls or any financial or accounting-related matters or disclosures. 
On January 2, 2023, following the resignation of Carl Benjamin Brink, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (Principal Financial Officer) from the Company, our Board of Directors (our “Board”) appointed Adeola Olaniyan, the Company’s Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Office, as the Company’s interim Principal Financial Officer until a permanent replacement is identified. In this interim role, Ms. Olaniyan will serve as both the Company’s Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer.
Board of Director Changes
On February 22, 2023, our Board elected Carlos R. Quezada, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, to serve as a Class II director, effective February 22, 2023, until the Company’s 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. The Board also appointed Mr. Quezada to serve as Vice Chairman of the Board. Mr. Quezada will serve as a non-independent member of the Board, and the Board does not expect to appoint Mr. Quezada to any of its standing committees. Following the appointment of Mr. Quezada, the Board is now comprised of six directors, including four independent directors. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Amendments
On February 22, 2023, our Board, on the recommendation of the Board’s Audit Committee, approved various amendments to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”), which applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition to making certain technical and administrative updates, the amendments to the Code include, among other things, summarizing and clarifying the Company’s existing compliance 
requirements and also identifies and expands upon certain policies, including those related to bribery and kickbacks, antitrust, political activity and improper influence on auditors. The approval of the amendments to the Code did not relate to or result in any waiver, whether explicit or implicit, of any provision of the prior version of the Code.
Acquisitions
On August 8, 2022, we acquired a business consisting of two funeral homes in Kissimmee, Florida for $6.3 million in cash. On October 25, 2022, we acquired a business consisting of three funeral homes, one cemetery and one cremation focused business in the Charlotte, North Carolina area for $25.0 million in cash.
Divestitures
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold real property for $3.3 million and four funeral homes for $1.5 million for a net gain of $0.7 million.
On January 31, 2023, we sold one funeral home and two cemeteries in Marshall, Texas for $0.8 million.
Credit Facility
On May 27 2022, we entered into a second amendment and commitment increase to the Credit Facility with the financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. Pursuant to the amendment, the revolving credit commitment was increased from $200.0 million to $250.0 million.
On December 9, 2022, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Facility with the financial institutions party thereto, as lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The amendment provided, among other things, for an increase in the maximum Total Leverage Ratio and modifications to the permitted investments covenant, relating to the Company’s ability to make certain acquisitions.
For additional discussion about our Credit Facility, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Share Repurchase Program
On February 23, 2022, our Board authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to permit us to purchase up to an additional $75.0 million under our share repurchase program, in addition to amounts previously authorized. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we did not repurchase any common shares. At December 31, 2022, our share repurchase program had $48.9 million authorized for repurchases.
Business Impacts of COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was deemed a global pandemic and since then, the Company has continued to proactively monitor and assess the pandemic’s current and potential impact to the Company’s operations. Since that time, the Company’s senior leadership team has taken steps to assist our businesses throughout each phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, including updating our processes and procedures to comply with all regulatory mandates, along with keeping the health and safety of our employees and the families we serve our top priority. While we believe the country has begun to transition to a post-pandemic phase, we continue to monitor the situation and may make appropriate adjustments to our operations as necessary.
The overall macroeconomic impact from the pandemic to the deathcare industry may provide varying results as compared to other industries. Our industry’s revenues are impacted by various factors, including for example, fluctuations in the death rate, the number of funeral services performed, the average price for a service and the mix of traditional burial versus cremation contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to see the death rate normalize to pre-COVID-19 levels, which accelerated during the latter part of the year. Although deaths directly attributable from COVID-19 have now largely decreased to have minimal direct impact on the overall death rate, the overall death rate remains slightly higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. Regardless of these recent trends, our businesses have remained focused on being innovative and resourceful, providing families immediate service as part of the grieving process. 
Within our financial reporting environment, we have considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial results for the year have been made, but are complicated by the continued uncertainty surrounding the normalization of the death rate and the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ultimate impact. This includes the potential impacts of new variants of COVID-19, its sub-variants and any other new variants, and any resulting impacts from such variants. We do not believe we are particularly vulnerable to concentrations, with respect to geographic area, revenue for specific products or our relationships with our vendors. To date, we have not experienced any material supply chain impacts or disruptions from our vendors attributable to COVID-19 and we continue to receive reliable service.
We believe our access to capital, the cost of our capital, and the sources and uses of our cash should be relatively consistent in the near term. While the expected duration and potential future impacts of the pandemic are unknown, we have not currently experienced any material negative impacts to our liquidity position, access to capital, or cash flows as a result of COVID-19. For additional information related to our liquidity position, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to see deaths directly attributable from COVID-19 largely decrease to have minimal impact on the overall death rate, which accelerated during the third and fourth quarter. However, the overall death rate remains slightly higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period, and we are unable to predict or forecast the duration or variation of this increased death rate with any certainty. As a result, we experienced lower volumes, revenues, earnings and margins when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, but overall financial performance remains at or above prior reporting periods during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we expect these death rate fluctuation trends to continue, we will continue to assess these impacts, including the potential impacts of new variants of COVID-19, its sub-variants and any other new variants, and implement appropriate procedures, plans, strategy, and issue any disclosures that may be required, as the situation surrounding the pandemic and related regulatory mandates and restrictions, if any, evolves.
Inflationary Trends
Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we began to experience modest cost increases and surcharges from our vendors and suppliers on merchandise and goods due to broader inflationary, raw material cost increases, and global supply chain impacts. This trend in modest cost increases continued during the fourth quarter of 2022, with the Company experiencing, for example, higher costs related to full-time hourly base rates, utilities, funeral supplies, merchandise costs and insurance. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these cost increases and we expect these impacts to continue throughout the current year, the ultimate scope and duration of these impacts are unknown at this time. More broadly, the U.S. economy continues to experience higher rates of inflation, which has impacted a wide variety of industries and sectors, with consumers facing rising prices. Such inflation may negatively impact consumers or discretionary spending, including the amount that consumers are able to spend on our services, although we have not experienced such impacts to date and our industry has been largely resilient to similar adverse economic and market environments in the past. Although we expect these trends to continue throughout the current year, we will continue to assess these impacts and take the appropriate steps, if necessary, to mitigate these cost increases, if possible. 
OUR OPERATIONS
See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 21 for segment data related to our operations.
Funeral Home and Cemetery Operations
Our funeral home and cemetery operations are managed by a team of experienced industry and sales professionals with substantial leadership experience. 
Given the high fixed-cost structure associated with funeral home operations, we believe the following are key factors affecting our profitability:
•our ability to establish and maintain market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships;
•our ability to effectively respond to the increasing trends towards cremation by bundling complimentary services and merchandise;
•our ability to successfully execute our Standards Operating Model;
•our ability to control salary, merchandise and other controllable costs; 
•our ability to exercise pricing leverage related to our atneed business to increase average revenue per contract; 
•demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age, which impact death rates and number of deaths; and
•our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds and our securities portfolio within the trust funds, which would offset lower pricing power as preneed contracts mature.
Our cemetery operations are subject to many of the same profitability factors as our funeral home business, as well as the following key factors:
•size and success of our sales organization;
•local perceptions and heritage of our cemeteries;
•our ability to adapt to changes in the economy and consumer confidence; and
•our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds, finance charges on installment contracts and our securities portfolio within the trust funds.
Personalization and pre-planning continue to be two important trends in the funeral and cemetery industry, but the national trend toward more cremations may be the most significant. While this trend is expected to continue, other factors are expected to lead to rising industry revenue, including an increase in spending on additional or unique funeral and cremation services. Shifting preferences will likely continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations; as such, we are focused on educating and providing our cremation customers with additional services and products that are available. All of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services. While the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of an average traditional burial service, we have found that this revenue can be substantially enhanced by offering additional services and merchandise, including video tributes, flowers, burial garments and memorial items such as urns, keepsake jewelry and other items that hold a portion of the cremated remains. 
We believe the following are our key strengths for our funeral home and cemetery operations:
Market Leader. We compete with other publicly held funeral and cemetery companies and smaller, independent operators and believe we are a market leader in most of our markets. We focus on markets that perform better than the industry average and are less subject to material economic and demographic changes. 
High Performance, Decentralized, Partnership Culture. Our funeral homes and cemeteries are managed by entrepreneurially focused Managing Partners with extensive funeral and cemetery industry experience, often within their local markets. They are responsible for day-to-day operations and for growing the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive local teams. Our businesses are supported by a broader team of High Performance leaders across multiple disciplines in our support center located in Houston, Texas. This promotes more cooperation and synergy between our funeral and cemetery operations and supports the goal of market-share and volume growth in our most significant markets. We believe our decentralized and partnership culture is very attractive to owners of premier independent businesses that fit our profile of suitable acquisition candidates.
Flexible Capital Structure and Strong Cash Flows. We believe our capital structure provides us with financial flexibility by allowing us to invest our cash in growth opportunities, such as business acquisitions and cemetery inventory projects. While we reassess our capital allocation strategy annually, we currently believe that our financial goals will best be achieved by continuing to improve the operational and financial performance of our existing portfolio of businesses while selectively investing our cash in growth opportunities that generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. For additional information regarding our capital structure, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Strong Field-Level Gross Profit Margins. We believe we have strong field-level gross profit margins and this performance is a testament to the success of our business strategies. Our strong margins and the ability to control costs are important advantages in a business such as ours that is characterized by a high fixed-cost structure. We will continue to seek ways to improve our financial performance, and we believe that our Standards Operating Model will continue to yield long-term improvement in our financial results.
Integrated Information Systems. We have implemented information systems to support local business decisions and to monitor performance of our businesses compared to financial and performance standards. Additionally, we have innovative technological and digital tools that enhance our ability to serve our client families in a remote environment. To further enhance the services we provide to our client families, we have begun developing a multi-year strategy with a greater focus on leveraging technology, specifically with customer facing opportunities. All of our funeral homes and cemeteries are connected to our support center located in Houston, Texas, which allows us to monitor and assess critical operating and financial data and analyze the performance of individual locations on a timely basis. Furthermore, our information system infrastructure provides senior management with a critical tool for monitoring and adhering to our established internal controls, which is critical given our decentralized model and the sensitive nature of our business operations. 
Proven Leadership Team. Our leadership team, headed by our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Melvin C. Payne, is characterized by a dynamic culture that focuses on addressing changing market conditions and emerging trends in the funeral services industry. We believe our culture of emphasizing the 4E (Energy, Energize Others, Edge and Execution) leadership characteristics is critical and will provide an important advantage as the funeral and cemetery industry evolves. We are committed to continue operating an efficient organization and strengthening our corporate and local business leadership. 
Preneed Programs
Funeral and cemetery arrangements sold prior to death occurring are referred to as preneed contracts. We market funeral and cemetery services and products on a preneed basis at the local level. We operate under a decentralized preneed sales strategy whereby each business location customizes its preneed program to its local needs.
Preneed funeral or cemetery contracts enable families to establish, in advance, the type of service to be performed, the products to be used and the cost of such products and services. Preneed contracts permit families to eliminate the burden of making deathcare plans at the time of need and allow input from other family members before the death occurs. We guarantee the price and performance of the preneed contracts to the customer.
 Approximately 15% of our funeral services performed are funded through preneed contracts, which are usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the purchase of a life insurance policy, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. Insurance-funded contracts allow us to earn commission income to improve our near-term cash flow and offset a significant amount of the up-front costs associated with preneed sales. Trust funded contracts typically provide cash that is invested in various securities with the expectation that returns will exceed the growth factor in the insurance contracts. The cash flow and earnings from insurance contracts are more stable, but are generally lower than traditional trust fund investments. In markets that depend on preneed sales for market share, we supplement the arrangements written by our local funeral directors with sales sourced by our own sales counselors and by third party sellers. We sold 9,563 and 9,111 preneed funeral contracts, net of cancellations, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, we had a backlog of 100,861 preneed funeral contracts to be delivered in the future. 
In addition to preneed funeral contracts, we also offer “pre-planned” funeral arrangements whereby a customer determines in advance substantially all of the details of a funeral service without any financial commitment or other obligation on the part of the client until the actual time of need. Pre-planned funeral arrangements permit a family to avoid the burden of making deathcare plans at the time of need and enable a funeral home to establish relationships with a client that may eventually lead to an atneed sale.
Approximately 50% of our cemetery operating revenue is derived from preneed property sales. Our preneed cemetery strategy is to build family heritage in our cemeteries by selling property and interment rights prior to death through full time, highly motivated and entrepreneurial local sales teams. Our goal is to build broader and deeper teams of sales leaders and counselors in our larger and more strategically located cemeteries, including the development of standardized sales systems across our portfolio of cemeteries, in order to focus on growth of our preneed property sales. For example, during 2022, we continued to grow our cemetery sales and marketing team to develop and implement our standardized sales system. Cemetery merchandise and services are often purchased in addition to cemetery property at the time of sale. The performance of these preneed cemetery contracts is secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. General consumer confidence and discretionary income may have a significant impact on our preneed sales success rate. Cemetery revenue that originated from preneed contracts represented approximately 67% of our total cemetery revenue for both 2021 and 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had a backlog of 66,797 preneed cemetery contracts to be delivered in the future. 
Trust Funds and Insurance Contracts
We have established a variety of trusts in connection with funeral home and cemetery operations as required under applicable state laws. Such trusts include (i) preneed funeral trusts; (ii) preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts; and (iii) cemetery perpetual care trusts. These trusts are typically administered by independent financial institutions that we select. Investment management and advisory services are provided either by our wholly-owned registered investment advisory firm (“CSV RIA”) or by independent financial advisors. As of December 31, 2022, CSV RIA provided these services to approximately 80% of our trust assets, for a fee based on the market value of trust assets. Under state trust laws, we are allowed to charge the trust a fee for advising on the investment of the trust assets and these fees are recognized as income in the period in which services are provided. The investment advisors establish an investment policy that provides guidance on asset allocation, investment requirements, investment manager selection and performance monitoring. The investment objectives are tailored to generate long-term investment returns without assuming undue risk, while ensuring the management of assets complies with applicable laws.
Preneed sales generally require deposits to a trust or purchase of a third-party insurance product. Trust fund income earned, along with the receipt and recognition of any insurance benefits, are not reflected in our revenue until the service is performed or the merchandise is delivered. Trust fund holdings and deferred revenue are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, while our insurance funded contracts are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In most states, we are not permitted to withdraw principal or investment income from such trusts until the service is performed. Additionally, in most states, regulations require a portion (generally 10%) of the sale amount of cemetery property and memorials to be placed in a 
perpetual care trust. The income from these perpetual care trusts provides funds necessary to maintain cemetery property and memorials in perpetuity. 
For additional information with respect to our trusts, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 7.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our business strategy is based on strong, local leadership with entrepreneurial principles that is focused on sustainable long-term market share, revenue, and profitability growth in each local business. We believe Carriage has the most innovative operating model in the funeral and cemetery industry, which we are able to achieve through a decentralized, high-performance culture and operating framework linked with incentive compensation programs that attract top-quality industry talent to our organization. We also believe that Carriage provides a unique consolidation and operating framework that offers a highly attractive succession planning solution for independent funeral home owners who want their legacy family business to remain operationally prosperous in their local communities. 
Our Mission Statement states that “we are committed to being the most professional, ethical and highest quality funeral and cemetery service organization in our industry” and our Guiding Principles state our core values, which are comprised of:    
•Honesty, integrity and quality in all that we do;
•Hard work, pride of accomplishment and shared success through employee ownership;
•Belief in the power of people through individual initiative and teamwork;
•Outstanding service and profitability go hand-in-hand; and
•Growth of the Company is driven by decentralization and partnership.
Our five Guiding Principles collectively embody our Being The Best high-performance culture and operating framework. 
Our operations and business strategy are built upon the execution of the following three models:
•Standards Operating Model;
•4E Leadership Model; and
•Strategic Acquisition Model.
Standards Operating Model
Our Standards Operating Model is focused on growing local market share, providing personalized high-value services to our client families and guests, and operating financial metrics that drive long-term, sustainable revenue growth and improved earning power of our portfolio of businesses by employing leadership and entrepreneurial principles that fit the nature of our high-value personal service business. Standards Achievement is the measure by which we judge the success of each business and incentivize our local managers and their teams. Our Standards Operating Model is not designed to produce maximum short-term earnings because we believe such performance is unsustainable and will ultimately stress the business, which very often leads to declining market share, revenue and earnings. 
Important elements of our Standards Operating Model include:
•Balanced Operating Model – We believe a decentralized structure works best in the funeral and cemetery industry. Successful execution of our Standards Operating Model is highly dependent on strong local leadership, intelligent risk taking, entrepreneurial drive and corporate support aligned with the key drivers of a successful operation organized around three primary areas - market share, high-value services and operating financial metrics.
•Incentives Aligned with Standards – Empowering local managers, who we call Managing Partners, to do the right things in their operations and local communities, and providing appropriate support with operating and financial practices, will enable long-term growth and sustainable profitability. Each Managing Partner participates in a variable bonus plan whereby he or she earns a percentage of his or her respective business’ earnings based upon the actual standards achieved as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standards. 
•The Right Local Leadership – Successful execution of our operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership as defined by our 4E Leadership Model, intelligent risk taking and entrepreneurial empowerment. A Managing Partner’s performance is judged according to achievement of the standards for that business.
4E Leadership Model
Our 4E Leadership Model requires strong local leadership in each business to grow an entrepreneurial, decentralized, high-value, personal service and sales business at sustainable profit margins. Our 4E Leadership Model is based upon principles established by Jack Welch during his tenure at General Electric, and is based upon 4E qualities essential to succeed in a high-performance culture: Energy to get the job done; the ability to Energize others; the Edge necessary to make difficult decisions; and the ability to Execute and produce results. To achieve a high level within our Standards in a business year after year, we require our Managing Partners that have the 4E Leadership skills to entrepreneurially grow the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive local teams. 
Strategic Acquisition Model
Our Standards Operating Model led to the development of our Strategic Acquisition Model, which guides our acquisition strategy. We believe that both models, when executed effectively, will drive long-term, sustainable increases in market share, revenue, earnings and cash flow. We believe a primary driver of higher revenue and profits in the future will be the execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model using strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition candidates. As we execute this strategy over time, we expect to acquire larger, higher margin strategic businesses. 
We have learned that the long-term growth or decline of a local branded funeral and cemetery business is reflected by several criteria that correlate strongly with five to ten year performance in volumes (market share), revenue and sustainable field-level earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margins (a non-GAAP measure). We use criteria such as cultural alignment, volume and price trends, size of business, size of market, competitive standing, demographics, strength of brand and barriers to entry to evaluate the strategic position of potential acquisition candidates. Our financial valuation of the acquisition candidate is then determined through the application of an appropriate after-tax cash return on investment that exceeds our cost of capital.
Our belief in our Mission Statement and Guiding Principles and proper execution of the three models that define our strategy have given us a competitive advantage in every market where we compete. We believe that we can execute our three models without proportionate incremental investment in our consolidation platform infrastructure and without additional fixed regional and corporate overhead. This gives us a competitive advantage that is evidenced by the sustained earning power of our portfolio as defined by our EBITDA margin. 
COMPETITION
The operating environment in the funeral and cemetery industry has been highly competitive. The largest publicly held operators, in terms of revenue, of both funeral homes and cemeteries with operations in the United States are Service Corporation International (“SCI”), Park Lawn Corporation (“Park Lawn”) and Carriage. We believe these three companies collectively represent approximately 20% of funeral and cemetery revenue in the United States. Independent businesses, along with a few privately-owned consolidators, represent the remaining amount of industry revenue, accounting for an estimated 80% share of revenue. 
Our funeral home and cemetery operations face competition in the markets that they serve. Our primary competition in most of our markets is from local independent operators. We have observed new start-up competition in certain areas of the country, which may impact our profitability in certain markets. Market share for funeral homes and cemeteries is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important. Because of the importance of reputation and heritage, market share increases are usually gained over a long period of time. The sale of preneed funeral services and cemetery property has increasingly been used by many companies as a marketing tool to build market share.
There has been increasing competition from providers specializing in specific services, such as cremations, who offer minimal service and low-end pricing. We also face competition from companies that market products and related merchandise over the internet and non-traditional casket stores in certain markets. These competitors have been successful in capturing a portion of the low-end market and product sales.
SEASONALITY
Our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate and may be further affected by epidemics and pandemics, like COVID-19. Generally, the number of deaths is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year. For example, we experienced fluctuations in the death rate due to COVID-19, with a result of increased deaths during the duration of the pandemic. Although deaths directly attributable from COVID-19 have now largely decreased to have minimal direct impact on the overall death rate, 
the overall death rate remains higher than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. As a result, we are unable to predict or forecast the duration or variation of this increased death rate with any certainty. 
REGULATION
General. Our operations are subject to regulations, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trust funds, preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services and various other aspects of our business. We believe that we comply in all material respects with the provisions of these laws, ordinances and regulations. Legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material impact on our business. We cannot predict the impact of any future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations.
Federal Trade Commission. Our funeral home operations are comprehensively regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral industry promulgated thereunder referred to as the “Funeral Rule.” The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized pricing information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: (i) misrepresenting legal, crematory and cemetery requirements; (ii) embalming for a fee without permission; (iii) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; (iv) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services; (v) misrepresenting state and local requirements for an outer burial container; and (vi) representing that funeral goods and services have preservative and protective value. Additionally, the Funeral Rule requires the disclosure of mark-ups, commissions, additional charges and rebates related to cash advance items. On October 20, 2022, the FTC announced that it was retaining the Funeral Rule and issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking concerning potential amendments to the Funeral Rule. These potential amendments include, among other things, whether and how funeral providers should be required to display or attribute their price information online and through electronic means. On December 21, 2022, the FTC voted to extend the public comment period to January 17, 2023 for its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on potential amendments to the Funeral Rule. We cannot predict what changes, if any, may be made to the Funeral Rule or the impact of any such changes on our business.
State Trust Laws. We have established a variety of trusts in connection with funeral home and cemetery operations as required under applicable state laws. Such trusts include (i) preneed funeral trusts; (ii) preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts; and (iii) cemetery perpetual care trusts. These trusts are typically administered by independent financial institutions which we select. Under state trust laws, our wholly owned registered investment advisor is allowed to charge the trust a fee for advising on the investment of the trust assets and these fees are recognized as income in the period in which services are provided. Preneed funeral sales generally require deposits to a trust or purchase of a third-party insurance product. In most states, we are not permitted to withdraw principal or investment income from such trusts until the funeral service is performed. Some states, however, allow for the retention of a percentage (generally 10%) of the receipts to offset any administrative and selling expenses. Additionally, we are generally required under applicable state laws to deposit a specified amount (which varies from state to state, generally 50% to 100% of the selling price) into a merchandise and service trust fund for preneed cemetery merchandise and services sales.
Environmental. Our operations are also subject to certain federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing air emissions, waste management and disposal and wastewater discharges. For instance, the federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws, which restrict the emission of pollutants from many sources, including crematories, may require us to apply for and obtain air emissions permits, install costly emissions control equipment, and conduct monitoring and reporting tasks. Also, in the course of our operations, we store and use chemicals and other regulated substances as well as generate wastes that may subject us to strict liability under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state laws, which govern the treatment, storage, and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes, and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes cleanup obligations on current and past owners or operators of facilities where hazardous substance releases occurred and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of hazardous substances released into the environment from such sites. In addition, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws regulate discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters. Underground and above ground storage tanks that store chemicals and fuels for vehicle maintenance or general operations are located at certain of our facilities and any spills or releases from those facilities may cause us to incur remedial liabilities under the Clean Water Act or analogous state laws as well as potential liabilities for damages to properties or persons. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, delays in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in affected areas. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure that we will not incur 
significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damages to property, natural resources or persons. Also, it is possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental requirements could result in additional, currently unidentifiable costs or liabilities to us, such as requirements to purchase pollution control equipment or implement operational changes or improvements. While we believe we are in compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure that we will not incur substantial costs in the future.
Worker Health and Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
HUMAN CAPITAL 
Our funeral homes and cemeteries are managed by entrepreneurially focused Managing Partners with extensive funeral and cemetery industry experience. They have responsibility for day-to-day operations and follow operating and financial metrics called “Standards” within our Standards Operating Model. Standards Achievement is the measure by which we judge the Managing Partner's performance and how we incentivize our Managing Partners and their teams. To achieve a high level within our Standards in a business year after year, we require local Managing Partners that have the 4E Leadership skills to entrepreneurially grow the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive local teams. See Part I, Item 1, Business Strategy for additional details about our Standards Operating Model and 4E Leadership Model. Additionally, we utilize short-term and long-term incentive performance programs to attract and retain talent in critical positions, ranging from sales counselors and sales managers to Houston support center leaders and employees. 
As of December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries employed 2,553 employees, of whom 1,174 were full-time and 1,379 were part-time. All of our funeral directors and embalmers possess licenses required by applicable regulatory agencies. None of our employees are represented by unions.
