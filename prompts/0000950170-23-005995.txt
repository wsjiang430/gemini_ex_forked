Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a leading provider of cloud-based bill payment technology and solutions. We deliver our next-generation product suite through a modern technology stack to more than 1,900 biller business and financial institution clients. Our platform was used by approximately 27 million consumers and businesses in North America in December 2022 to pay their bills, make money movements and engage with our clients. We serve billers of all sizes that primarily provide non-discretionary services across a variety of industry verticals, including utilities, financial services, insurance, government, telecommunications and healthcare. We also serve financial institutions by providing them with a modern platform that their customers use for bill payment, account-to-account transfers and person-to-person transfers. By powering this comprehensive network of billers and financial institutions, each with their own set of bill payment requirements, we believe we have created an enviable feedback loop that enables us to continuously drive innovation, grow our business and uniquely improve the electronic bill payment experience for participants in the bill payment ecosystem.
 Our platform provides our clients with easy-to-use, flexible and secure electronic bill payment experiences powered by an omni-channel payment infrastructure that allows consumers to pay their bills using their preferred payment type and channel. Because our biller platform is developed on a single code base and leverages a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, infrastructure, we can rapidly deploy new features and tools to our entire biller base simultaneously. Through a single point of integration to our billers’ core financial and operating systems, our mission-critical solutions provide our billers with a payments operating system that helps them collect revenue faster and more profitably and empower their consumers with the information and transparency needed to control their finances.
 We extend our platform’s reach through our Instant Payment Network®, or IPN. This is a proprietary network, consisting of tens of thousands of billers, that connects our integrated billing, payment and reconciliation capabilities with our IPN partners’ platforms. Our IPN enables our partners, which include leading consumer technology providers, retailers and financial institutions, to access our next-generation electronic bill payment technology using the same integrated platform we provide directly to our billers. By being connected to our IPN, our IPN partners provide their consumers with the full capabilities of our next-generation product suite, including the ability to engage with and make payments to our large and growing base of billers. Those partners in turn expand our platform’s reach to millions of additional consumers in the United States and globally.
Today, many billers and financial institutions rely on legacy bill payment systems that offer limited functionality, flexibility and extensibility. Billers traditionally rely on non-integrated multi-vendor solutions, which force consumers into a decentralized and fragmented experience. Similarly, financial institutions often lack the ability to view billing details or obtain payment confirmation and limit payment types to their own checking accounts. These legacy solutions result in inefficiencies in consumer communication, electronic bill presentment and payment capture, which we believe hinder a biller’s ability to create a holistic and accurate perspective on its cash flow. For financial institutions, the inadequacies of legacy solutions can have a negative impact on digital engagement, retention and cross-selling.
 We address these inefficiencies through our cloud-native, integrated single-vendor solution. Our platform supports omni-channel, electronic bill payments across multiple commerce channels, including online, mobile, interactive voice response, or IVR, call center, chatbot and voice-based assistants. As we do not charge development or implementation fees to billers, there is no minimum investment necessary for billers to achieve efficiencies from the use of our platform to replace some or all of their legacy bill payment systems or biller-direct solutions. We simplify how bills are paid and help billers collect revenue faster and more profitably because our platform is:
 •Scalable: Enterprise-grade platform capable of supporting transaction growth for billers and financial institutions of all sizes across numerous industry verticals. 
 •Innovative: Artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, or ML, algorithms power an omni-channel, end-to-end solution that adapts to new technologies and continuously learns from transaction activity.
 •Flexible: Platform accessible through an array of application program interfaces, or APIs, software development kits, iFrames and fully hosted solutions that provide complete control over the user experience. 
 •Configurable: Reconfigurable business logic that allows us to quickly implement new functionality required by new and existing billers.


•Integrated: Our library of over 400 integrations to core accounting software systems, including customer information systems, or CIS (which are software systems used to efficiently manage customer processes and data and often include bill pay, customer service and forecasting and analytics tools), and enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems (which are software systems used to collect, store, manage and interpret data from many business activities, typically including accounting systems); as well as core financial institution processing platforms and certain digital banking providers, helps connect disparate systems across the electronic bill payment value chain.
 •Extensible: Adaptable to new technologies and emerging payment channels, such as pay-by-text, AI-based virtual assistants and social media payments.
 •Secure: Multi-layer intrusion detection and prevention system, multi-factor authentication and encryption and tokenization designed for trust and security of transaction activity and information.
 We seek to enhance our biller network to gain market share. We believe our ability to seamlessly serve billers, financial institutions, partners and consumers uniquely positions us at the center of a multi-sided network and enables us to drive a powerful, and accelerating, flywheel effect. Our robust platform attracts billers, financial institutions and partners seeking to build stronger relationships with their consumers. Adding more billers, financial institutions and partners extends our platform’s reach to more consumers. These consumers drive more transactions to our platform, which strengthens biller, financial institution and partner retention and in turn accelerates our organic growth. As we scale, we seek to drive increases in our operating leverage, which in turn is expected to enable higher profitability and more efficient biller, financial institution and partner acquisition.
 We rely on a diversified go-to-market strategy including direct sales, software and strategic partnerships, resellers and our IPN. While the direct sales channel is an important part of our business, we also rely on our software and strategic partners and resellers to deliver our solutions to our billers and financial institutions. Our software partners, such as Oracle, integrate our platform into their software products enabling us to power their bill payment capabilities. Our strategic partners, such as JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank, and a major payroll solutions provider, refer new billers to our platform and in many cases we jointly sell to prospective customers with our strategic partners. Some of our strategic partners, particularly banks, also integrate our solutions into their platforms to provide an integrated bill presentment and omni-channel bill payment solution to their customers, and as such they are also IPN partners.
 Our IPN promotes more rapid adoption of our platform through partnerships with leading business networks, including:
 •Banking Partners: We modernize the bill payment infrastructure of banks and credit unions of all sizes, empowering their digital banking consumers with fast, secure and omni-channel payment technology by seamlessly integrating our solution into their digital platforms.
 •eCommerce Partner: We power electronic bill payments through the mobile app and AI-assistant voice service of a leading global ecommerce retailer, enabling millions of its users to retrieve information about, and pay, their bills for all billers on our network.
 •PayPal: We enable PayPal’s U.S. consumers to pay their bills directly from PayPal apps.
 •Other Partners: Other partners benefit from our IPN in a variety of ways, such as enabling bill payment for consumers across the U.S. For example, we enable Walmart's consumers to pay their bills either in-store at retail locations or online via Walmart's retail websites or mobile apps, and enable in-person cash payments at more than 90,000 retail locations in the Green Dot network.
  Industry Overview
 We believe the bill payment industry is undergoing technological transformation as consumers, billers and financial institutions demand a straightforward and streamlined approach to electronic bill presentment and payment and consumer engagement. The following key trends are currently defining the industry:
Electronic Bill Payment Requires an Integrated, Single-vendor Solution
 As electronic bill payments continue to evolve with consumer preferences, billers and financial institutions demand an integrated single-vendor solution suite to remain competitive. A typical electronic bill payment experience requires the coordination of multiple vendors for bill notification, presentment, various payment channels, call center support, and data and analytics. These vendors lack integration, which results in a fragmented consumer experience and increased cost to the biller. Billers and financial institutions that are able to access a single, integrated end-to-end solution are able to provide a seamless experience for their consumers.
Billers and Consumers Are Underserved by Financial Institutions
Traditional financial institutions have been slow to adopt modern digital bill payment technologies and the legacy providers which the financial institutions rely on have failed to innovate. Over the last decade, U.S. online consumer bill payment volume made through a bank’s bill payment solution has decreased significantly. We believe this reduction is driven by consistent under-investment by financial institutions and legacy providers in their bill payment platforms, resulting in a poor consumer experience. Generally, consumers must manually add billers to a financial institution’s system and are generally limited to automated clearing house, or ACH, or other legacy payment channels rather than omni-channel payment capabilities. Ultimately, the lack of optionality and transparency inherent to a financial institution’s bill payment solutions creates an opportunity that we seek to address.
Emerging Payment Options Through Online and Mobile Channels Are Transforming the Market
 Consumers are transacting anywhere and everywhere and through different channels. With the widespread use of mobile phones and home computers, consumer devices are becoming the aggregation point for billing information. As consumers move beyond paper checks and adopt emerging payment technologies, we believe the continued digitization of the bill payment industry will manifest through increased adoption of technologies such as pay by text, digital wallets and AI-based assistants. The emergence of these new technologies unlocks previously untapped opportunities to grow our network.
Data Is Being Underutilized
 Consumer bill payment transactions are rich repositories of data that can be used to significantly improve the electronic bill payment experience. We believe the bill payment industry has under-invested in the technology required to capture and analyze this data. As the industry continues to evolve around changing consumer preferences and the emergence of new payment technologies, data and analytics plays an increasingly important role in improving the full transaction value chain. Our proprietary transactional data creates workflow efficiencies and provides insights (such as payment methods depending on bill size and bill type) that strengthen the connection between billers and consumers.
Our Platform and Solutions
 Our biller platform is purpose-built to transform the way billers get paid and engage with their consumers. Our AI-driven SaaS platform provides a single-vendor solution that enhances the bill payment ecosystem with new functionality and added transparency. Our single code base architecture maximizes the inherent flexibility, extensibility and configurability of our solutions, which allows us to rapidly deploy our solutions to our billers.
 Our platform for financial institutions reconnects the financial institutions to their customers by providing a frictionless, real-time financial hub where consumers can consolidate their financial obligations, pay bills, move money in real time and deepen their understanding of their own financial position. Customers get a centralized viewpoint over all their money movement needs and the financial institutions get insights into their customers’ behavior than can inform a meaningful evolution of the customer experience.
 Single Point of Access
 APIs: Our easy-to-use APIs enable billers, financial institutions and partners to seamlessly access the entirety of our network through a single connection.
iFrames: Enables our billers, financial institutions and partners to exercise more control over the user experience by customizing the business logic to meet their specific requirements. Many of our billers who use iFrames have in-house IT resources but use our infrastructure for payment processing and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS compliance.
 Fully Hosted: We also provide a fully hosted alternative for our billers. In this option, our hosted platform provides our billers the full power of our platform without incurring the cost of using their own IT resources.
Technology Solutions
 Engagement: We believe billers must regularly engage with their consumers using actionable and contextualized data. Our smart notifications and messaging tools enable billers to provide billing details to their consumers, such as account status, and directly communicate with them over secure channels. Our engagement products help billers and financial institutions facilitate timely and secure bill payments, while driving digital adoption and reducing cost to serve.
 Presentment: Consumers are increasingly demanding omni-channel access to their bills through their preferred engagement channels. Our solution offers electronic bill presentment across numerous channels including web, mobile,

text, secure PDF, email, IVR, chatbot, social media and through our IPN partners. Our electronic bill presentment products help billers maximize their reach to accelerate revenue realization and engage consumers more efficiently.
 Empowerment: Our comprehensive suite of solutions empowers consumers and billers to customize, control and enhance the bill payment experience. Consumers can control communication preferences, multi-lingual capabilities, self-directed payment scheduling, multi-account management and dispute management. Billers are able to use automated case management and configurable reporting to quickly and comprehensively provide high-quality customer service.
Payment: We believe consumers demand an omni-channel payment experience that enables use of their preferred payment type and channel. Our secure and comprehensive omni-channel payment platform supports traditional and emerging payment technologies across multiple currencies and languages. Our platform supports electronic bill payments using credit, debit, ACH and digital wallets across a variety of payment channels, including web, mobile, IVR, text, secure PDF, chatbot, agent-assisted (call center), in-person, the AI-assistant voice service of a leading global ecommerce retailer, in Walmart and certain other retail stores, and through alternative payment rails such as PayPal. We support one-time payments, as well as future-dated, recurring and payment plan transactions.
 Intelligence: Electronic bill payment transactions contain a rich volume of consumer and behavioral data that can improve the bill payment experience for billers and consumers. Our AI-powered analytics engine produces data-driven insights on consumer preferences, channel usage, bill lifecycles, messaging effectiveness and paper suppression and can be used by billers to improve the consumer experience. For example, our analytics engine can analyze frequently asked questions to call centers and enable billers to quickly predict answers to those questions in the future, creating a better consumer experience with reduced cost to serve for the biller.
 Technology Architecture
 Single Code Base: Our extensible, cloud-based payments platform was built from the ground-up on a single code base with no versioning, which enables rapid deployment of new features and tools in part because there is no need to manage and reconcile separate versions of our software code. This flexibility empowers billers, financial institutions and partners across our network to offer their consumers the strength of our platform without paying us development or implementation fees.
 AI / ML: Our biller platform uses AI and ML algorithms to increase efficiency and extract data-driven insights from transactions and interactions between consumers, billers, partners and our platform. These algorithms are embedded within, and enhance, each of our technology solutions to deliver a more intelligent and predictive consumer experience.
Our Platform Features
 The electronic bill payment process involves more than just a payment. It requires an end-to-end engagement mechanism that facilitates communication and payment between billers, partners and consumers to ensure timely and transparent payment through a frictionless consumer experience. Various features of our platform support this:
Consumer Engagement: We enable our billers to improve their consumer engagement with targeted communications, such as smart notifications, broadcast messaging, inbound and outbound communications, and campaign management, all of which are managed by our communications management tools. Our engagement modules allow billers to communicate with consumers based on desired characteristics such as regional location, due date, account status (such as late payment), or custom logic. Our billers can also communicate new offerings, incentives for payment and new payment types (such as PayPal). In 2022, our billers sent approximately 145 million emails, sent 40 million text messages and had over 2 million IVR calls using our communications modules.
 Bill Presentment: Billers can present electronic bills and balance amounts through the biller’s own mobile app, text, secure PDFs, IVR, and chatbots or via alternative channels such as digital wallets, the AI-assistant voice service of a leading global ecommerce retailer, PayPal’s bill pay app, social media and our other IPN Partners.
 Consumer and Biller Employee Empowerment: We enable billers and financial institutions to empower both their consumers and employees, which significantly increases consumer satisfaction and on-time bill payment rates for many of our billers. Billers and financial institutions are able to empower consumers with an array of choices:
 •communications preferences – consumers can choose email, text, portal or otherwise;
 •language preferences – consumers can select their preferred language for receiving billing information and interact via IVR;
 •payment scheduling and type – consumers can schedule payments at specific times and use specific payment type to best suit their needs; and
 •multi-account management – consumers can manage multiple accounts with a single provider in one place. 


We offer complementary features to our biller’s employees, including tools for automated case management, configurable reporting and “see what they see” where the customer service employees can see exactly what the consumer sees to quickly resolve problems.
We have also made significant investments in research and development, including in an automated, streamlined onboarding experience to help our billers and financial institutions go live faster and in self-service features to help billers quickly adapt to consumer needs.
 Payment Types: We have significantly invested in innovative payment types to provide billers a seamless, omni-channel suite of tools. We believe no other provider in our markets offers a similar array of easy-to-implement options.
These features are seamlessly integrated with our engagement and empowerment tools to provide a superior consumer biller and financial institutions experience. Our platform supports a variety of payment types, including:
 •ACH and eCheck; 
 •debit card;
 •credit card; and
 •emerging payment types.
 Emerging payment types include PayPal, Venmo, PayPal Credit, Apple Pay, Google Pay and Amazon Pay. These payment types are gaining increasing traction with consumers, and as a result, are viewed as increasingly important by billers and financial institutions.
Payment Channels: Our platform offers an omni-channel payment infrastructure, which means that it enables bill payments through all the traditional payment channels billers and consumers expect, as well as many emerging payment channels. These include web portal, mobile, IVR, text, secure PDF, chatbot, agent-assisted (call center), in-person, the AI-assistant voice service of a leading global ecommerce retailer, in Walmart stores and through alternative payment rails such as PayPal. Key features and examples of several of these channels are described and illustrated in the following pages.
 Chatbot: Enable billers to engage with consumers through an automated, AI-powered interface that constantly improves the customer service experience through data-driven insights.
 PayPal App: Leveraging our APIs, PayPal’s U.S. consumers can pay their bills directly from PayPal.
 Secure Service: Our patented Secure Service feature enables billers to accept payments over the phone while minimizing PCI-DSS compliance risk. Many billers avoid accepting payment information over the phone by directing consumers to websites or automated phone systems, which creates poor experiences and results in abandoned payments. Our Secure Service allows the biller’s employee and the consumer to remain connected throughout the process, while removing the biller’s employee from PCI-DSS scope by concealing payment details. As a result, the transaction is able to be completed securely and the consumer can be returned to the same employee directly on completion.
  AI-assistant Voice Service: We power bill payments for the AI-assistant voice service of a leading global ecommerce retailer, enabling millions of its users to retrieve information about, and pay, their bills for all billers on our network using voice commands.
 Text-based: Pay by text leverages our text based bill presentment technology for a text payment authorization, which then uses stored payment types in the consumer’s account.
IVR: Interactive voice response is a powerful tool to make payments and check balances, and is available in multi-lingual options.
 Agent-assisted Call Center Payments: Our agent-assisted call center capability enables a biller to support and assist their consumers with bill payments and other related issues.
 Portal: Our bill payment portal enables billers to provide advanced usage and consumption data to their consumers such as power use by day.
 In-person Payments: We also power in-person payments, which include payments at kiosks or a counter for point-of-sale transactions. This is particularly appealing for many billers who may have a local customer service center.
 Payment Timing: We support an array of timing alternatives including one-time guest payments, recurring payments, future-dated payments, multiple payments and payment plans.
 

What Sets Us Apart
 Paymentus was built on the notion that existing bill payment systems are not equipped to handle how bills will be paid in the future. Our platform is a cloud-native solution that automates the entire bill payments lifecycle between billers and financial institutions and consumers through a single integration, simplifying how consumers pay bills and accelerating billers’ revenue recognition through the following characteristics:
•Scalable: Our mission-critical platform is designed to support high velocity throughput of daily, non-discretionary consumer bill payments. Our platform is capable of scaling up market to serve large billers, each processing payments for millions of bills per month, while also serving smaller billers, each processing payments for one bill per month. In 2022, we processed approximately 365 million payments and an average of one million payments were made each day using our platform.
 •Innovative: Our AI-enabled, SaaS architecture is the foundation of our unified platform. Our ML algorithms continuously learn and self-improve from transaction activity on our platform. Our platform and our intensely client-centric approach inform our product development strategy, enabling us to offer new features and functionality that improve our value proposition to our billers. 
 •Flexible: We support multiple integration modalities to enhance our billers’ and financial institutions' ability to consume the full breadth of our platform. Some of our billers and financial institutions use our APIs or iFrames, which offer more control over the user experience, but require our infrastructure for payment processing and PCI-DSS compliance. Other billers use our fully hosted solution because they lack requisite IT resources and must leverage our technology and customer support systems to offer an electronic bill payment experience. We also allow our billers financial institutions to adopt a hybrid approach that leverages our APIs for certain environments.
 •Configurable: Our platform can rapidly and cost-effectively reconfigure our business logic to accommodate the specific requirements of the different end markets we serve. In 2022, approximately 75% of new biller implementations were completed without any code changes or significant development costs. Once configured, we can use these solutions with new and existing billers to expand into new verticals and geographies. For example, in 2022, we extended our platform to support configurable payment plans for a biller in the healthcare vertical. Features deployed include, but are not limited to, early payment discounts based on business rules and permission-based negotiated payments. The capabilities have subsequently been leveraged to support use cases in other verticals and customer implementations without requiring code changes to our platform. By developing products through this platform approach, we believe we are able to drive additional growth and expand the reach of our platform efficiently.
 •Integrated: Our library of over 400 integrations to core accounting software systems, including leading CIS and ERP systems as well as core financial institution processing platforms and certain digital banking providers, helps connect disparate systems across the electronic bill payment value chain. Our billers gain access to the entirety of our biller platform through an easy-to-deploy, single point of access. These integrations allow us to own and control the key components of the electronic bill payment value chain, including accounting and back-end integrations to CIS and ERP systems. Our portfolio of integrations span hundreds of software versions – some of which are decades old but still in use today by many of our billers – which enables us to rapidly integrate with billers and financial institutions. We believe competitors would need to invest significant time and resources in order to replicate our software integration portfolio. 
 •Extensible: Our platform is designed to integrate with new payment and consumer engagement technologies as well as new software, strategic and IPN partners. For example, through integrations with PayPal and a leading global ecommerce retailer, we have extended our platform to hundreds of millions of new consumers who wish to interact with billers in the PayPal app or through the AI-assistant voice service of a leading global ecommerce retailer. 
 •Secure: Biller, financial institution, partner and consumer security is of paramount importance to our business. Our PCI-DSS-compliant platform offers an intrusion detection and prevention system, multi-factor authentication and encryption and tokenization capabilities. We enforce our security policies and procedures through regular internal and third party audits, 24/7 digital monitoring, continued education and sophisticated technology tools. 
Our Network
 We believe our innovative technology platform enables us to sit at the nexus of a powerful multi-sided network of billers, financial institutions, partners and consumers. We use the power of this network to enhance the number of product features each biller uses to promote transaction growth. Our portfolio data shows that payment adoption is highly

correlated to feature utilization. By increasing feature usage, we believe we will realize an increase in transaction volume from our billers.
Our Billers
 Our innovative technology platform empowers billers to offer electronic bill payment acceptance across multiple payment types, engage with their consumers and streamline their business operations efficiently and cost-effectively. We attract billers to our platform because our platform modernizes their payment infrastructure and helps them collect revenue faster and more profitably. Our platform is capable of posting payments directly to billers’ systems, which simplifies revenue operations and strengthens the relationship we have with billers.
Our Financial Institutions
 Our network connects our financial institutions to thousands of billers and sources of money movement including virtually every bank and credit union in the US, debit card and credit card payments and multiple digital wallets. The network also enables consumers to make loan payments to our financial institutions from our other network partners. By using open application programming interfaces, or APIs, software development kit, or SDK, widgets and single-sign-on, or SSO, interfaces, our financial institutions have complete flexibility and control over how they integrate and deliver their services including modern digital bill presentment, payment and money movement services.
Value Proposition to Billers and Financial Institutions
 Flexible and Integrated Platform: Billers and financial institutions can offer their consumers a variety of traditional and emerging payment and engagement technologies that enable the billers to collect revenue faster and drive improved customer satisfaction, while reducing costs such as their PCI-DSS compliance burden. Billers and financial institutions have the flexibility to integrate directly to our platform through APIs, iFrames or a fully hosted solution, which allows them to cost-effectively select and customize our solutions to fit their specific requirements. Because our platform is flexible and scalable, we believe our value proposition applies to all billers whether they ultimately choose to use our platform for all of their bills or continue using legacy bill payment systems or biller-direct solutions together with our solutions.
 Long-term Growth and Operating Leverage: The scalability of our platform allows billers and financial institutions to capitalize on growth opportunities for their business. While helping billers grow their revenue, we also help reduce costs by leveraging our integrated technology architecture to automate manual workflows, which reduces error-prone manual data entry and efficiently reconciles payments to backend financial and operating systems.
Our Partners
 As our biller base expands, we attract market-leading software, strategic and IPN partners that use our platform to power bill payment experiences within their ecosystems. Our innovative platform facilitates a modern bill presentment, consumer engagement and bill payment experience for our partners’ customers, regardless of partner type.
 Software Partners: Our software partners include large third-party technology providers, such as Oracle, which integrate our platform into their software suites to power bill payments for their customers and refer billers and financial institutions to us. For example, ERP providers integrate our platform into their own suite of solutions to offer a comprehensive solution set that enhances their ERP software with bill presentment, consumer engagement and bill payment capabilities. In certain cases, we have revenue sharing arrangements with our software partners based on our transaction fees. In other cases, rather than a revenue sharing arrangement, we and our software partner mutually benefit from the partnership as the software partner can offer a more comprehensive solution and stronger value proposition to its customers and we receive broader reach to potential billers and consumers, an efficient biller acquisition channel and stronger biller retention from an integrated solution.
 Strategic Partners: Similar to our software providers, our strategic partners refer billers to us and, in many cases, integrate our solutions into their platforms. Our strategic partners, including JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank, and a major payroll solutions provider, work with us to offer bill presentment, consumer engagement and bill payment capabilities to their customers, which are billers. For example, a large commercial bank has many business clients who seek to improve and streamline the bill presentment and bill payment experience for their consumers. In that case, the large commercial bank partners with us to sell a joint solution. In other cases, the commercial bank may prefer to sell a white-labeled solution, which it obtains from us. Both co-sale and white-label arrangements typically involve revenue sharing agreements with the strategic partner based on the transaction fees we receive.
 IPN Partners: Our IPN partners work with us to gain access to broader biller networks and provide their consumers with innovative technology to streamline bill payments. Our IPN partners include PayPal, for which we power bill payment capabilities, a leading global ecommerce retailer, through which we offer electronic bill presentment and payment via its AI-assistant voice service and mobile app, Walmart, for which we enhance in-person bill payment capability at Walmart

Money Centers, and Green Dot, to enable in-person cash payments at more than 90,000 retail locations in the Green Dot network. Unlike software and strategic partners, IPN partners typically have direct interactions with consumers, and leverage our platform to connect to our biller network. Through this connection, consumers can initiate bill payments through our IPN partners, which we route to the billers. There are many types of IPN partners, including consumer networks, retailers, banks and financial institutions. We offer consumer networks and retailers increased engagement with consumers by enabling streamlined bill presentment payment experiences for an array of billers through their networks. We similarly offer banks and financial institutions increased engagement with their retail clients. For IPN partners, we will typically receive a fee per transaction processed through our platform and in some cases we pay a referral fee to IPN partners.
 Multiple Roles for Partners: Notably, partners may fit into multiple categories, particularly banks and financial institutions. For example, a bank can be a biller, a strategic partner and an IPN partner. As a biller, the bank generates bills, such as mortgage and credit card statements. As a strategic partner, the same bank uses our platform to power an omni-channel bill payment experience for a commercial customer of the bank. In this way, that commercial customer becomes a new biller for our network. Finally, as an IPN partner, the same bank leverages our IPN network to enable a more robust bill payment experience for its business customers and consumers by, for example, enabling its business customers and those businesses’ consumers to pay bills using alternative payment channels, such as PayPal. For clarity, financial institutions may also be customers where the financial institution uses our platform to provide bill payment and other money movement services directly to consumers and businesses.
 Value Proposition to Partners
 Higher Consumer Satisfaction: Partners gain access to our network of billers and can provide turnkey electronic bill payment functionality to their consumers through flexible integration options. By integrating our platform into their ecosystems, partners can provide a more comprehensive solution and drive higher customer satisfaction.
 Access to Innovative Technology Solutions: As consumers demand a more seamless and secure experience, partners require consumer engagement and payment technology that caters to the latest consumer trends. Our platform offers cutting edge technology that enables partners to grow mind and wallet share with their consumers.
 Our Billers’, Financial Institutions' and Partners’ Consumers
 As our platform reaches more consumers, we capture and monetize more payment transactions. In December 2022, approximately 27 million consumers and businesses used our platform to pay their bills. As consumers increasingly demand omni-channel bill payment solutions for more of their bills, we attract more billers and partners who look to our platform to meet that demand.
Value Proposition to Consumers
 Next-Generation Electronic Bill Payment Tools: Consumers gain access to advanced payments functionality to streamline their omni-channel bill payment experience. Consumers can view and pay bills through a variety of payment channels and types, engage with their billers, financial institutions and retrieve actionable insights regarding their payments and billing history.
 Control Over Financial Health: Consumers gain added control and visibility over their financial health on a daily basis through the advanced tools and features we provide. Our platform allows consumers to set the terms of their bill payments in a way that best suits their needs.
 Growth Strategies
 We intend to leverage our products and industry presence to establish our platform as the industry standard for electronic bill payments for billers, financial institutions and partners globally. Key elements of this strategy include:
Continue to Win New Billers, Financial Institutions and Partners
 We believe the majority of billers and financial institutions use inferior electronic bill payment platforms. We plan to continue winning new billers, financial institutions and partners by investing in the growth of our IPN, expanding our diversified go to market strategies and strengthening our value proposition. We intend to continue winning market share through a superior product offering that is easy to integrate and provides a feature-rich experience for our billers, partners and consumers.
Grow with Existing Billers, Financial Institutions and Partners
 We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage the full scope of our highly scalable model to drive further adoption of our platform with existing billers, financial institutions and partners, including our IPN partners. We believe

adding product features and additional functionality enables us to capture more electronic bill payments, strengthens our biller and partner retention and ultimately generate more transaction revenue.
 Expand into New Channels and Industry Verticals
 We intend to leverage our platform to expand into new channels and new industry verticals. In particular, we anticipate growth of our IPN and additional partnerships with leading business networks to drive further expansion into new channels, such as PayPal’s bill pay app. We also intend to continue to cost-effectively expand into new verticals and expect that our expansion efforts will center on verticals with favorable bill payment characteristics such as recurring payments for non-discretionary, essential services, similar to our previous expansion into the healthcare and insurance verticals. Our configurability and platform approach to new feature development enables us to cost-effectively extend products that were initially designed for an existing vertical into powerful use cases for new verticals.
Build New Products
 We believe the significant investments we have made in our technology platform are a core differentiator of our business. As billers, financial institutions, partners and consumers adopt new consumer engagement and bill payment technologies, we intend to continue investing in our platform in order to create innovative features and add emerging payment types that further enhance the bill payment experience.
Leverage our Platform to Expand Internationally
We believe there is global demand for electronic bill payment technology among billers and financial institutions with international consumers and partners that serve international billers and financial institutions. Although substantially all of our revenue is generated in the United States, many of our largest domestic billers also serve billable consumers in international geographies and several of our domestic partners maintain international operations. We believe this presents us with a large opportunity to expand internationally without needing to significantly increase international headcount or retain local resources to initially serve international markets. Our international growth strategy is focused on leveraging our existing biller and partner relationships and we believe our platform is well-positioned to quickly adapt to local payment channels and regulatory schemes. In particular, we anticipate that our near-term international growth opportunities will come through our U.S.-based billers, financial institutions or partners seeking a technology platform to power bill presentment and payment in international markets within their existing industry verticals, as well as through our larger partners that serve international billers and financial institutions. We also expect to expand our existing presence in Canada and India over time, both within current and new industry verticals.
Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions
 We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our existing solutions, enhance our technology and increase the value proposition we deliver to our billers, financial institutions and partners and their consumers. For example, we may pursue acquisitions that we believe will help us expand within existing or new industry verticals and channels, accelerate our biller growth or enter new markets.
 Go-to-Market Strategy
 We employ a diversified go-to-market strategy that leverages targeted marketing efforts, a direct sales team and relationships with technology partners and resellers as we seek to acquire billers and financial institutions in an efficient manner. Our marketing strategy targets prospective billers and financial institutions through industry- and role-based marketing efforts at trade shows and industry events, direct marketing and social media programs. We also leverage partnerships and referral relationships of various types.
Our direct sales team is responsible for outbound lead generation, driving new business and helping to manage account relationships and renewals. Our sales team also maintains close relationships with existing billers and financial institutions and acts as an advisor to each biller to help identify and understand their specific needs, challenges, goals and opportunities.
 We also leverage strong relationships with our partners to extend the reach of our platform and receive new biller referrals. Our software partners, including Oracle, integrate our platform into their software products, enabling us to power their bill payment capabilities for their consumers. Our strategic partners, including JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bank and a major payroll solutions provider, also refer new billers to our platform. Our software is regularly integrated with our software partners’ offerings and with the software suites of other market-leading software providers commonly used by our billers, including SAP and Guidewire, in each case to power electronic bill payment functions for our billers and their consumers.


We also believe we benefit from the significant reach of our IPN. Through partnerships with PayPal, a leading global ecommerce retailer and financial institution partners, our platform reaches millions of consumers. Jointly delivering our platform with our software and strategic partners provides consistency of approach and a high-quality experience for billers, financial institutions, partners and consumers.
 Competition
 Our primary competition has historically been legacy solution providers and systems internally developed by financial institutions for bill presentment and payment services. The legacy solution providers have generally either served the financial services or the biller market individually. In both markets, legacy solution providers offer solutions for in-person cash payments, check-based mail payments, prior-generation IVR, phone-based payments and web-based payments, as well as a variety of point solutions for various payment needs. These solutions are often built via acquisitions and frequently not well integrated based on data architectures.
 In the financial services market, providers integrate into a bank’s online banking system. They offer access to a limited number of electronic bills, so only a fraction can be reviewed before deciding on payment. Once the consumer decides to pay the bill, the provider generally only allows for one type of payment, limiting the ability of consumers to use credit or other alternatives. The bank-based payments are slow, sometimes taking up to three days to reach a biller, so a consumer is not able to make a same-day payment.
 In the biller-direct market, legacy providers have been slow to respond to biller and consumer needs because their systems are expensive to maintain and are not nimble enough to keep up with the pace of innovation. As a result, they do not offer the breadth of channels and payment methods demanded by consumers, nor the integration and analytics capabilities required by billers. We also compete on pricing, particularly in certain lower-margin industries where lower cost pricing can outweigh higher product quality and an enhanced customer experience.
 We believe these solutions lack the modern infrastructure necessary to provide billers, financial institutions and consumers with an omni-channel electronic bill payment experience enhanced by AI, ML and contextualized data. We believe the strength and agility of our platform will drive our success in growing our business by demonstrating to billers, financial institutions and partners that our platform delivers superior business outcomes to those of third-party vendors or internally developed systems.
While competitive factors and their relative importance can vary, in general, we will be assessed on a number of factors including security, reliability, breadth and depth of functionality, ease of deployment and implementation speed, total cost of ownership and return on investment, customer satisfaction, customer service, partnerships, brand awareness and reputation and the ability to provide contextualized and actionable data-driven insights that improve the transaction experience. We believe we compete favorably on all of these factors.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and contractual rights, to protect our proprietary software and our brands. We have obtained or applied for patent protection in the United States on certain material aspects of our proprietary technologies and we have registered or applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license certain technologies and intellectual property from third parties, including software that is incorporated in our platform. We generally control access to and use of our software and other proprietary or confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with both our employees and third parties who have access to our software and other confidential information.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 22 issued U.S. patents and one issued Canadian patent related to our proprietary technologies. As of December 31, 2022, we also held one allowed, seven published and two pending U.S. patent applications, and three pending PCT patent applications. If our currently issued patents are maintained until the end of their terms, they will expire between 2025 and 2040. The expiration of these patents is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we owned 10 registered U.S. trademarks and one registered trademark in each of the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand and United Kingdom. We also held 10 pending trademark applications in the U.S., two pending trademark applications in each of China and India, and one pending trademark application in each of Australia and Canada.

Government Regulation
 Various aspects of our business and service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. Certain of our services are also subject to rules promulgated by various card and payment networks and other authorities, as more fully described below. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations and rules frequently change and are increasing in number.
 Our billers, financial institutions and partners and their consumers store personal and business information, financial information and other sensitive information on our platform. In addition, we receive, store, handle, transmit, use and otherwise process personal and business information and other data from and about actual and prospective billers, financial institutions and partners, as well as our employees and service providers. As a result, we and our handling of data are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, including regulation by various governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state, local and foreign agencies. Our data handling and processing activities are also subject to contractual obligations and industry standard requirements. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have also adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use, and storage of data relating to individuals and businesses, including the use of contact information and other data for marketing, advertising, and other communications with individuals and businesses. The legislative and regulatory landscapes for privacy, data protection and information security continue to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, with an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.
  In the United States, various laws and regulations apply to the security, collection, processing, storage, use, disclosure and other processing of certain types of data, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, and state and local laws relating to privacy and data security. Additionally, the FTC and many state attorneys general have interpreted and are continuing to interpret federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, processing and security of data. In addition, many states in which we operate have enacted laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal data, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in California. Certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations, such as in New York, Nevada, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, and all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and others. In addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, or EU, have established their own laws, rules and regulations addressing privacy, data protection and information security with regard to the handling and processing of sensitive and personal data obtained from their residents with which we or our billers, financial institutions or partners may need to comply. These laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, are in certain cases more restrictive than those in the United States. Because we process individually identifiable protected health information in certain cases, we are also subject to certain obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, as well as certain state laws and related contractual obligations.
 We are also subject to the rules and standards of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, the National Automated Clearinghouse Association, or NACHA, and INTERAC and other payment networks and their participants. In order to provide our payment processing services, we must be registered either indirectly or directly as service providers with the payment networks that we use. As such, we are subject to applicable card association and payment network rules, standards and regulations, which impose various requirements and could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by such associations or networks for certain acts or omissions. Card associations and payment networks and their member financial institutions regularly update and generally expand security expectations and requirements related to the security of consumer data and environments. Failure to comply with the networks’ requirements, or to pay the fees or fines they may impose, could result in the suspension or termination of our registration with the relevant payment networks and therefore require us to limit or cease providing the relevant payment processing services. It could also cause existing billers, financial institutions or partners, their consumers or other third parties to cease using or referring our services or prospective billers, financial institutions or partners to terminate negotiations with us.
 Further, we and our billers, financial institutions and partners are subject to a variety of U.S. state and federal laws, rules and regulations related to telemarketing, recording and monitoring of communications, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or CAN-SPAM Act and others, because our platform enables our billers and partners to communicate directly with their consumers, including via e-mail, text messages and calls, and also enables recording and monitoring of calls between our billers, financial institutions and partners and their consumers for training and quality assurance purposes.
 In addition to the laws and regulations described above, various regulatory agencies in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions continue to examine a wide variety of issues which are or may be applicable to us and may impact our business. These issues include payments, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules,

cybersecurity and marketing. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and several states have recently provided guidance or prohibitions against the use of convenience or similar “pay-to-pay” fees in certain industries that may impact us and our billers. The laws and regulations relating to financial services, privacy, data protection and information security are evolving, can be subject to significant change and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. As our business continues to develop and expand, including internationally, we continue to monitor the additional laws and regulations that may become relevant. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, including class action litigation, consent decrees and injunctions, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines, penalties, adverse publicity, reputational damage and constraints on our ability to continue to operate.

 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,260 full-time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
 Our employees are our most critical assets. The success and growth of our business depends on our ability to attract, reward, retain, and develop diverse, talented, and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization, while sustaining an environment of anti-discrimination that ensures equal access to opportunities. To succeed in an ever-changing and competitive labor market, we have developed human capital management strategies, objectives and measures that drive recruitment and retention, support business performance, advance innovation and foster employee development. Our human capital strategies and objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. We believe we provide our employees significant ongoing career growth opportunities in an exciting growth company and industry. The principal purpose of our incentive programs is to attract, retain and reward personnel in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We are also focused on supporting our employees’ health and safety and social well-being and seek to have a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace.
