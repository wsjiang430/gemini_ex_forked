Item 1. Business
OUR COMPANY
Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms “Comstock,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company” or “the Company” mean Comstock Mining Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The Company is a Nevada-based, gold and silver mining exploration, development and production company with extensive, contiguous property in the historic Comstock and Silver City mining districts (collectively, the “Comstock District”) and additional mining, commercial and industrial properties located in Storey and Lyon Counties, Nevada. The Comstock District is located within the western portion of the Basin and Range Province of Nevada, near Reno and Carson City. The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. Since then, the Company has consolidated a substantial portion of the historic Comstock District, secured permits, built an infrastructure and brought exploration projects into production. 
The Company and its subsidiaries now own or control approximately 9,358 acres of mining claims and parcels in the Comstock District and surrounding area. The acreage includes approximately 2,396 acres of patented claims and surface parcels (private lands) and approximately 6,962 acres of unpatented mining claims (public lands), which the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) administers. The Company's headquarters is in Gold Hill, Nevada, on a five-acre parcel at the intersection of American Flat road and State Route 342.

Because of the Comstock District’s historical significance, the geology is well known and has been extensively studied by the Company, our advisors and many independent researchers. We have expanded our understanding of the geology through vigorous surface mapping and drill hole logging. The volume of geologic data is immense, particularly in the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas. We have amassed a large library of historical data and detailed surface mapping of Comstock District properties. We integrate such data with information obtained from our recent mining operations, to target geological prospective exploration areas and plan exploratory drilling programs, including expanded surface and underground drilling.
The Company continues exploring and acquiring properties, expanding its footprint and evaluating all of our existing and prospective opportunities for further exploration, development and mining. The near-term goal of our business plan is to maximize intrinsic stockholder value realized, per share, by continuing to acquire and develop mineralized and potentially mineralized properties, exploring, developing and validating qualified resources (measured, indicated and inferred) and reserves (proven and probable) that enable the commercial development of our properties through extended, long-lived mine plans that are economically feasible and socially responsible, including mine plans for both the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas, with both surface and underground development opportunities. 
Our Dayton resource area and the adjacent Spring Valley exploration targets are located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately six miles south of Virginia City. Access to the properties is by State Routes 341 and 342, both paved roads. 
Our Lucerne resource area is located in Storey County, Nevada, approximately three miles south of Virginia City and 30 miles southeast of Reno. The Lucerne resource area was host to the Company’s most-recent test mining operations from 2012 through 2016. The heap processing facility for gold and silver is in American Flat, approximately three quarters of a mile west of the Lucerne mine. The heap leach facility was redesigned and expanded in late 2013 and again in the fourth quarter of 2014, to accommodate future production plans.
The Company achieved initial production and held its first pour of gold and silver on September 29, 2012. The Company ceased mining in 2015 and completed processing in 2016, and accordingly did not have any gold or silver production or mining revenue during 2017 or 2018. From 2012 through 2016, the Company mined and processed approximately 2.6 million tons of mineralized material, and produced 59,515 ounces of gold and 735,252 ounces of silver.
The Company's exploration and development activities to date have focused on less than 10% of our extensive Comstock District properties. We continue to develop longer-term exploration plans for additional exploration targets. In addition to targets in our Lucerne and Dayton resource areas, some of the more promising exploration targets include the Spring Valley group, Occidental group and Gold Hill group.
The Company’s real estate segment owns significant non-mining properties, including the Gold Hill Hotel, rentable homes and cottages in Gold Hill and Silver City, Nevada, the 225-acre Daney Ranch in Dayton, Nevada and a 98-acre, certified industrial park site in Silver Springs, Nevada, including senior water rights. The Gold Hill Hotel includes a historic, operating 
6

hotel, restaurant and bar. In 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to lease the Gold Hill Hotel to independent operators while retaining ownership. The initial term of the lease agreement was effective on April 1, 2015, and ends in March 2020. The tenant may renew the lease for two extended terms of five years each. Lease payments are due in monthly installments. 

Financial information for each of our segments is disclosed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Current Projects

The Company has identified many exploration targets on its land holdings in the Comstock District, but has focused, to date, on the Dayton resource area and the Lucerne resource area (including surface and underground exploration). We are working to develop comprehensive exploration plans for the remaining areas, which include the Spring Valley group, Occidental group, and Gold Hill group of exploration targets. Exploration activities will proceed subsequent to and in some cases concurrent with the ongoing exploration and development of the Dayton and Lucerne resource areas. 
 The Dayton resource area is south of Virginia City in Lyon County, Nevada. It generally includes the historic Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra patents, including the old Dayton Consolidated mine workings, south to where the Kossuth patent crosses State Route 341. The historic Dayton mine was the last meaningful underground mining operation in the Comstock District, before being closed after the War Production Board published Limitation Order L-208, 7 F. R. 7992 on October 8, 1942, that closed down all gold mining operations in the United States and its territories. The Dayton resource area ranks as one of the Company’s top exploration and potential mine development targets. In January 2014, the Lyon County Board of Commissioners approved strategic master plan and zoning changes on the Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra mining patents and other properties located in the Dayton resource area, enabling a more practical, comprehensive feasibility study for mining. Geological studies and development planning are currently underway utilizing data from extensive metallurgical testing and assessment during 2017, 30,818 feet of additional drilling completed in 2015, geophysical analysis and interpretation completed in 2013, and extensive geological data from pre-2013, drill programs.
The Spring Valley group of exploration targets lies adjacent to the Dayton resource area at the southern end of the Comstock District, where the mineralized structures, trending to the south from the Dayton resource area, lie mostly concealed beneath a veneer of sediment gravels. The area includes the Kossuth patented claim south of State Route 341, the Dondero patented property, the Daney patented claim, the New Daney lode mining claims, and the Company’s placer mining claims in Spring Valley and Gold Canyon.
The Lucerne resource area has been the primary focus of the Company’s exploration and development efforts since 2007. It includes the previously mined Billie the Kid, Hartford and Lucerne mining patents, and extends east and northeasterly to the area of the historic Woodville (southern-most of the historic Comstock bonanzas), Succor and Lager Beer patents and north to the historic Justice and Keystone mines. The Lucerne resource area is approximately one mile along strike, with explored widths from 600 to 1,800 feet, representing less than three percent of the land holdings controlled by the Company. The Lucerne is the site of our previous mining activities and ongoing exploration program, and the Company holds the key mining permits required to resume surface or underground mining of this area. 
Our Lucerne exploration activities included open pit gold and silver test mining from 2004, through 2006, and from late 2012 through 2016. As defined by the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, we have not yet established any proven or probable reserves at our Lucerne mine.
On October 3, 2017, the Company entered into an Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Tonogold Resources, Inc. (“Tonogold”). Under the terms of the Option Agreement, Tonogold has the right to lead in certain activities, including engineering, development, drilling and test-work, towards completing a technical and economic feasibility assessment on properties within the Lucerne resource area (the “Lucerne Property”). If all obligations and prerequisites are satisfied and subject to compliance with the Option Agreement, Comstock and Tonogold may effect a joint venture for the future development and mining of mineral resources in the Lucerne Property. 
Under the terms of the Option Agreement, Tonogold can earn a 51% interest in the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Comstock Mining LLC, which owns the Lucerne Property, by making $20 million in capital expenditures on the Lucerne Property within 42 months following signing of the Option Agreement. If Tonogold meets all of the prerequisites, Tonogold is also granted the option to purchase 51% of the Company’s American Flat property, plant and equipment for an additional purchase price of $25 million. Tonogold is in compliance with all terms of the agreement.
On January 24, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and received a $1 million non-refundable payment toward the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Comstock Mining LLC, which owns the Lucerne properties (~1200 acres) to Tonogold for $15 million in cash, relief of $8 million in future Northern Comstock LLC (“Northern Comstock”) lease and reclamation obligations, a permanent reduction of annual operating expenses by $1 million and a retained 1.5% net smelter return royalty on Lucerne. Upon closing, the Company will transfer the ownership of Comstock Mining LLC and hence control of the Lucerne properties, and related permits and retain ownership and/or control of the remaining land position in the Comstock district. The Company expects the transaction to close by May 31, 2019.

The Company and Tonogold also agreed that, upon the closing of the sale of the Lucerne mine properties, it will enter into a new Option Agreement to lease its permitted American Flat property, plant and equipment to Tonogold for crushing, leaching and processing material from the Lucerne mine. If the option is exercised, Tonogold will pay the Company a rental fee of $1 million per year plus $1 per processed ton, in addition to all the costs of operating and maintaining the facility, up to and until the first $15 million in rental fees are paid, and then stepping down to $1 million per year and $0.50 per processed ton for the next $10 million paid to Comstock, and then stepping down again, after the first $25 million of revenue is received, to $0.25 cents per processed ton, with no annual rental fee but with a $100,000 per quarter minimum revenue. Tonogold will reimburse American Flat expenses of approximately $1.1 million per year during the option life. 
Upon closing, these agreements will replace the October 2017 Option Agreement between the Company and Tonogold. The October 2017 agreement will remain in place until the sale of the Lucerne mine closes. Tonogold has met all the spending commitments to date and has been working with Mine Development Associates (“MDA”) of Reno to produce a new resource model and an NI 43-101 technical report on the Lucerne project. Tonogold reimbursed the Company $1.2 million during 2018, in addition to the $2 million received for the 2018 option payment and the $1 million non-refundable payment received on January 24, 2019. 
The Company, upon closing, will enter into a ten-year Mineral Lease for additional mineral properties in Storey County, Nevada, granting Tonogold the right to explore, develop and mine these properties. Tonogold will assume approximately $100 thousand in annual costs and will assume work commitments totaling over $200 thousand in 2019. Comstock will retain a 3% net smelter return royalty on these additional leased properties, which will be reduced to 1.5%, one year after the commencement of mining operations. The lease is renewable for an additional ten-year term.
The Occidental group and Gold Hill group of exploration targets represent longer-term exploration target areas that contain many historic mining operations, including the Overman, Con Imperial, Caledonia, and Yellow Jacket mines. We believe that our consolidation of the Comstock District has provided us with opportunities to utilize the historical information available to identify drilling targets with significant potential.

Government Regulation

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for substantially all of those licenses, permits, and other authorizations currently required for our mining, exploration and other development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations. Capital expenditures relating to compliance with laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, comprise a substantial part of our historical capital expenditures and our anticipated future capital expenditures. For example, we incur certain expenses and liabilities associated with our reclamation obligations. See “Reclamation” section below.
Reclamation

We are generally required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.

The Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 519A to 519A.280 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 519A.010 to 519A.415 promulgated by the Nevada State Environmental Commission and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”), Bureau of Mining and Reclamation (“BMRR”) require a surety bond to be posted for mining projects so that after completion of the work on such mining projects, the sites are left safe, stable and capable of providing for a productive post-mining use. Over the past four years, the Company has provided a reclamation surety bond, through the Lexon Surety Group (“Lexon”), with the BMRR. The BMRR, with concurrence from Storey County, has approved our most recent reclamation plan, as revised, and our estimated total costs related thereto of approximately $7.4 million, including, $7.1 million for BMRR and $0.6 million of additional reclamation surety bonding primarily with Storey County. 
As part of the surety agreement, the Company agreed to pay a 2.0% annual bonding fee and has signed a corporate guarantee. The cash collateral percentage held on deposit by Lexon is typically 32.7% or less of the current bond amount. The current bond amount with the State and County is $7.4 million and at December 31, 2018, $2.5 million of collateral was held on deposit.

Competition

We compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold and other mineral properties and the attraction and retention of human capital. Such competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do.
History

The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. The Company produced over 12,000 ounces of gold and over 53,000 ounces of silver from 2004 through 2006 from our Billie the Kid mine and American Flat heap leach processing facilities. Our test mining activities were concluded in January 2007, when based on our longer-term production plans, we prioritized land consolidation and mine planning. 
After five years of intensive geological mapping and interpretation, drilling, resource modeling and mine planning, the Company restarted mining operations in the third quarter of 2012 and resumed pouring doré bars of silver and gold in September 2012. The Company produced 59,515 ounces of gold and 735,252 ounces of silver from September 2012 through December 2016. The Company completed leaching from its existing leach pads in December 2016, and has since focused on exploration and development activities, primarily in the Lucerne and Dayton resource areas.
Customers

The Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. The real estate segment has numerous customers and is not dependent on any one customer.
