Industry Background
 
Biometrics is the measurement of unique, individual physiological characteristics, such as fingerprints, faces, irises, and voices that can be used to determine or verify an individual’s identity. The biometrics industry offers technology that digitally captures and encodes biometric characteristics and then compares those characteristics against previously encoded biometric data to determine or verify an individual’s identity. Biometrics addresses the limitations inherent in traditional identification and authentication processes, such as biographic data, tokens, paper credentials, passwords, PIN codes, and magnetic access cards. Biometrics technology and products require algorithms for multiple distinct functions, such as feature finding, feature optimization, feature extraction, feature encoding, feature matching, and presentation attack detection (“PAD”), which is also referred to as liveness detection and spoof detection.
Application Areas: Identification and Authentication
 
Applications for biometrics typically fall into two primary areas: identification and authentication. Generally speaking, biometric identification attempts to answer the question “who are you?”, while biometric authentication attempts to answer the question “are you the person we know?”
Biometric Identification
 
Biometric identification involves the “one-to-many” comparison of a “probe” sample to thousands or even millions of biometric samples in a database, comprising a search to determine which samples, if any, are associated with the individual that belongs to the probe. Biometric identification systems typically operate in a client/server architecture, with some systems migrating to web-based, thin-client architectures. Enrollment workstations with peripheral capture devices are used to enroll individuals into biometrics systems. Enrollment involves the capture, processing, and formatting of “biometric samples.” A biometric sample consists of biometric data which may include: i) images of fingerprints, faces, or irises; ii) digital voice signals; or iii) some other electronic representation of a biometric characteristic. Examples of capture peripherals include: i) scanners for fingerprint images, ii) cameras for iris and facial images, iii) handheld devices for mobile capture of fingerprint, iris, and facial images, or iv) mobile phones and/or microphones for voice signals.

After biometric samples are captured, they are transported in digital form to centralized matching systems for identification. Equipment used to perform these functions includes: i) servers to process and transport biometric samples; and ii) mainframe computers and servers to store and match those samples. In addition, military applications may employ handheld devices that are capable of capturing samples and matching those samples against sample databases that reside on the devices.
 
“Identity proofing” is a term used to describe a process by which identity information provided by an individual, such as a prospective customer or job applicant, is corroborated between multiple identity sources. Biometric identification can be used as part of identity proofing.
 
Biometric Authentication
 
Biometric authentication involves a “one-to-one” biometric comparison that serves to verify that a live biometric sample belongs to the same individual associated with a trusted stored sample. In this way, biometrics can be used to authenticate identity. Computing devices such as PCs, smartphones and tablets, are capable of: i) capturing biometric samples (e.g., fingerprints, facial and iris images, and voices); ii) processing and storing those samples in a secure area on the device or server; and iii) matching new live samples against the trusted stored samples. Once a biometric match is achieved, the subsequent software functions are analogous to password-based authentication. Mobile authentication can be implemented in either a device- or server-centric architecture, with biometric data analysis, matching, and storage occurring either on the device or on a central server, respectively.
 
“Tokens” are often used as an alternative or enhancement to passwords. An authentication token may be a hardware device that the user must have possession of to authenticate. Examples are a USB dongle, smart phone, or smart card. In the case of multifactor authentication, a device such as a smart phone or PC may be considered as a token providing the primary authentication factor, with biometric authentication serving as a second authentication factor. Mobile authentication can be incorporated into a mobile app such as a banking application as a password-free security mechanism. It may also be employed in an “out-of-band” fashion to secure access on a PC through a browser.
 
As biometric authentication is most typically an unattended process, some form of presentation attack detection (“PAD”) is an important feature of biometric authentication solutions. PAD features are designed to prevent “spoofing”, whereby a fraudster attempts to defeat a biometric security feature by impersonating the rightful user.
 
The rapid advance and adoption of mobile devices has had a substantial impact on the adoption of biometrics for authentication. Many leading mobile devices incorporate native biometric security sensors and technology, in which case third-party mobile applications are granted access to authentication results but not the raw biometric samples used to authenticate.
 
In contrast, third party application providers can incorporate authentication functionality that makes use of multipurpose sensors such as the camera, microphone, and touchscreen. There are use cases where it is desirable to implement biometric security features that are independent of those provided natively by the device. Advantages include more control over the security level, security features, and user experience, as well as uniform functionality across different device models. Biometric authentication implemented on a mobile device may be used to gain access to online networks, systems, services, or accounts.
 
User authentication enabled by smartphones continues to evolve, and we expect to see further advances in smartphone security features and functionality. In the past few years, the FIDO® (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, an industry consortium, has emerged to take a leading role in authoring and promoting technical standards for password-free multifactor authentication on mobile devices and desktops. The FIDO Alliance has developed specifications that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that supplant reliance on passwords to securely authenticate users of online services. The new standard for devices and browser plugins will allow any website or cloud application to interface with a broad variety of existing and future FIDO-enabled devices that the user has for online security. The FIDO Alliance has also established processes for accreditation of independent labs that will be able to analyze and identify products as “FIDO® Certified” in terms of interoperability, biometric matching performance, and security level.

Market Sectors: Government and Commercial
 
The market for biometrics may be segmented into government and commercial sectors. Principal government biometrics applications include border control, visa applicant screening, law enforcement, national defense, intelligence, secure credentialing, access control, and background checks. Principal commercial applications include: i) user authentication for login to mobile devices, computers, networks, and software programs; ii) user authentication for financial transactions and purchases (online and in-person); iii) physical access control to buildings; and iv) identity proofing of prospective employees and customers.
 
We believe that government and commercial entities will continue to adopt and expand the use of biometrics-enabled solutions to address the limitations and vulnerabilities of traditional identification and authentication processes. We believe the following factors, among others, will contribute to the growth of biometrics solutions: i) government-mandated implementation of identification for employees, citizens, and foreign nationals to enhance national security; ii) military implementations for the identification of terrorists and other hostile persons; iii) increasing threats to personal security encountered in areas such as transportation; iv) government and commercial efforts to detect and reduce fraud and cybercrime; v) adoption of biometrics on mobile devices; and vi) the emergence and adoption of international biometrics standards.
 
There is commonality between how biometric technologies are used across government and commercial sectors. The primary consumers of biometric identification systems are government agencies, while the primary users of biometric authentication technology are consumers owning mobile devices. We believe that these sector-based distinctions are important to an understanding of Aware’s business as the vast majority of our revenue is currently derived from government customers.
 
Government Sector

Local, state, and national governments throughout the world were early adopters of biometrics technology and continue to be the largest consumers of the technology. At the local and state level, biometrics technology is used in the following applications:

· | Law enforcement applications that enable officers in the field to correctly identify potential suspects more reliably and efficiently by submitting live (suspect is known) or latent (suspect is unknown) biometrics samples to state or federal biometric search services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Background checks for employment screening;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | Driver’s licenses and identification cards; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | Benefits issuance.
--+-------------------

 
At the national level, biometrics technology is used in the following applications:
 

· | Border control
--+---------------


National governments throughout the world have mandated increased spending on security measures, implemented new regulations and placed greater emphasis on technology to address growing security concerns. Immigration and border control agencies have taken steps to improve security in response to heightened concerns over public safety from the threat of terrorism. They use biometrics to help establish the identity of visitors upon application for a visa or upon arrival at border checkpoints. For example, the U.S. Office of Biometric Identity Management currently requires foreign visitors entering the United States to have their ten fingers scanned and a facial photograph taken to determine if they are present on a watch list. The European Union now mandates that e-passports include fingerprint data in addition to a digital photograph.
 

· | Defense
--+--------


Within military organizations, key applications of biometrics include: i) background checks of military personnel and contractors; ii) access control to physical and digital assets; and iii) identification of unknown and potentially hostile persons by a comparison of their biometric sample against a watch list.
 

· | Law enforcement and background checks
--+--------------------------------------


Law enforcement agencies perform background checks that use biometrics to help confirm the identity of individuals who might be present in a biometric database. Background checks might also be provided as a service to other agencies within the government.
 

· | Access control
--+---------------


Governments also use biometrics for physical access control by storing biometric data on a digital ID card or smart phone and performing a match to verify that the holder of the card is the same person who was issued the card. Biometrics are also used for securing access to digital assets, where a biometric match might be required in addition to or in place of a password to gain access to a computer system.

Due to the nature of government applications, particularly those involving security and defense, government biometrics systems must be capable of accurately and rapidly searching large databases of stored samples. The ability to accurately and rapidly match samples against databases of millions of samples is critical because incorrect or delayed results could have severe adverse consequences. These requirements are an important distinguishing characteristic of the government market as compared to the commercial market.
 
Commercial Sector

The principal application of biometrics in commercial markets is user authentication, with identity proofing also emerging as an application. The types of users that may need to be authenticated or identified in commercial applications include customers, employees, contractors, visitors, healthcare patients, or other parties wishing to establish their identity towards gaining access to information, systems, bank accounts, credit card accounts, events, devices, or buildings.
 
In commercial markets, biometrics-based solutions compete with more traditional security methods including keys, cards, tokens, passwords, personal identification numbers (“PINs”) and security personnel. The adoption of biometrics by leading vendors of smartphones and other popular consumer products has increased users’ confidence and comfort with biometrics as a convenient and secure means of authentication in place of or in addition to passwords. Biometrics solutions are also being considered in commercial markets as a means to enhance identity proofing, sometimes referred to “know-your-customer” (“KYC”) and “know-your-employee” (“KYE”) efforts. KYC and KYE processes are designed to corroborate the identity data claimed by prospective customers and employees with multiple independent sources.
 
The commercial market for biometrics technology remains nascent. The rate of adoption of biometrics in commercial markets depends upon a number of factors, including: i) the performance and reliability of biometric solutions; ii) costs involved in adopting and integrating biometric solutions; iii) public concerns regarding privacy, including potential privacy legislation; and iv) standardization efforts by various industry consortia and standards bodies.
 
Examples of commercial market applications include:
 

· | User authentication for login and access to mobile devices, mobile apps, desktop computers, networks, and web-based software programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | User authentication for financial transactions in the financial services industry.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | User authentication for in-person or online purchases in the retail industry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | User authentication for physical access to secured buildings and perimeters.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | User authentication of employees to access private patient information in the healthcare industry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identity verification of patients in hospital and surgical settings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identity verification of test takers in the educational testing industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identity proofing of prospective customers in the financial services industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identity proofing of candidates for pre-employment screening and background checks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identification of undesirable customers in the gaming industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Market Segments: Consumer-Facing and Employee-Facing
 
The biometrics market may be further segmented into: i) a consumer-facing segment; and ii) an employee-facing segment.
 
Consumer-Facing segment – The primary applications in the consumer-facing segment are biometric identity proofing and authentication for the purpose of onboarding and authentication of customers of commercial organizations, and also for citizens by governments. Adoption of biometrics is stronger where the convenience of a password-free user experience is valued but there is also risk of fraud. Industries that fall into this category include financial services, retail, and healthcare. Government agencies similarly employ citizen-facing biometric identity proofing and authentication solutions in situations where there is potential risk of fraud, such as benefits disbursement and voting. Healthcare organizations use biometrics in a safety context to prevent patient misidentification and care delivery errors.

Employee-Facing segment – The primary applications in the employee-facing segment are identity proofing and authentication of employees as a means for screening of new employees, and for user authentication towards securing access for employees and contractors to digital assets against a breach. Applications for employee-facing biometrics are found in both the government and commercial sectors.
 
Delivery Models: Tools and Services, Solutions, Software as a Service
 
As with other technology products and services, there are different models for product and service delivery in the biometrics arena, including tools and services, solutions, and Software as a Service.

1. | Tools and Services – Customers can choose to build their own biometric system using off-the-shelf subcomponents purchased a la carte and used to design, develop, and operate their own bespoke system. In doing so, a customer may or may not decide to also receive services to help with that process. Those services might come from a software provider or a third-party system integrator. These customers tend to have highly specific requirements and the scale to justify the cost of acquiring a custom-configured biometric system. Government agencies tend to be an example of this class of customer.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Solutions – Some organizations prefer a more complete and comprehensive solution that sources most or all system capability and services from a single supplier and requires less customization. Companies that offer identification/access solutions or biometric smart cards tend to be an example of this class of customer.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Software as a Service – Advances in cloud computing and browser technology have made Software as a Service, or “SaaS” an increasingly common delivery model of enterprise software. Benefits derived include lower up-front costs as well as lower maintenance and support risk. Biometric solutions can be provided as SaaS. Small and midsize commercial enterprises tend to be an example of this class of customer.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biometrics Industry Participants
 
There are a large number of vendors that serve government and commercial biometrics markets. In order to provide an understanding of the biometrics industry and our role in it, we have categorized industry participants into categories that have been defined by us. While we believe our categorization is a reasonable representation of the industry, we acknowledge that: i) knowledgeable industry participants may define categories differently or classify vendors differently; and ii) not all companies involved in the industry were included. Accordingly, the classification that follows represents our perspective on the industry.
 
We believe that biometrics industry participants may be classified into the following categories:
 

1) | Core technology suppliers
---+--------------------------


2) | System integrators
---+-------------------


3) | Fully integrated solution suppliers
---+------------------------------------


4) | Biometrics-as-a-service providers
---+----------------------------------


5) | Vendors of biometrically-enabled solutions
---+-------------------------------------------

 
Category descriptions and companies that offer products and services in each category are provided below. It should be noted that some companies appear in multiple categories.
 

1) | Core technology suppliers
---+--------------------------


Core biometrics technology includes hardware and software products that enable: i) traditional biometrics systems used by government and commercial customers; ii) new biometric service offerings; and iii) biometrically-enabled functionality embedded in other products and solutions. Core biometrics technology includes three types of products: i) sensor products, ii) biometric capture devices, and iii) software products.
 
Sensor products

Biometrics sensors are primarily silicon-based devices that capture biometrics samples, such as fingerprints. Sensors are typically embedded in other devices, such as smartphones or biometric capture devices.
 
Examples of companies that offer biometric sensor products include: 1) Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.; 2) Sonavation, Inc.; 3) Synaptics, Inc.; 4) Fingerprint Cards AB; 5) Integrated Biometrics, LLC; and 6) Next Biometrics AS.

2) | System integrators
---+-------------------


System integrators purchase hardware and software technology from core biometrics technology vendors and incorporate those components into customized biometrics systems that they deliver to end-user customers. Historically those end-user customers have been governments, but in recent years system integrators have begun to serve commercial enterprise customers as well. System integrators include large multinationals with a broad range of expertise and the capacity to execute very large projects, as well as smaller system integrators that have more focused expertise on a particular market sector, technology, or geography. Some system integrators have developed their own biometric technologies that they deliver as part of their solutions.
 
Examples of companies that offer systems integration services include: 1) Northrop Grumman Corporation; 2) Science Applications International Corporation; 3) Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services; 4) International Business Machines Corporation; 5) Fujitsu Limited; 6) Accenture plc; 7) Unisys Corporation; 8) Leidos, Inc.; and 9) ManTech International Corporation.
 

3) | Fully integrated solutions suppliers
---+-------------------------------------


Fully integrated solutions suppliers are similar to systems integrators in that they deliver customized biometrics systems to government and commercial enterprise end-user customers. They differ from system integrators in that they use core hardware and software technologies that they developed in-house or acquired from others. Vendors in this category may purchase some third party software, but we believe such purchases represent a minor component of the overall systems they deliver.
 
There are three large global suppliers of fully integrated solutions, including: 1) Idemia; 2) Gemalto; and 3) NEC. We believe these companies supply a large percentage of the biometric systems that are delivered to government customers around the world.
 
In addition to these three large suppliers, we would categorize Dermalog as a fully integrated solution provider, but one that operates on a smaller scale. Aware also has a product portfolio and services capability that enables us to deliver fully integrated solutions. We have acted in this capacity on a limited basis in the past and an element of our strategy is to grow this part of our business in the future.
 

4) | Biometrics-as-a-service providers
---+----------------------------------


Biometrics service providers have begun to offer a pay-per-transaction biometrics service offering. This service allows organizations to biometrically identify or verify employees, customers, or other individuals relevant to their business. A pay-per-transaction model may be potentially more financially attractive for some organizations as compared to the cost of purchasing, installing and maintaining internal biometrics systems.

Examples of companies offering biometrics services include: 1) Certibio Identidade Biometrica, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Certisign Certificadora Digital S.A. (“Certisign”); 2) Idemia; 3) RightPatient, Inc.; 4) Microsoft Corporation; 5) SkyBiometry (a spin-off from Neurotechnology); 6) BioID GmbH; and 7) VoiceIt Technologies, LLC.
 

5) | Vendors of biometrically-enabled solutions
---+-------------------------------------------


Vendors of biometrically-enabled solutions provide products that are not principally marketed as biometrics products, but include biometric functionality. Biometrics capability is a feature, but not the chief function of these products. Such vendors represent a potential opportunity for core biometrics technology providers as some of them do not own core biometrics technology.
 
Examples of companies that offer biometrically-enabled smartphone products include: 1) Apple, Inc.; 2) Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; and 3) Google, Inc.
 
Examples of companies that offer secure identification/access solutions that incorporate biometrically-enabled components include: 1) Gemalto; 2) HID; 3) Entrust Datacard Corporation; and 4) Idemia.
 
Examples of companies that offer physical access control solutions that may incorporate biometrics include: 1) Honeywell International, Inc.; 2) Tyco International Ltd.; 3) LenelS2 (formed by combination of Lenel and S2 Security both of which were acquired by United Technologies Corp.); and 4) Stanley Security Limited.

2a. Knomi™
 
In 2017, we introduced Knomi, a mobile biometric authentication framework offering face, voice and keystroke dynamics. The Knomi mobile biometric authentication framework is a collection of biometric SDKs running on mobile devices and a server that together enable strong, multi-factor, password-free authentication from a mobile device using biometrics. Knomi offers multiple biometric modality options, including facial recognition, keystroke dynamics, and voice authentication as means to authenticate. Banks or any other commercial enterprise can deploy Knomi to enhance their password-based authentication mechanisms, making login to their mobile applications more secure and convenient for their customers and employees. Knomi software components can be used in different combinations and configurations to enable either a server-centric architecture or a device-centric, FIDO® Certified implementation.
 
2b. AwareABIS™
 
AwareABIS is an Automated Biometric Identification System (“ABIS”) used for large-scale biometric identification and deduplication using fingerprint, face, and iris recognition. It is a highly scalable platform that performs one-to-many search or one-to-one match against large stores of biometrics and other identity data. It does so by deploying biometric data and matching algorithms across a cluster of multiple computing nodes. Extremely large biometric databases (tens of millions of records) cannot be stored or efficiently searched on a single computer. Distributing the data and biometric comparison tasks across multiple machines enables even extremely large databases to be searched in only seconds. AwareABIS enables not only massive biometric search tasks but complex filter, search, match, and link operations critical to data preparation and quality assurance functions such as identity resolution and data deduplication. AwareABIS is built upon several mature, high-performance, field-proven applications, platforms, and algorithms from Aware. Components are available a la carte depending on the application and system requirements.
 
2c. WebEnroll
 
WebEnroll is a browser-based biometric enrollment and data management solution available as an enhanced version of BioSP™ (Biometric Services Platform) that utilizes BioComponents for capture of biographic data, fingerprints and facial images in a browser. Each BioComponent performs advanced biometric image autocapture as well as capture device hardware abstraction. Once images are captured, they are submitted to BioSP, where configurable workflows and modular software applications are used for processing, routing, and storage of each transaction. Biometric verification or identification can be added with Nexa or one of several third-party matchers integrated with BioSP, or an external matching service.
 
2d. Indigo
 
Indigo™ is Aware’s family of turnkey biometric solutions, available as traditional software licenses or as cloud-based software-as-a-service. Indigo solutions are designed to deliver useful functionality and powerful biometric matching performance out-of-the-box, without requiring integration and configuration. They are built upon Aware’s time-tested, market-leading software components for biometric enrollment, analysis, and matching.

3) | Imaging products
---+-----------------

 
In addition to our biometrics software products, we also sell products used in applications involving medical and advanced imaging. Our principal imaging product is Aware JPEG 2000, which is based on the JPEG2000 standard. The JPEG2000 standard is an image compression standard and coding system that was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000. Our JPEG2000 product is used to compress, store, and display images. Those images are typically medical images.
 
Software maintenance
 
We also sell software maintenance contracts to many of our customers who purchase software licenses. These contracts typically have a one year term during which customers have the right to receive technical support and software updates, if and when they become available. Customers tend to renew maintenance contracts during the period of time that our software is being used in their biometrics systems.

Services
 
We offer a variety of software engineering services, including: i) project planning and management; ii) system design; iii) software design, development, customization, configuration, and testing; and iv) software integration and installation. Services are typically, but not always, sold in conjunction with software licenses.
 
Service engagement deliverables may include: i) custom-designed software products; ii) custom-configured versions of existing software products; iii) one or more subsystems comprised of software products that are integrated within a larger system; or iv) complete software solutions. In some cases, the software resulting from service engagements may form the basis for new or improved Aware software products.
 
Our customers for services include: i) government agencies; ii) large multinational systems integrators; iii) smaller systems integrators with a particular market, technology or geographic focus; and iv) commercial providers of products, solutions, and services. We provide services directly to end-users or indirectly to end-users through systems integrators. When we provide services to systems integrators, they are often engaged with the end-user as a prime contractor and are responsible for delivery of a complete solution, in which case we typically serve as a subcontractor assigned a subset of the total scope of work.
 
The scope of our services projects varies. A small project might involve configuration and testing of a single software product, taking a small team one month or less. A large project might involve delivery of a more complex solution comprised of multiple products and subsystems, requiring a larger team to conduct project management, system design, software customization and integration, and taking up to one year or more. Some projects are followed by subsequent projects that serve to change or extend the features and functionality of the initial system.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 10 employees in our sales and marketing organization. In addition to our employee sales staff, we also engage third party sales agents to sell our products and services in foreign countries.
 
We sell our products and services through three principal channels of distribution:
 

i) | Systems integrator channel – we sell to systems integrators that incorporate our software products into biometrics systems that are delivered primarily to government end users.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii) | OEM channel – we sell to hardware and software solution providers that incorporate our software products into their products.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii) | Direct channel – we also sell directly to government, and, to a lesser degree, to commercial customers.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All of our revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was derived from unaffiliated customers. In 2018, two customers represented 20% and 13% of total revenue. In 2017, one customer represented 17% of total revenue. In 2016, two customers represented 21% and 13% of total revenue. No other customer represented 10% or more of total revenue in any of those years.
 
Competition
 
The markets for our products and services are competitive and uncertain. We compete against: i) other companies that provide biometric software solutions; and ii) fully diversified companies that provide biometric software solutions and also act as systems integrators. We can give no assurance that: i) our products and services will succeed in the market; ii) that we will be able to compete effectively; or iii) that competitive pressures will not seriously harm our business.
 
Many of our competitors are larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technological, marketing and personnel resources than we do. At the other end of the competitive spectrum, we have seen increasing competition from smaller biometrics companies in foreign countries. These smaller foreign competitors have demonstrated a willingness to sell their biometrics software products at low prices.
 
We can give no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase products from us or that we will be able to compete effectively in obtaining new customers to maintain or grow our business.

Aware’s Strategy
 
Our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand and reputation to sell biometrics software products and services into government and commercial markets. We intend to continue to offer a broad portfolio of high quality products that are coupled with expert technical support and services. We expect to continue to employ a three-pronged distribution strategy using systems integrators, OEMs, and direct sales.
 
Our strategy for growing our biometrics business may include one or more of the following elements:
 

i) | Product strategy – Our product strategy is to offer more complete biometrics solutions. We believe this strategy will allow us to us to sell more software and services into biometrics projects. We recognized the need to make this transition several years ago and developed new products to enable this strategy.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our strategy to offer complete solutions involves:
 

· | Product line expansion - Our aim is to expand our product portfolio by adding new products and increasing the functionality of existing products using our internal engineering teams. This means we may add resources to our engineering staff. To the extent we are unable to develop critical new technologies internally, we may purchase or license such technologies from third parties. Alternatively, we may also acquire biometrics companies provided we believe the acquisition cost is reasonable relative to the estimated future revenue and profits the acquired company may produce.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Engineering services – We believe that services are an important element of our strategy to sell complete solutions. We intend to have adequate engineering resources on hand to ensure that we can staff projects with the technical expertise we need to win new projects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii) | Market strategy – Our market strategy is to continue to focus on our legacy government biometrics market and expand into new commercial biometrics markets. Historically our revenue has been primarily derived from the government biometrics market.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the evolution of commercial markets over the past few years may present mobile authentication and enterprise opportunities. To that end, we have modified some of our products to enable us to participate in these markets.
 

iii) | Sales strategy – While the United States remains a large market, we believe there are attractive growth opportunities in international markets. We intend to continue our focus on international markets and pursue opportunities in those markets through our sales staff and third party sales agents.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As we attempt to grow our biometrics business, we may make investments in growth initiatives, such as those described above, that may cause our profitability to decline in the near term.
 
Backlog
 
We had $4.7 million of backlog on December 31, 2018. We define backlog as revenue items in deferred revenue and undelivered orders in our backlog report. Total backlog of $4.7 million included: i) $3.2 million of software maintenance revenue of which approximately $3.1 million will be recognized during 2019; ii) $0.8 million of software license revenue that we anticipate will be recognized during 2019 and iii) $0.7 million of services revenue that we anticipate will be recognized during 2019. 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development activities are focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products. Our engineering organization is based in Bedford, Massachusetts. As of December 31, 2018, we had an engineering staff of 47 employees, representing 70% of our total employee staff.

Patents and Intellectual Property 
 
We rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights. We have an active program to protect our proprietary technology through the filing of patents. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 81 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 40 pending patent applications. Our patents and patent applications pertain primarily to biometrics and imaging compression.
 
Although we have patented certain aspects of our technology, we rely primarily on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures. Each of our employees is required to sign a non-disclosure and non-competition agreement. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, we cannot assure you that these measures will be successful. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
 
Third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. From time to time, we receive claims from third parties suggesting that we may be obligated to license such intellectual property rights. If we were found to have infringed any third party’s patents, we could be subject to substantial damages or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business.
 
Manufacturing & Systems Integration
 
We do not design or manufacture hardware products, however we have provided systems integration services for one U.S. government customer. Our systems integration activities include: i) procuring hardware and software components from third party suppliers; ii) installing Aware and third party software on the purchased hardware; and iii) testing products for quality assurance prior to shipment.
 
To the extent we receive any more orders for hardware revenue in the future, we rely on single source suppliers for certain critical hardware and software components. Our dependence on single source suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over availability, quality, and delivery schedules. Any delays in delivery or shortages of such components could cause delays in the shipment of our products, which could harm our business.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed 67 people, including 47 in engineering, 10 in sales and marketing, and 10 in finance and administration. Of these employees, 64 were based in Massachusetts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in large part on the service of our technical, sales, marketing and senior management personnel and upon our ability to retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key managers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future.
