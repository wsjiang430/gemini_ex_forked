BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Our business segments are generally organized by the type of customer served and reflect the way we manage the company. Additional information concerning our segments appears under the caption “Note 18: Business segment information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report.
Small Business Services
Small Business Services operates under various brands, including Deluxe®, Safeguard®, PsPrint®, Hostopia®, VerticalResponse®, Digital Pacific®, Inkhead®, LogoMix®, ColoCrossing®, and MyCorporation®, among others. This is our largest segment in terms of revenue and operating income and we are focused on profitably growing this segment. We strive to be a leading supplier to businesses, as well as partners and channels that support small businesses, by providing personalized products and services that help them operate and market their businesses. This segment sells products and services in North America, Australia and portions of South America and Europe.
Small Business Services' products are distributed through multiple channels. Our primary customer acquisition methods are direct response mail and internet advertising; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunications clients and other partners; affiliate relationships; networks of distributors and independent dealers; a direct sales force that focuses on selling to and through enterprise accounts; and an outbound telemarketing group. Customer service for initial order support, product reorders and routine service is provided by a network of call center representatives located in the United States, Canada and Australia.
Our Small Business Services strategies are as follows:

• | effectively acquire and retain customers by optimizing each of our sales channels;


• | expand sales of higher growth and recurring MOS offerings to offset the secular decline in check and forms usage;


• | increase our share of the amount small businesses spend on the types of products and services in our portfolio through increased brand awareness, channel coverage, and improved customer acquisition; and


• | Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure.

Key areas that support our Small Business Services strategies include:

1. | Web services:


* | Improve the digital marketing customer experience and cross-sell across all customers and channels, including through our integrated Deluxe Marketing Suite, while continuing to build partnerships and explore acquisition opportunities.


* | Accelerate our brand awareness transformation, building a clear linkage between marketing and revenue-generating capabilities.


* | Focus on scaling payroll services and continue to evaluate early stage businesses and other operational annuity growth solutions.


2. | Payments and marketing solutions:


* | Optimize ePayments, with a focus on building opportunities with financial institutions, health care and insurance payment processors, accounting services and software providers, and other document management and payment solution companies.


* | Focus on core check retention and acquisition and on developing incremental retail customer acquisition channels.


* | Profitably scale integrated marketing-on-demand solutions, with the largest opportunity in enterprise accounts.

In support of our strategies, we expect to continue identifying opportunities to expand sales to our existing customers and to acquire new customers, including the small business customer referrals we receive through our Deluxe Business Advantage® program. This program provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. Our relationships with financial institutions are important in helping us more deeply serve unique customer segments, such as contractors, retailers and professional services firms. In addition, we expect to continue to acquire customers through our affiliate partners, telecommunications clients, media partners and enterprise account clients. We invest in our e-commerce and technology platforms to increase opportunities to market and sell online, and we utilize various marketing channels, including internet, direct mail solicitations and television. Our distributor and dealer networks and our enterprise accounts channel increase our distribution reach through dedicated “feet on the street,” resellers and partner operations, and allow us to increase sales to existing customers and acquire new customers via multiple methods. 
We continuously evaluate ways to strengthen our portfolio of products and services through acquisitions and internal development. In recent years, we have acquired a number of businesses that have expanded our MOS offerings, including technology-based solutions such as web services, payroll services, web-to-print capabilities and internet marketing services, and we have developed ePayments solutions, including eChecks and eDeposits. Sales of these higher growth products and services are expected to represent an increasing portion of our revenue. Additional information concerning our acquisitions appears under the caption “Note 6: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. In addition, we track innovations within the marketplace coming from competitors, best-of-breed companies and evolving technology products and communities. When making decisions regarding the technologies and methodologies to employ within our product and service areas, we incorporate leading new techniques when they meet our fundamental need for scale, performance, flexibility and security. We also monitor feedback from our customer channels to ensure we are offering the products and features our customers want.
We continue our efforts within Small Business Services to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. Small Business Services outsources the production of many of its products, including certain business forms, promotional products and apparel. In conjunction with our cost reduction initiatives, we strive to further enhance our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements. In addition, the expertise we have developed in logistics, productivity and inventory management has allowed us to reduce the number of facilities we operate, while still meeting customer requirements. During 2018, we closed an administrative facility in St. Petersburg, Florida. During 2017, we closed a retail packaging sales location in Dallas, Texas and during 2016, we closed a call center located in Los Angeles, California, a warehouse located in Houston, Texas and a facility housing general office space in Burnsville, Minnesota. The operations of these facilities were integrated into existing Small Business Services operations.
Financial Services
Financial Services' products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force, which executes product and service supply contracts with our financial institution clients, including banks, credit unions and financial services companies. Building on our long-standing reputation in the financial services industry as a leading check provider, we have expanded our offerings to include a growing selection of software and cloud-based products and services designed to help financial institutions better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle. Our sales force is selling these life cycle management solutions through our existing financial institution customer channel to existing clients and to new clients. In addition, certain of our service offerings are sold to clients other than financial institutions.
Our Financial Services strategies are as follows:

• | expand sales of higher growth MOS offerings that differentiate us from our competition,


• | optimize core check revenue streams and acquire new clients, and


• | continue to optimize our cost and expense structure.

Key areas that support our Financial Services strategies include:

1. | Data-driven marketing solutions:


* | Leverage data-driven analytics and marketing capabilities to grow financial institution depository and lending products.


* | Assess potential acquisitions in this market space.


2. | Treasury management solutions:


* | Profitably scale our treasury management solutions.


* | Further integrate previous acquisitions to fully leverage our capabilities.


* | Assess potential acquisitions in this market space.

Despite the secular decline in check usage, checks continue to be an important source of revenue. Our check supply contracts usually range in duration from 3 to 6 years. As part of our check programs, we provide enhanced services, such as customized reporting, file management, expedited account conversion support, fraud protection services, new account support, trackable delivery and billing services. Consumers typically submit their check order to their financial institution, which then forwards the order to us. Consumers may also submit their check orders over the phone or internet. All orders are shipped directly to the consumer. We also continue to leverage our Deluxe Business Advantage program, which is designed to maximize financial institution business check programs. It offers many of the products and services of our Small Business Services segment to the small business customers of financial institutions through a number of service level options. The revenue from the products and services sold through this program is reflected in our Small Business Services segment.
In our ongoing efforts to expand our client relationships with relevant growth services, we offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle. All of these offerings build on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted partner of financial institutions, especially when it comes to outsourced solutions and securely managing sensitive customer data. Our service offerings include the following:

• | Deluxe Marketing Solutions – a variety of direct marketing solutions that help financial institutions acquire new customers, deepen existing customer relationships and retain customers. These offerings leverage data and analytics to help our clients execute marketing campaigns for deposit and lending products across multiple contact channels, including direct mail, email, online and other digital media.


• | Deluxe Treasury Management – comprehensive treasury management solutions, including accounts receivable processing and remote deposit capture, available at the customer site and as software-as-a-service and business process outsourced deployment models.


• | Deluxe Rewards – a loyalty and rewards platform that offers multiple touch points that enable our clients to have ongoing engagement with their customers.


• | Deluxe Strategic Sourcing – a comprehensive, outsourced service that enables financial institutions to improve efficiency, financial controls and pricing compared to self-managing multiple supplier relationships.


• | Banker's Dashboard® – online financial management tools that provide financial institutions with comprehensive daily insights into their financial picture.


• | Provent® – a comprehensive suite of identity protection services largely complementary to our check offerings.

We continue to advance our Financial Services' MOS offerings both via acquisitions and internal development. In recent years, we have acquired a number of businesses that have expanded our MOS offerings, including data-driven marketing solutions and treasury management solutions. Sales of these higher growth services are expected to represent an increasing portion of our revenue. Additional information concerning our acquisitions appears under the caption “Note 6: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. We expect that providing a growing selection of products and services will offset the impacts of the secular decline in check usage and the continued pricing pressure we are experiencing in our check programs. As such, we focus on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services, utilizing client feedback and market research to identify client needs and gaps. We have also invested in extending the Deluxe brand to increase brand awareness and loyalty in the financial services market beyond check-related solutions.
Financial Services continues to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. During 2018, we closed administrative facilities located in Livonia, Michigan; Nashville, Tennessee; and Henderson, Kentucky. During 2017, we closed administrative facilities located in Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, and during 2016, we closed a warehouse located in Nashville, Tennessee. The operations of these facilities were integrated into existing Financial Services operations.
Direct Checks
Direct Checks is the nation's leading direct-to-consumer check supplier, selling under various brand names, including Checks Unlimited®, Designer Checks®, Checks.com®, Check Gallery®, The Styles Check Company®, and Artistic Checks®, among others.
We use a variety of direct marketing techniques to acquire new customers, including newspaper inserts, in-package advertising, statement stuffers and co-op advertising. We also use search engine marketing and search engine optimization strategies to direct traffic to our websites, which include: checksunlimited.com, designerchecks.com, checks.com, checkgallery.com, styleschecks.com, and artisticchecks.com, among others.
Direct Checks competes primarily on price and design. We believe that pricing in the direct-to-consumer channel is generally lower than retail prices charged to consumers in the financial institution channel. We compete on design by seeking to 
offer the most attractive selection of images with high consumer appeal, many of which are licensed from well-known artists and organizations.
Our Direct Checks strategies are as follows:

• | maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features, accessories and products;


• | continue to optimize our cost and expense structure; and


• | optimize cash flow.

We market our products and services through targeted advertising, with internet advertising being the most cost effective. We continue to explore avenues to expand sales to existing customers through sales of accessories and other check-related products and services, such as the check protection service we offer with EZShield, Inc., which provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks. As in our other two business segments, Direct Checks continues to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. We continue to identify additional opportunities to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas, particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment.
MANUFACTURING AND FULFILLMENT/SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES
We continue to focus on improving the customer experience by providing excellent service and quality, reducing costs and increasing productivity. We accomplish this by embedding lean operating principles in our manufacturing processes, while emphasizing a culture of continuous improvement. We have a shared services approach, which allows our 3 business segments to leverage shared manufacturing facilities to optimize capacity utilization, enhance operational excellence and foster a culture of continuous improvement. We continue to reduce costs by utilizing our assets and printing technologies more efficiently and by enabling employees to better leverage their capabilities and talents.
Our expertise in logistics, productivity and inventory management has allowed us to reduce the number of production facilities we operate, while still meeting customer requirements. During 2018, we closed our Riverside, California and San Antonio, Texas fulfillment operations. During 2017, we closed our Westlake Village, California fulfillment operation, and during 2016, we moved production out of our Lancaster, California manufacturing facility. These operations were moved to other existing locations.
We continue to sponsor “sustainability” initiatives that encompass environmentally-friendly practices. We have aligned with suppliers that promote sustainable business practices and we seek opportunities to eliminate wasted material, reduce cycle times and use more environmentally-friendly materials. More than 90% of our check and forms paper is purchased from Forest Stewardship Council certified supplier mills and we use environmentally-friendly janitorial supplies. Our sustainability initiatives have also benefited our results of operations over the past several years as we focus on reducing our consumption of water, electricity and natural gas, and improving our transportation efficiency. We continue efforts to reduce solid waste sent to landfills, and we have been a member of the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Leadership Club since 2010.
CYBERSECURITY
We have a risk-based cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data as well as data belonging to our customers and business partners. We utilize a defensive in-depth strategy, with multiple layers of security controls to protect our and our customers' data and solutions. Organizationally, we have a cross-functional Enterprise Risk Council that reviews and advises on standards and policies. We also have an Enterprise Information Risk Management program and Cyber Incident Response teams to ensure compliance with our security policies and protocols. These teams are comprised of experts from across our company, as well as outside experts in some cases, to ensure that we are monitoring the effectiveness of our cybersecurity vulnerability management programs. Additionally, we periodically discuss identified enterprise risks with our board of directors, including cybersecurity risks. For more information on risks related to data security, see Item 1A, "Operational Risks – Security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially harm our reputation and business."
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Checks
Check printing continues to be a significant portion of our business. While we believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990s. In 2019, we anticipate check orders will decline at approximately the same rate as in 2018, and we expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods. Further information regarding the decline in check usage can be found in Item 1A, "Strategic Risks – The use 
of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with other sources of revenue." We cannot predict the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will replace checks over the long-term, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preferences or otherwise.
In addition to the shift to electronic payment methods, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts also impact the number of checks consumers use. We estimate that the 2018 growth rates for consumer spending and private sector employment most likely had a slightly positive impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts also has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the United States Census Bureau in December 2018, housing units completed in 2018 through November increased approximately 4% as compared to 2017. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.
Small Business Customers
According to data published by the United States Census Bureau, there were more than 32 million small businesses in the United States in 2016, defined as independent businesses having fewer than 500 employees. According to data published by Statistics Canada in December 2018, there are approximately 4 million small businesses in Canada, defined as employer businesses with fewer than 100 employees.
Economic conditions have a significant impact on our small business customers, and the trends were mostly positive during 2018. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) completes monthly surveys that indicate small business owners' views of economic conditions. After record readings in the third quarter of 2018, the index of small business optimism published by the NFIB in December 2018 fell to 104.4, down slightly from 104.9 in December 2017. However, the average index was 106.7 for 2018, up from the 104.8 average in 2017. At the same time, the net percent of small business owners expecting general business conditions to be better in 6 months decreased significantly to 16% in December 2018, as compared to 33% in September 2018 and 37% in December 2017. Although these surveys showed optimism from small business owners for most of 2018, the declines in December indicate some uncertainty. We cannot predict whether small business optimism will trend positively for a sustained period of time or whether such a trend would translate into increased revenue for us. Small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. If there were a downturn in general economic conditions, the operating results and/or growth opportunities for our Small Business Services segment could be negatively impacted. We cannot predict whether economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.
Sales of business checks and forms have been declining, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition to the decrease in the use of checks due to the availability of alternative payment methods, continual technological improvements have provided small businesses with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms.
Financial Institution Clients
Checks are most commonly ordered through financial institutions, including banks, credit unions and other financial services companies. As such, several developments related to financial institutions have affected the check printing portion of the payments industry.
Financial institutions seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated from their check programs, despite the secular decline in check usage. This continues to put significant pricing pressure on our check revenue. In addition, the number of potential financial institution clients in the United States is declining. According to statistics currently available online from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Credit Union National Association, the number of financial institutions has been declining for many years. When financial institutions consolidate through mergers and acquisitions, often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other financial institution in the combined entity. Financial institution mergers and acquisitions can also impact the duration of our contracts. Normally, the length of our check supply contracts with financial institutions ranges from 3 to 6 years. However, contracts may be renegotiated or bought out mid-term. Banks, especially larger ones, may request prepaid product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable at the beginning of a contract. These payments negatively impact check producers' cash flows at the beginning of these contracts. To the extent financial institution failures and consolidations impact large portions of our customer base, this could have a significant impact on our financial institution check programs.
Competition
Suppliers of small business services and products are highly fragmented and geographically dispersed, with many small local suppliers, large national retailers and internet-based providers. In these markets, the competitive factors influencing a customer's purchase decision are breadth and quality of product and service offerings, ease of use of web and other services, 
price, speed of delivery, convenience, the responsiveness and quality of customer support, and past experience with the supplier. Our primary competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration, wholesale printers, online printing companies, email and social media marketing services companies, small business products and services resellers, media directory providers, and suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Additionally, the competitive landscape for online small business suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence. We believe we are well-positioned in this competitive landscape through our broad customer base, the breadth of our small business product and service offerings, multiple distribution channels, established relationships with our financial institution and telecommunications clients and other partners, competitive pricing tiers, ease of use of our web and other services, our high quality and our dependable service.
In the check printing portion of the payments industry, we face considerable competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some significant retailers. We expect competition to remain intense as check usage continues to decline. Moreover, the check product must compete with alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, internet-based bill paying services and digital wallet applications. The principal factors on which we compete are product and service breadth, price, quality and check program management. We believe the key items which differentiate us from our competition include our fully automated flat check delivery package, our online performance dashboard and portal analytics tools for financial institution branches, our personalized customer call center experience, and our Deluxe Business Advantage program, which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. In addition, our Small Business Services ePayments offerings provide our small business customers with an alternative online payment and deposit solution.
Our check supplier competitors have reduced the prices of their products during the supplier selection process in an attempt to gain greater volume. The corresponding pricing pressure has negatively impacted our profit margins. Pricing pressure will continue to impact our results of operations through lower pricing levels or client losses. Additionally, product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable to financial institutions upon contract execution are a common practice within the industry. Both the number of financial institutions requesting these payments and the size of the payments has fluctuated in recent years. These up-front payments negatively impact check printers' cash flows at the beginning of the contracts, so we attempt to minimize them by structuring new contracts with alternative incentives throughout the duration of the contract.
Our Financial Services MOS offerings also face intense competition, including competition from financial institution core banking software providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology services providers offering services such as customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, receivables management and treasury support services, and rewards and loyalty solutions. We expect the intensity of competition to increase from established and emerging financial technology companies. The competitive factors affecting Financial Services MOS offerings include breadth and quality of services, ease of use, price, solution completeness, responsiveness and quality of customer support, as well as the ability to manage end-to-end financial institution processes.
Seasonality
We experience seasonal trends in sales of some of our products. For example, holiday card and retail packaging sales and revenues from rewards and loyalty solutions, as well as search and email marketing, are typically stronger in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. Sales of tax forms are stronger in the first and fourth quarters of the year, and check sales for our Direct Checks segment have historically been stronger in the first quarter of the year. In addition, we may experience some fluctuations in revenue driven by our customers' marketing campaign cycles. 
Materials, Supplies and Service Providers
The principal materials used in producing our main products are paper, plastics, ink, cartons and printing plate material, which we purchase from various sources. We also purchase stock business forms and promotional apparel produced by third parties. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of materials from current or alternative suppliers.
We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. We also rely upon third parties to provide a portion of the data used to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers. We believe we would be able to obtain an alternative source of supply if one or more of our service providers failed to perform.
Governmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant and regulators 
may adopt new laws or regulations at any time. We believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. For further information, please see Item 1A, "Legal and Compliance Risks – Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business." At this time, we are not aware of any changes in laws or regulations that will have a significant impact on our business during 2019. In June 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was signed into law and is effective on January 1, 2020. Among other requirements, businesses subject to the CCPA will need to proactively explain privacy notices to consumers when personal information is collected. Further amendments to the CCPA are likely and final regulations are yet to be published. We are currently assessing the impact of this law on our business activities.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights, either of which may adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 5,934 employees in the United States, 660 employees in Canada and 107 employees in Australia and Europe. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
