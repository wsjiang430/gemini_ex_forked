--------+---------

Overview
 
CoreCard Corporation, a Georgia corporation, and its predecessor companies have operated since 1973 and its securities have been publicly traded since 1980. In this report, sometimes we use the terms “Company”, “us”, “ours”, “we”, “Registrant” and similar words to refer to CoreCard Corporation and subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located in Norcross, Georgia and our website is www.corecard.com.
 
We are primarily engaged in the business of providing technology solutions and processing services to the financial technology and services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. Our operations are conducted through our affiliate companies located in Romania, India, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia, as well as the corporate office in Norcross, Georgia which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support. CoreCard’s foreign subsidiaries are CoreCard SRL in Romania, CoreCard Software Pvt Ltd in India, CoreCard Colombia SAS in Colombia and CoreCard Software DMCC in the United Arab Emirates, that perform software development and testing as well as processing operations support.
 
For further information about trends and risks likely to impact our business, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
 
CoreCard designs, develops and markets a comprehensive suite of software solutions to program managers, accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, fleet cards, buy now pay later programs, loyalty programs and accounts receivable and loan transactions. CoreCard utilizes the same core software solution in its processing operations as it sells to licensees, although licensees typically request a variety of customizations which may or may not deviate from the core software solution offering.
 
The CoreCard software solutions allow companies to offer any type of transacting account or card issuing program as well as installment and revolving loans, to set up and maintain account data, to record advances and payments, to assess fees, interest and other charges, to resolve disputes and chargebacks, to manage collections of accounts receivable, to generate reports and to settle transactions with financial institutions and network schemes.

The CoreCard proprietary software applications are based on CoreCard’s core financial transaction processing platform (CoreENGINE™) and address the unique requirements of customers and program managers that issue or process:
 

● | Credit Cards/Loans – revolving or non-revolving credit issued to consumer or business accounts (with or without a physical card) that typically involve interest, fees, settlement, collections, etc. Within this market, CoreCard offers software specifically tailored to handle private label cards, network branded (i.e., MasterCard, VISA, American Express or Discover) bank cards, fleet cards, loans of any type, or any other type of “system of record” accounts receivable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prepaid/Debit Cards – pre-loaded funds drawn down for purchase or cash withdrawal typically involving a variety of fees but no interest. Numerous examples exist including gift cards, loyalty/reward cards, health benefit cards, payroll and benefits disbursement, student aid disbursement, government assistance payments, corporate expense cards, transit cards and any other type of “system of record” stored value accounts.

The CoreCard software solutions allow customers to optimize their card account management systems, improve customer retention, lower operating costs and create greater market differentiation. The CoreCard solutions are feature-rich, have web interfaces including a standard library of APIs and contain financial transaction processing solutions that allow customers to automate, streamline and optimize business processes associated with the set-up, administration, management and settlement of credit, prepaid and loan accounts, to process transactions, and to generate reports and statements for these accounts. In addition, because the CoreCard products are designed to run on lower cost, scalable PC-based servers, rather than expensive legacy mainframe computers, customers may benefit from lower overall costs since the solution provides scalability by adding additional servers as card volume grows. The CoreCard product functionality includes embedded multi-lingual, multi-currency support, web-based interface, real-time processing, complex rules-based authorizations, account hierarchies, documented APIs for easy integration to the backend functionality and robust fee libraries. These features support customer-defined pricing and payment terms and allow CoreCard’s customers to create new and innovative card programs to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and improve customer retention.
 
We believe CoreCard is unique among software companies because it offers a full array of card and account management software solutions, available either for in-house license or outsourced processing by CoreCard’s processing business (“Processing Services”) at the customer’s option. CoreCard also provides customers with a unique option to license the same CoreCard software that is used in the CoreCard processing environment and transfer it in-house for customer-controlled processing at a later date.
 

● | License – CoreCard sells a software license to a customer who then runs the CoreCard software system, configured for the customer’s unique requirements, at a customer controlled location. It usually requires substantial additional resources from CoreCard to customize or operate the licensed software. CoreCard is de-emphasizing the license option.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Processing Services – CoreCard offers processing services that allow customers to outsource their card processing requirements to CoreCard. CoreCard manages all aspects of the processing functions using its proprietary software configured for each processing customer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to add resources to expand upon our infrastructure investment to support CoreCard’s Processing Services line of business. CoreCard processes prepaid cards and credit cards (private label and open loop/network) for a number of customers and anticipates steadily growing this business further in 2023 and future years. CoreCard has multiple secure processing data centers at third party locations, is certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards and has an SOC 1 and SOC 2 independent audit report that can be relied on by its prepaid and credit processing customers. It has obtained certification from American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa, Star and Pulse.
 
CoreCard added Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as a customer in 2018, referred to as “Customer A” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which represented 75% and 71% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect future professional services, maintenance, and license revenue from this customer in 2023 and future years, however the amount and timing will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization needed by the customer.
 
CoreCard has relationships with several financial institutions that are important for network certification, referrals for processing or program managers, and sponsoring prospective card programs.
 
CoreCard has Program Manager capabilities in addition to processing services, which has allowed us to gain additional experience and adding the potential for increased revenue, although we do not expect any significant revenue impact as a Program Manager in the near term.

CoreCard’s principal target markets include consumer revolving credit portfolios, accounts receivable businesses, prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers (large and small), small third-party processors, and small, mid-size and large financial institutions in the United States. CoreCard has customers in international markets as well. CoreCard competes with third-party card processors that allow customers to outsource their account transaction processing rather than acquire software to manage their transactions in-house. CoreCard competes with several larger and more established processors. Many of CoreCard’s competitors, especially certain processors, have significantly more financial, marketing and development resources than CoreCard and have large, established customer bases often tied to long-term contracts. CoreCard believes it can compete successfully in its selected markets by providing to its licensed software customers and processing customers a robust technology platform, greater system flexibility and more customer-driven marketing options. Additionally, the size and flexibility of CoreCard makes it possible to get to market more quickly with customized, flexible programs. Under our Processing Services option, customers can contract with CoreCard to provide processing services for their accounts using CoreCard software configured to the customer’s preferences, with an option to license the same software and bring it in-house when and if the customer decides to become its own processor in the future. We believe this transition path for customers is unique in the industry.
 
The CoreCard software platform and modules include CoreCREDIT™, CoreENGINE™, CoreISSUE™, CoreFRAUD™, CoreCOLLECT™, CoreAPP™, CoreMONEY™ and CoreACQUIRE™. Using a proprietary, base transaction processing platform called CoreENGINE, the CoreCard application modules have been further enhanced to meet the specific requirements of different market segments; for instance, CoreISSUE™ is available in different versions tailored to the requirements for issuing prepaid cards, fleet cards, bank cards or private label cards/accounts as well as accounts receivable management. In addition, CoreCard configures and/or customizes its robust base modules with additional or specific functionality to meet each customer’s requirements. The Company has developed and licensed such products to customers in the prepaid, fleet, private label, retail and credit markets. As is typical of most software companies, CoreCard expects to continually enhance and upgrade its existing software solutions and to develop additional modules to meet changing customer and market requirements. To date, CoreCard has focused its extensive development and limited sales activities on building a base of customers in each of its target markets, as well as putting in place the infrastructure and processes to be able to scale the business successfully, particularly for the Processing Services business.
 
Historically, most of the Company’s sales have resulted from prospects contacting CoreCard based on an online search or through industry referrals. CoreCard typically sells its products directly to customers, often in competitive situations, with relatively long sales and implementation cycles.
 
We have several revenue streams. We receive software license fees that vary depending upon the number of licensed users, number of accounts on the system, and the number of software modules licensed. We also derive service revenue from implementation, customization, and annual maintenance and support contracts for our licensed software. Processing customers pay an implementation and setup fee plus monthly service fees, primarily based on number of accounts, under a contract with a term of generally three or more years. Depending on factors such as contract terms, customer implementation and testing schedule, and extent of customization or configuration required and whether we are licensing or processing, the timing of revenue recognition on contracts may lead to considerable fluctuation in revenue and profitability. There are often delays in implementation cycles, especially for processing customers, due to third party approvals or processes that are outside of CoreCard’s control and thus it is difficult to predict with certainty when we will be able to begin recognizing revenue on new contracts.
 
CoreCard’s licensed software products are used by its customers to manage and process various credit, debit and prepaid card programs and there are a number of federal and state regulations governing the issuance of and the processing of financial transactions associated with such cards. CoreCard’s customers are required to comply with such regulations and, to the extent that customers depend on their licensed CoreCard software to manage and process their card accounts, the CoreCard software features and functionality must allow customers to comply with the various governmental regulations. CoreCard continually evaluates applicable regulations and regularly upgrades and enhances its software to help its customers meet their obligations to comply with current and anticipated governmental regulations. As part of CoreCard’s processing business, CoreCard provides compliance-related services, including data and network security, customer identification screening and regular reporting, which enable its customers to be in compliance with applicable governmental regulations including but not limited to the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering regulations with final responsibility for compliance resting with the customer. Depending on the extent of changes and new governmental regulations, CoreCard will regularly incur additional costs to modify its software and services to be compliant. CoreCard has no costs related to compliance with environmental laws.
 
Our business is not considered seasonal although the use of certain of our products may grow with the summer travel season for our Middle East customers and higher end-of-year spending patterns and possibly cause a small revenue increase during these periods.

Development Costs
 
We spent $11.7 million and $8.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on software development. We maintain a workforce of over 1,100 employees in our offshore operations in India, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia for software development and testing, as well as operations support for processing services. We are continuously improving our financial technology software in response to market requirements and trends and expect to continue to do so. Additionally, we are working on a new platform to maintain the latest technology.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
 
We have one U.S. patent covering aspects of CoreCard’s core software platform. It may be possible for competitors to duplicate certain aspects of our products and processes even though we regard such aspects as proprietary. We have registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and several foreign jurisdictions various trademarks and service marks for our products. We believe that an active trade secret, trade name, trademark, and copyright protection program is one element in developing and maintaining brand recognition and protecting our intellectual property. We presently market our products under trademarks and service marks such as CoreCard, CoreENGINE™, CoreISSUE™, CoreCOLLECT™, CoreMONEY™ and others.
Personnel
 
As of February 15, 2023, we had approximately 1,200 full-time equivalent employees (including our subsidiaries in the United States and foreign countries). Of these, the majority are involved in CoreCard’s software development, testing and operations, and 7 in corporate functions. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, we have not had any work stoppages or strikes, and we believe our employee relations are good.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
 
See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except for the risk associated with fluctuations in currency, we do not believe there are any specific risks attendant to our foreign operations that are significantly different than the general business risks discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.
