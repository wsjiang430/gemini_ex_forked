ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel, antibody-based therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. We are leveraging our proprietary antibody platforms and deep expertise in the field of antibodies to develop a broad portfolio of innovative medicines.
Our only approved drug DANYELZA® (naxitamab-gqgk) received accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in November 2020 for the treatment, in combination with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, or GM-CSF, of pediatric patients one year of age and older and adult patients with relapsed or refractory, or R/R, high-risk neuroblastoma, or NB, in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy. We are commercializing DANYELZA in the United States and began shipping in February 2021. In December 2022, we announced a distribution agreement with WEP Clinical Ltd., or WEP, in connection with an early access program for DANYELZA in Europe and 

5



in January 2023, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, agreed to our proposed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, for naxitamab.
DANYELZA has been evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study in front-line NB, a pilot study of chemoimmunotherapy for high-risk NB, and is currently being evaluated in a pivotal-stage multicenter trial (Study 201) which is designed to satisfy the accelerated approval confirmatory study and post-marketing requirements of the FDA, as well as a Phase 2 clinical study in second-line relapsed osteosarcoma patients.
​
We submitted a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA for radiolabeled 131I-omburtamab for central nervous system, or CNS, leptomeningeal metastases, or LM, from NB in August 2020, and received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA in October 2020. The reason for the FDA’s decision to issue the Refusal to File letter was that upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that certain parts of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control, or CMC Module and the Clinical Module of the BLA required further detail. Among other things, the FDA requested that detailed validation data be included in the CMC Module, that clinical study data and external control data be reanalyzed using a propensity score adjusted analysis for important baseline characteristics, such as prior receipt of irradiation, and that further supportive evidence in the form of direct anti-tumor effect be included in the Clinical Module. We held a number of Type B meetings with the agency, including a pre-BLA meeting in January 2022, before we resubmitted the BLA for omburtamab in March 2022. In October 2022 we met with the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, or ODAC, who reviewed 131I-omburtamab and voted 16 to 0 that we had not provided sufficient evidence to conclude that omburtamab improves overall survival. In November 2022, we received a complete response letter, or CRL, for the BLA. In the CRL, and in our Type A meeting held subsequent to receipt of the CRL, the FDA made recommendations for us to consider in terms trial design to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness and a favorable benefit-risk profile. We are currently considering the future for our omburtamab development program and we can provide no assurance that the development of omburtamab will continue or that omburtamab will ultimately receive FDA approval.
​
We are using our proprietary SADA BiDE (2-step Self-Assembly and DisAssembly Bispecific DOTA Engaging antibody system) Pre-targeted Radioimmunotherapy Platform, or the SADA Technology, a concept we also refer to as Liquid RadiationTM, to advance a series of antibody constructs, where bispecific antibody fragments bind to the tumor before a radioactive payload is injected in a two-step approach. We have designated GD2-SADA for potential use in GD2-positive solid tumors as our first SADA constructs and filed an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for GD2-SADA in December 2021. We obtained clearance for the IND in July 2022. We have secured clinical supplies for a medical radioisotope no-carrier-added, or n.c.a., lutetium-177 from ITM Isotope Technologies Munich SE, or ITM, who will provide its n.c.a. 177Lu for phase 1-3 clinical development of GD2-SADA. We announced our first hematological target CD38-SADA in December 2022, and expect to submit an IND for this construct in 2023. We believe the SADA technology could potentially improve the efficacy of radiolabeled therapeutics in tumors that have not historically demonstrated meaningful responses to radiolabeled agents. 
In January 2023 we announced a strategic restructuring plan designed to extend our cash resources and prioritize resources on the commercialization and potential label extension of DANYELZA and development of the SADA technology platform. In addition to deprioritizing the omburtamab program for all indications and product candidates, we have deprioritized other pipeline programs, including activities relating to GD2-GD3 Vaccine and CD33 bispecific antibody constructs by delaying trial initiation and overall timelines as part of the restructuring plan. The restructuring plan includes a reduction of our workforce by approximately 35% and is expected to be completed by the end of May 2023.
Our mission is to become the global leader in developing better and safer antibody-based pediatric oncology products addressing clear unmet medical needs and, as such, have a transformational impact on the lives of patients. We intend to advance and expand our product pipeline into certain adult cancer indications either independently or in collaboration with potential partners.
DANYELZA
 DANYELZA, our first FDA-approved product is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G, subtype 1k, or IgG1κ, monoclonal antibody or mAb that targets ganglioside GD2, which is highly expressed in various 

6



neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas. DANYELZA received regulatory approval by the FDA in November 2020 for the treatment, in combination with GM-CSF, of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and adult patients with R/R high-risk NB in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy. We are commercializing DANYELZA in the United States and began shipping it in February 2021. Sales of DANYELZA for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $49.3 million and $32.9 million. In July 2021, SciClone Pharmaceuticals International Ltd., or SciClone, submitted a BLA for DANYELZA for the treatment of patients with R/R high-NB to the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, of China and the BLA was approved in December 2022.
In addition, DANYELZA is currently being studied in several clinical trials, including a pivotal-stage multicenter trial (Study 201) which is also designed to satisfy the confirmatory study and post-marketing requirements by the FDA, and a Phase 2 clinical trial (Study 15-096) for relapsed osteosarcoma. DANYELZA was also studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial (Study 16-1643) in front-line NB and a pilot study (Study 17-251) of chemoimmunotherapy for high-risk NB.
We believe DANYELZA has multiple potential advantages over other GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies. In particular, its toxicity profile allows for doses two-and-a-half times greater than existing GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies. Unlike currently approved GD2-targeting therapies for NB, which require 10 to 20 hours of infusion and hospitalization for several days, DANYELZA is administered in approximately 30 to 60 minutes in an outpatient setting. We believe this significantly shorter administration time is an important advantage considering the overall pain associated with treatment.
Other than DANYELZA, there are no FDA-approved therapies for primary refractory or second-line pediatric NB patients. DANYELZA has also received orphan drug designation, or ODD, and rare pediatric disease designation, or RPDD, from the FDA for the treatment of NB. In addition, DANYELZA has received breakthrough therapy designation, or BTD, in combination with GM-CSF, for the treatment of high-risk NB refractory to initial therapy or with incomplete response to salvage therapy in patients greater than 12 months of age with persistent, refractory disease limited to bone marrow with or without evidence of concurrent bone involvement. In 2018, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation, or OMPD, for naxitamab for the treatment of NB, and in 2023 the EMA agreed to the Company’s proposed PIP for naxitamab.
While our current clinical efforts for DANYELZA are focused on rare pediatric cancers, we believe that we can potentially expand its application to the treatment of adults with cancers that express GD2. We estimate that there were more than 200,000 new adult patients diagnosed with GD2-positive cancers in the United States in 2022.
Omburtamab
Omburtamab is a murine monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3, an immune checkpoint molecule that is widely expressed in tumor cells of several cancer types, including pediatric CNS/LM from NB. 131I-omburtamab, which is omburtamab radiolabeled with Iodine-131, has been studied in several clinical trials including development Study 101 and Study 03-133 for the treatment of pediatric patients who have CNS/LM from NB. An analysis of 107 patients with pediatric CNS/LM from NB who were treated with 131I-omburtamab in Study 03-133 demonstrated a median overall survival, or OS, of 50.8 months, as compared to historical median OS of approximately six to nine months. 131I-omburtamab has received ODD and RPDD from the FDA for the treatment of NB, and BTD for the treatment of pediatric patients who have CNS/LM from NB. We submitted a BLA to the FDA for radiolabeled 131I-omburtamab for central nervous system, or CNS, leptomeningeal metastases, or LM, from NB in August 2020, and received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA in October 2020. The reason for the FDA’s decision to issue the Refusal to File letter was that upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that certain parts of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control, or CMC Module and the Clinical Module of the BLA required further detail. Among other things, the FDA requested that detailed validation data be included in the CMC Module, that clinical study data and external control data be reanalyzed using a propensity score adjusted analysis for important baseline characteristics, such as prior receipt of irradiation, and that further supportive evidence in the form of direct anti-tumor effect be included in the Clinical Module. We held a number of Type B meetings with the agency, including a pre-BLA meeting in January 2022, before we resubmitted the BLA for omburtamab in March 2022. In October 2022 we met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, 

7



and the ODAC, who reviewed 131I-omburtamab and voted 16 to 0 that we had not provided sufficient evidence to conclude that omburtamab improves overall survival. In November 2022, we received a CRL for the BLA. In the CRL, and in our Type A meeting held subsequent to receipt of the CRL, the FDA made recommendations for us to consider in terms of trial design to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness and a favorable benefit-risk profile. We are currently considering the future for our omburtamab development program and we can provide no assurance that the development of omburtamab will continue or that omburtamab will ultimately receive FDA approval.
As part of the restructuring plan, we also deprioritized 124I-omburtamab , which is omburtamab radiolabeled with Iodine-124, that was being studied for the treatment of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, or DIPG, and 131I-omburtamab that was being studied for the treatment of Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors, or DSRCT. 
Our Phase 1 multicenter study for 177Lu-omburtamab-DTPA, for the treatment of medulloblastoma, and our Phase 1 multicenter study with 177Lu-omburtamab-DTPA targeting B7-H3 positive CNS/LM tumors in adults were also deprioritized in 2022.
The SADA Technology
On April 15, 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the SADA License Agreement, with MSK and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain patent and intellectual property rights developed by MSK and MIT to develop, make, and commercialize licensed products and to perform services for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in the field of cancer diagnostics and cancer treatments the SADA Technology. The patents and patent applications covered by the SADA License Agreement are directed, in part, to the SADA Technology, as well as a number of SADA constructs developed by MSK.
We are using the SADA Technology to advance a series of antibody constructs based on the SADA technology, where bispecific antibody fragments bind to the tumor before a radioactive payload is injected in a two-step approach. We have designated GD2-SADA for potential use in GD2-positive solid tumors as our first SADA construct and filed an IND for GD2-SADA in December 2021. We obtained clearance for the IND in July 2022. The first clinical sites were activated in November 2022, and MSK opened in March 2023. We believe the SADA technology could potentially improve the efficacy of radiolabeled therapeutics in tumors that have not historically demonstrated meaningful responses to radiolabeled agents.

MSK License Agreements
We have exclusive rights to MSK’s rights in all of our current product candidates under our 2015 license agreement, or the MSK License, with MSK. The MSK License also provides us with non-exclusive access to technology that involves the creation of a novel human protein tag that can potentially dimerize, or link together, bispecific T-cell engagers, or BiTEs. We refer to this technology as the MULTI-TAG technology. We believe that our strong relationship with MSK, one of the world’s leading cancer treatment centers, and our access to certain of MSK’s technologies and substantial research capabilities affords us several competitive advantages. In addition, under a separate 2020 SADA License Agreement with MSK and MIT we have exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain patent and intellectual property rights developed by MSK and MIT to develop, make, and commercialize licensed products and to perform services for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in the field of cancer diagnostics and cancer treatments using the SADA Technology.
Material Funding Activities
Since our inception in April 2015, we have raised approximately $488.8 million through private placements of our securities, our initial public offering in September 2018 and our public offerings in November 2019 and February 

9



2021. In our secondary public offering in February 2021, we issued and sold 2,804,878 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $41.00 per share which included the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We received aggregate gross proceeds from our secondary public offering in February 2021 of $115.0 million, when the transaction closed in February 2021. On December 28, 2020, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our DANYELZA PRV to United Therapeutics Corporation for $105.0 million. The PRV was granted in conjunction with the approval by the FDA of DANYELZA, for the treatment of refractory/relapsed high-risk NB. Under the terms of the MSK License Agreement, we retained 60% of the net proceeds received from the sale, and the remaining 40% was paid to MSK. As a result, we received net proceeds from this sale of $62.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million.

Our Business Strategy
Our mission is to become the global leader in developing better and safer antibody-based pediatric oncology products addressing clear unmet medical needs and, as such, have a transformational impact on the lives of patients. We intend to advance and expand our product pipeline into certain adult cancer indications either independently or in collaboration with potential partners.
Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

● | Independently commercialize DANYELZA in indications and territories where we believe we can maximize the value. On November 25, 2020, DANYELZA received approval by the FDA following an expedited regulatory pathway and priority review under the BTD granted in 2018. We initiated commercialization of DANYELZA in the United States following the FDA approval. We plan to independently commercialize DANYELZA focusing on already-identified key treatment centers, as well as
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




educating doctors, patients and payors about DANYELZA and its current and future indication to drive acceptance and uptake. We believe that we will need to engage a small number of physician specialists for training regarding the appropriate administration and use of DANYELZA. The sales call points for DANYELZA in the United States are highly concentrated and generally addressable by a small commercial organization, which we believe will allow us to cost-effectively maintain our own commercial capability. Finally, we have already and we intend to form in the future commercial and development collaborations for indications and in territories that are better served by the resources of local specialists or larger biopharmaceutical companies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand the indications and target patient populations for our existing product candidates. Our goal is to maximize the potential of our existing product candidates in areas where there is a significant unmet medical need by exploring additional indications, as well as expanding the target population within existing indications. For example, we are developing DANYELZA for the treatment of front-line and third-line NB and relapsed osteosarcoma and we intend to discuss our BLA strategy in these indications with the FDA. We believe that we may qualify for a supplemental BLA, or sBLA, in each of these indications assuming positive pivotal data.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance our novel SADA constructs that we believe may offer potential substantial benefits over existing therapies. We are also advancing a series of promising SADA constructs that we believe have the potential to allow for easy adaptation to different tumor targets and a variety of payloads. In 2022 we opened the IND for our GD2-SADA construct for the treatment of GD2-positive solid tumors, and in 2023 we expect to submit an IND for CD38-SADA for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage our relationships with leading academic and clinical institutions to develop additional product candidates. We intend to continue to partner with leading centers, such as MSK, for cancer treatments worldwide, to identify and develop additional product candidates. We believe that our relationship with MSK, our access to several of their technologies and MSK’s significant expertise in pediatric cancer care provides us with significant competitive advantages. For example, our Investigator-Sponsored Master Clinical Trial Agreement, or the MCTA, with MSK provides us with ready access to patients for clinical trial enrollment, which is a significant advantage in rare disease drug development where patients are often hard to locate and recruit. Our Sponsored Research Agreement, or the SRA, with MSK, pursuant to which we agreed to provide research funding to MSK, grants us a first option to negotiate an exclusive license to MSK’s rights in any new joint inventions discovered under the SRA. We plan to leverage our strong relationship with institutions such as MSK and their expertise and research capabilities to augment our own capabilities in order to identify new product candidates for the treatment of cancers where there is a significant unmet medical need and no effective therapy currently available.

Current Approaches to the Treatment of Cancer
Cancer Overview
Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body. Cancers can subsequently spread throughout the body by processes known as invasion and metastases. Cancer cells that arise in the lymphatic system and bone marrow, or BM, are referred to as hematological malignancies. Cancer cells that arise in other tissues or organs are referred to as solid tumors.
Cancer is a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The National Cancer Institute, or NCI, estimated that approximately 40% of all men and women in the United States will be diagnosed with some form of cancer during their lifetime (based on 2017-2019 data). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, cancer is currently the second leading cause of death in the United States and is expected to surpass heart disease as the leading cause of death in the next several years. Although progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the American Cancer Society, or ACS, estimates that an estimated 1.8 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States and over 600,000 people will have died from cancer in 2023 (Cancer statistics, 2023 - 

11



Siegel - 2023 - CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians - Wiley Online Library). Thus, there remains a significant need for novel and improved treatment options for cancer patients.
Cancer treatment has traditionally included chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery or a combination of these approaches. While small molecule chemotherapy agents and cytotoxic agents have demonstrated efficacy in treating certain types of cancers, they can also cause toxicities that may lead to life-threatening consequences, lower quality of life or untimely termination of treatment. Furthermore, these treatments are only partially effective in solid tumors, in part because the maximal achievable doses are limited by systemic toxicity, which consequently hinders the prospects of long-term remission in patients. Over a course of more than 20 years, cancer research and treatment has shifted to more targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, and immuno-oncology, a new field of cancer therapy focused on enhancing antitumor immune responses.
Advances in understanding the immune system’s role in treating cancer have established immunotherapy, or the practice of harnessing immune system functions to combat malignant cell growth, as an important treatment approach. Cancer immunotherapy began with treatments that nonspecifically activated the immune system and had limited efficacy and/or significant toxicity. In contrast, new immunotherapy treatments can activate specific, key immune cells, leading to improved targeting of cancer cells, efficacy, and safety.
Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as front-line, second-line, or third-line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third-line use. When cancer is detected early enough, front-line therapy is sometimes adequate to effectively treat the cancer or prolong life. Whenever front-line therapy, usually chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second-line therapy may be administered. Second-line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, surgery, tumor-targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, or a combination of these. Third-line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery, and new technologies.
Immune System and Introduction to Antibodies
The immune system is often described as having two main branches—innate (non-specific) and adaptive (acquired) immunity. It defends against invading pathogens such as viruses, parasites, and bacteria, and provides surveillance against cancers. The innate immune system is the initial response to an infection, and the response is the same every time regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent. The adaptive immune system includes B-cells, which secrete antibodies and T-cells, which can be either helper T-cells, suppressor T-cells or cytotoxic T-cells.
An antibody, also known as an IgG, is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells in response to foreign substances, such as viruses or cancer cells. Antibodies circulating in the bloodstream function by binding to the target or antigen they are generated to fight. The binding process involves a lock-and-key mechanism in which the paratope region of the antibody, analogous to a lock, binds to one particular epitope of a specific antigen, analogous to a key. This allows the antibody to bind to a specific antigen with precision, thereby attacking only its intended target.
Different types of antibodies include: (i) Monoclonal Antibodies—laboratory-made antibodies typically derived from immune cells of mammals that have been immunized with a desired antigen and are all clones of a unique parent; (ii) Humanized/Chimeric Antibodies—antibodies with both mouse and human antibody proteins that are humanized (i.e., engineered to replace mouse components with more human components) to reduce the immune system response against antibodies identified as foreign (i.e., from a different species) in nature; (iii) Naked Monoclonal Antibodies—antibodies without any drug or radioactive material attached and which are the most common type of antibodies in treating cancer; (iv) Antibody Drug Conjugates, or ADCs—monoclonal antibodies that are joined to a chemotherapy drug, a radioactive particle or cancer cell killing agent, in which the monoclonal antibody is used as a homing device to deliver these substances directly to the cancer cell; and (v) Bispecific antibodies comprised of two different monoclonal antibody constructs, which allows the antibody to bind to two specific therapeutic targets at the same time, typically one target on the tumor cell and one target on an immune system cell.
Antibodies may function through multiple mechanisms simultaneously, including binding to cancer cells and flagging for B-cells and T-cells to more easily detect the target, or delivering radiation treatment by acting as a vehicle to 

12



transfer small radioactive particles directly to the cancer cells and to minimize the effect of radiation on normal cells. Other mechanisms include triggering cell-membrane destruction, preventing cell growth or blood vessel growth, blocking immune system inhibitors, directly attacking cancer cells and delivering chemotherapy or binding cancer cells and immune cells simultaneously.
Studies have shown that, as a drug class, antibodies have transformed oncology treatment and include some of the best-selling therapies on the biopharmaceutical market. 
Our Product and Product Candidates
We have one FDA-approved product and a broad and advanced product pipeline including product candidates primarily targeting clinically validated tumors that express GD2 and CD38, respectively.
On November 25, 2020, DANYELZA, was approved by the FDA, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage Colony-Stimulating factor, or GM-CSF, for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and adult patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy. We began to commercialize DANYELZA in the United States upon receipt of FDA approval in November 2020. DANYELZA is also in mid-stage clinical development for additional cancers, and we have initiated clinical development in other indications. 
Our product candidate 131I-omburtamab, or omburtamab, is in development for pediatric CNS/LM from NB—a rare and life-threatening pediatric cancer for which no FDA-approved products currently exist. We submitted a BLA to the FDA for radiolabeled 131I-omburtamab for central nervous system, or CNS, leptomeningeal metastases, or LM, from NB in August 2020, and received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA in October 2020. The reason for the FDA’s decision to issue the Refusal to File letter was that upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that certain parts of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control, or CMC Module and the Clinical Module of the BLA required further detail. Among other things, the FDA requested that detailed validation data be included in the CMC Module, that clinical study data and external control data be reanalyzed using a propensity score adjusted analysis for important baseline characteristics, such as prior receipt of irradiation, and that further supportive evidence in the form of direct anti-tumor effect be included in the Clinical Module. We held a number of Type B meetings with the agency, including a pre-BLA meeting in January 2022, before we resubmitted the BLA for omburtamab in March 2022. In October 2022 we met with the FDA’s ODAC who reviewed 131I-omburtamab and voted 16 to 0 that we had not provided sufficient evidence to conclude that omburtamab improves overall survival. In November 2022, we received a complete response letter, or CRL, for the BLA. In the CRL, and in our Type A meeting held subsequent to receipt of the CRL, the FDA made recommendations for us to consider in terms of trial design to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness and a favorable benefit-risk profile. We are currently considering the future for our omburtamab development program and we can provide no assurance that the development of omburtamab will continue or that omburtamab will ultimately receive FDA approval.
We are using our proprietary SADA BiDE (2-step Self-Assembly and DisAssembly Bispecific DOTA Engaging antibody system) Pre-targeted Radioimmunotherapy Platform, or the SADA Technology, a concept we also refer to as Liquid RadiationTM, to advance a series of antibody constructs, where bispecific antibody fragments bind to the tumor before a radioactive payload is injected in a two-step approach. We have designated GD2-SADA for potential use in GD2-positive solid tumors as our first SADA constructs and filed an IND for GD2-SADA in December 2021. We obtained clearance for the IND in July. We announced our first hematological target CD38-SADA in December 2022, and expect to submit an IND for this construct in 2023. We believe the SADA technology could potentially improve the efficacy of radiolabeled therapeutics in tumors that have not historically demonstrated meaningful responses to radiolabeled agents. 
In January 2023 we announced a strategic restructuring plan designed to extend our cash resources and prioritize the commercialization and potential label extension of DANYELZA and development of the SADA technology platform. In addition to deprioritizing the omburtamab program for all indications and product candidates, we deprioritized other pipeline programs, including activities relating to GD2-GD3 Vaccine and CD33 bispecific antibody constructs, by delaying trial initiation and overall timelines as part of the restructuring plan.

nivatrotamab and 177Lu-omburtamab were deprioritized during the first half of 2022. We have allocated de minimis resources to the deprioritized programs. In most cases, the INDs have been inactivated, which reduces our development costs while preserving our option to potentially revitalize programs at a later point.
We have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to all of our current product candidates and we have granted commercialization partners certain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DANYELZA and omburtamab in select territories, including Greater China, Israel, Latin America, Russia and certain Eastern European countries.
DANYELZA Overview
DANYELZA is a humanized monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA in combination with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating factor, or GM-CSF, for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and adult patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in the bone or bone marrow who have demonstrated a partial response, minor response, or stable disease to prior therapy, and being evaluated for the treatment of other GD2-positive tumors, including osteosarcoma. DANYELZA targets GD2, which, based on our research, is expressed on almost all NB cancer cells regardless of disease stage and in almost all osteosarcomas. DANYELZA was granted BTD for treatment of patients with pediatric R/R high-risk NB in 2018.
In November 2018, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation, or OMPD, for naxitamab for the treatment of NB. In January 2023, the EMA agreed to our proposed PIP for naxitamab. DANYELZA also received ODD and RPDD from the FDA for the treatment of NB in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The RPDD qualified us for receipt of a PRV upon approval of DANYELZA for treatment of NB, and we did receive such PRV in November 2020. As of December 2022, DANYELZA has been administered to more than 900 patients in clinical trials, including patients treated under our expanded access and compassionate use programs. Sales of DANYELZA for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $49.3 million.
In clinical studies, DANYELZA has been shown to cause serious infusion reactions including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, bronchospasm, stridor, and hypotension. The most common adverse events were mainly mild and moderate and included infusion-related reaction, pain, tachycardia, vomiting, cough, nausea, diarrhea, decreased appetite, hypertension, fatigue, erythema multiforme, peripheral neuropathy, urticaria, pyrexia, headache, edema, anxiety, localized edema and irritability. DANYELZA has been approved with a boxed warning for serious infusion reactions and neurotoxicity.
In pediatric R/R high-risk NB, we believe that DANYELZA has multiple potential advantages over other GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies. In particular, the modest toxicity it exhibits allows for doses 2.5 times greater than the other GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies. DANYELZA also has a significantly shorter infusion time (approximately 30 to 60 minutes compared to 10 to 20 hours for other GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies being used in front-line therapy), which we believe is important given the pain associated with the therapy and the ability to be administered in an outpatient setting.
In addition, DANYELZA has been evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study (Study 16-1643) in front-line NB, a pilot study (Study 17-251) of chemoimmunotherapy for high-risk NB and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study (Study 15-096) in second-line relapsed osteosarcoma patients. Moreover, we are planning an international multicenter randomized pivotal clinical study with DANYELZA compared to Standard of Care in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma with Pulmonary Only Recurrence (Study 205).
GD2 Overview
We believe that monoclonal antibodies such as DANYELZA that target ganglioside GD2 are one of the most promising cancer immunotherapy approaches. Gangliosides, including GD2, GM2, GD3, NGcGM3 and OAcGD2, have been shown to be expressed at very high levels in tumor cells of several types of cancers.
As a potential target molecule for anti-tumor therapy, GD2 has certain advantages when compared to other tumor associated gangliosides because it is highly expressed in tumor cells of several types of cancers and is not 

14



expressed at all, or expressed at very low levels, in normal cells. A National Cancer Institute pilot program for the prioritization of the most important cancer antigens ranks GD2 as number 12 out of 75 potential targets for cancer therapy based on therapeutic function, immunogenicity, role of the antigen in oncogenicity, specificity, expression level and percent of antigen-positive cells, stem cell expression, number of patients with antigen-positive cancers, number of antigenic epitopes, and cellular location of antigen expression. GD2 ranks as number six when compared to antigens that are directly targetable on the cell surface. Antibodies directed against GD2 have been shown to effectively induce cell death through a combination of both apoptosis and tumor cell necrosis in GD2-positive tumors.
GD2 Expression in Various Cancer Types
Studies have shown that GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectoderm-derived tumors and sarcomas, including NB, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma in children and adolescents, as well as liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and other soft-tissue sarcomas in adults. These cancers have a high mortality rate ranging from 20-80% depending on the tumor type. 
We believe there is a large market opportunity for the treatment of solid tumors that express GD2. Based on our own research and our review of published research, we believe GD2 expression occurs in approximately 60-100% of tumor samples from various cancer types, and in substantially all NB and osteosarcoma tumor samples. We estimate that there were more than 200,000 new patients diagnosed with GD2-positive cancer in the United States in 2017. While our clinical development efforts for DANYELZA are currently focused on rare pediatric cancers, we believe we have the potential to expand DANYELZA’s application beyond pediatric cancers to the treatment of adults with cancers that express GD2.
DANYELZA—mechanism of action
Our pre-clinical studies have shown that DANYELZA binds to GD2 molecules on tumor cells with high affinity and a slow off-rate, which indicates DANYELZA’s strong binding ability. In mice that have been transplanted with human NB tissue, DANYELZA demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth (i.e., the effect of DANYELZA varied with dosage) and generally increased survival. In vitro studies show that when DANYELZA binds to tumor cells, it induces tumor cell death through antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. DANYELZA may also inhibit tumor cell migration through its inhibitory effect on GD2 molecules, which are involved in tumor cell adhesion and migration. In vitro studies also show that Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, or GM-CSF, enhances the activity of DANYELZA in a dose-dependent manner and is therefore generally combined with DANYELZA in our clinical trials.
DANYELZA for the treatment of pediatric relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma
On November 25, 2020 DANYELZA® received regulatory approval by the FDA in the United States for treatment in combination with GM-CSF of high-risk R/R NB. This approval was based primarily on interim data from the Study 201 and Study 12-230. In order to meet certain post-marketing commitments issued by the FDA, Study 201 with DANYELZA is currently still ongoing for pediatric R/R high-risk NB. DANYELZA was granted BTD in this indication in 2018. In November 2018, the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation, or OMPD, for naxitamab for the treatment of NB. DANYELZA has also received ODD and RPDD from the FDA for the treatment of NB in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The RPDD qualified us for receipt of a PRV upon approval of DANYELZA for treatment of NB by the FDA, which we received in November 2020. The FDA has issued a post-marketing commitment to provide data on PFS, supporting the efficacy of the product. As of January 1, 2023 we have enrolled 87 patients and we anticipate completing the study no later than March 31, 2027. We believe DANYELZA has multiple potential advantages over other GD2-targeting antibodies such as higher doses and administration on an outpatient basis. 
In our studies to date, DANYELZA has demonstrated a manageable safety profile, which allows for 2.5 times greater dosing as compared to other GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies. This results in fewer doses per cycle and a significantly shorter infusion time (approximately 30 to 60 minutes versus 10 to 20 hours for dinutuximab). Notably, since severe pain is one of the most common side effects of treatment with GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies, we 

15



believe that the ability to reduce infusion time to approximately 30 to 60 minutes is very important for patients and may result in a significant reduction in demand for pain medication such as morphine. These factors allow DANYELZA to be administered in an outpatient setting whereas other GD2-targeting antibody-based therapies require hospitalization which usually lasts for four days or more.
Overview of Neuroblastoma
NB is a rare and almost exclusively a pediatric cancer that develops in the sympathetic nervous system, a network of nerves that carries messages from the brain throughout the body. It is the third most common childhood cancer, after leukemia and brain tumors, and is the most common solid extracranial tumor in children. NB is a life-threatening disease associated with poor long-term survival. It accounts for approximately six percent of all childhood cancers and approximately 15% of pediatric cancer deaths. Nearly 90% of patients with NB are diagnosed by age five and NB is very rare in people over the age of 10 years. The average age of children when they are diagnosed with NB is one to two years.
The stage of NB, which describes how far the cancer has spread, is based on results of physical exams, imaging tests, and biopsies. The International Neuroblastoma Staging System stages the disease from Stage 1 to Stage 4. Other factors that also affect prognosis of NB include age and amplification of MYCN oncogene.
NB patients can also be placed into different risk groups from low, intermediate to high based on the stage and other prognostic factors. High-risk NB is defined as MYCN amplified Stage 2, 3, 4S and 4 in patients of any age and MYCN non amplified Stage 4 in patients over 18 months of age.
There are approximately 700 children diagnosed with high-risk NB in the United States each year. We believe the European market is at least one and a half times the size of the U.S. market and that there are approximately 1,050 patients diagnosed with high-risk NB in Europe each year. We believe the current addressable market for DANYELZA consists of approximately 960 new front-line high-risk NB patients each year and 675 primary or second-line eligible R/R NB pediatric patients each year, representing approximately 40% of all pediatric patients diagnosed with NB in the United States and Europe, combined. Moreover, based on the protocol we have developed with MSK, between treatment and maintenance therapy, we believe that typically patients will receive five to ten treatment cycles of DANYELZA, each cycle consisting of three doses.
DANYELZA for Pediatric Relapsed or Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma—Current Treatment Landscape and Associated Limitations
Currently, front-line treatment for pediatric NB patients usually occurs in three stages: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. During the induction phase, patients receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy and possibly surgery to eliminate as much tumor tissue and as many tumor cells as possible. Commonly used agents for induction treatment include cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine. Following surgery and/or radiotherapy, most patients enter into consolidation therapy with the goal of eliminating any residual tumor usually with single dose myeloablative agents (e.g. carboplatin-etoposide-melphalan) with stem cell support or an autologous stem cell transplant or repeated transplants with thiotepa-cyclophosphamide followed by cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and ranimustine. Many treatment centers also use immunotherapy as part of the consolidation stage of treatment. Relapse is a frequent occurrence after consolidation.
Other than DANYELZA, there are no approved therapies in the United States for R/R NB patients. Other treatments typically include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other experimental therapies.
In 2015, the FDA and the EMA, approved Unituxin (dinutuximab), a monoclonal GD2-targeting antibody developed by United Therapeutics Corporation, or United Therapeutics, and administered in combination with GM-CSF, interleukin-2, or IL-2, and isotretinoin, also known as 13-cis-retinoic acid, for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk NB who achieve at least a partial response, or PR, to prior front-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. The marketing authorization for Unituxin was voluntarily withdrawn by United Therapeutics in the European Union in 2017. In 2017 the EMA approved Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (also known as dinutuximab beta, ch14.18/CHO, Isqette and 

16



currently being commercialized under the name Qarziba® in Europe), a monoclonal GD2-targeting antibody, for the treatment of high-risk NB in patients aged 12 months and older, who have had some improvement with previous treatments or patients whose NB has not improved with other cancer treatments or has relapsed. 
DANYELZA for Pediatric Relapsed or Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma—Clinical Development Program
DANYELZA has been studied in several clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric R/R NB and other diseases, of which Study 201 and Study 15-096 are currently ongoing. The accelerated approval of DANYELZA by the FDA was based primarily on interim data from Study 201 and Study 12-230.

Treatment Protocol
The Phase 1 portion of Study 12-230 assessed dose escalation of intravenous, or IV, naxitamab (days one, three, five) in the presence of subcutaneous GM-CSF (days minus four through five). These three doses of naxitamab and 10 days of GM-CSF constituted a single treatment cycle. Patients who completed 4 cycles without PD were eligible to continue treatment for up to 24 months. For the Phase 2 part of study, patient were eligible to continue treatment for up to 4 cycles after major clinical response was obtained again with a maximum treatment period of 24 months. 

17



Phase 2 Portion of Study 12-230
The Study 12-230 protocol was amended in May 2016 to include an expansion Phase 2 portion. In October 2020, topline results from the first 71 patients (including 29 patients with no evidence of disease, or NED patients) in this Phase 2 study were presented, which continued to show response rates at the same levels as in the dose escalation part of the study with 13 of 15 evaluable, or 87% of, primary refractory patients responding and 7 of 23 evaluable, or 30% of, secondary refractory patients responding.
The expansion Phase 2 single-arm portion of Study 12-230 was designed to assess the anti NB activity of naxitamab and GM-CSF in patients who presented with lesions that could be objectively measured and/or monitored by 123I-MIBG scans and who were deemed to have measurable disease and be eligible for response classification by the INRC classification incorporating 123I-MIBG scans. These patients were classified as having evaluable disease and consisted of patients that were primary refractory patients or secondary refractory patients. Another group of patients included those with NED but with a high-risk of relapse.

Primary refractory disease is defined as no prior relapse but incomplete response to treatment in BM as documented by histology and/or 123I-MIBG scan. Secondary refractory disease is defined as prior relapse and incomplete response to salvage therapy in BM as documented by histology and/or 123I-MIBG scan. Patients must be older than one year of age.
Treatment Protocol
Study 201 follows the same treatment protocol as described for Study 12-230 above.
We initiated Study 201 to form the primary basis for our BLA, to establish comparability of study population with Study 12-230 and to satisfy the post-marketing requirements by the FDA. The FDA granted approval under the accelerated approval regulation. The post-marketing clinical trial required by the FDA to verify and to further characterize the clinical benefit is our ongoing Study 201, which will enroll a minimum of 80 patients with evaluable disease with a minimal follow-up of 12 months from CR/PR onset and report ORR, DOR, PFS or OS. The ORR is the primary endpoint for the study, DOR is the secondary endpoint, PFS and OS are secondary endpoints in long-term follow up. As of January 1, 2023 we have enrolled 87 patients and we anticipate completing the study no later than March 31, 2027.
Study 16-1643: Naxitamab/GM-CSF Immunotherapy Plus Isotretinoin for Consolidation of First Remission of Patients with High-Risk Neuroblastoma: A Phase 2 Study
Study 16-1643 was a Phase 2 single-arm clinical trial where patients with high-risk NB in first CR/VGPR undergo consolidation with naxitamab and GM-CSF for five cycles and isotretinoin for six cycles. The primary objective of the study was to determine relapse-free survival following treatment with naxitamab combined with GM-CSF and isotretinoin.
A total of 59 patients have completed enrollment in the study which constituted full accrual. The data is currently being evaluated and prepared for publication.
Primary Objective

● | To determine two years relapse-free survival.
--+----------------------------------------------

19



Secondary Objective

● | To determine MRD by using BM specimens.
--+----------------------------------------

Patient Population
In addition to satisfying certain other criteria, patients must have a diagnosis of NB as defined by a) histopathology, or b) BM metastases or MIBG-avid lesion(s) plus high urine catecholamine levels. Patients must have high-risk NB (MYCN amplified Stage 2, 3, 4, and 4S of any age and MYCN-nonamplified Stage 4 in patients above 18 months of age). Patients must be in first CR/VGPR.
Patients will mainly be children and adolescents.
Treatment Protocol
The dosing and regimen for naxitamab and GM-CSF is similar to the protocol in Study 12-230. Naxitamab and GM-CSF is given for five cycles and isotretinoin for six cycles. In addition to naxitamab and GM-CSF, isotretinoin, which has been shown to decrease the risk of relapse in patients treated in CR, is administered at 160mg/m2/d, divided into two doses, for 14 days. This treatment can be repeated after a minimum rest period of 14 days, for a total of six cycles starting after two cycles of naxitamab and GM-CSF unless HAHA develops and precludes timely administration of cycle 2 of naxitamab and GM-CSF. The interval between the end of a treatment cycle of naxitamab and GM-CSF and start of next treatment cycle is two to four weeks through cycle 4, then the interval is up to six to eight weeks until cycle 5.
Safety Results
One patient was reported with an unexpected neuropathic event. The patient suffered from short-term lower limb paralysis that resolved upon hospitalization treatment. 
Study 17-251: Pilot Study of Naxitamab, Irinotecan/Temozolomide and Sargramostim (HITS) Chemoimmunotherapy for High-Risk Neuroblastoma

● | Stage 4 without MYCN amplification (greater than one and a half years of age)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stage 3 with MYCN amplification (unresectable; any age)
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Stage 4S with MYCN amplification (any age)
--+-------------------------------------------

Patients must have a history of tumor progression or relapse or failure to achieve CR following standard therapy. Patients must also have evaluable disease documented after completion of prior systemic therapy.
Treatment Protocol
Each cycle consists of four doses of naxitamab, five doses each of irinotecan and temozolomide and five doses of sargramostim. Irinotecan 50mg/m2/day IV will be administered from day one through five concurrently with temozolomide 150mg/m2/day orally. Naxitamab 2.25mg/kg IV will be administered on days two, four, eight and 10. Sargramostim 250mg/m2/day subcutaneous will be administered from day six through 10. If patients do not experience significant toxicity they will commence a second cycle four to six weeks after the first cycle. If there is no progressive disease and patients do not experience significant toxicity they may receive combination therapy up to two years.
Safety Results
Safety and efficacy data for Study 17-251 were published as an abstract at the June 2022 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Toxicities included myelosuppression and diarrhea as expected with irinotecan/temozolomide, pain and hypertension as expected with naxitamab, plus febrile neutropenia. No other >grade 2 unexpected toxicities occurred, and the treatment was outpatient. In this trial, human anti-human antibody did not develop in any of the 50 patients providing samples for testing.
DANYELZA for the Treatment of Relapsed Osteosarcoma
DANYELZA is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study (Study 15-096) for the treatment of patients with relapsed osteosarcoma that have been rendered surgically free of evident disease. 
Overview of Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignancy of bone, particularly among children and adolescents. It is relatively rare and represents less than one percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. According to the ACS, most osteosarcomas occur in children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 30. In young patients, it most often arises in the metaphyses of long bones, such as the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.
Each year, approximately 1,000 new patients are diagnosed with osteosarcoma in the United States. Assuming similar prevalence as in the United States, we estimate that approximately 1,500 patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma per year in Europe. 
DANYELZA for Relapsed Osteosarcoma—Current Treatment Landscape and Associated Limitations
Current treatment options for front-line and relapsed osteosarcoma consist of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of the three. Multimodality treatment is increasingly recognized as an important approach for increasing a patient’s chance of prolonged survival. Approximately 50% to 70% of patients treated with aggressive surgical resection and systemic therapy (combination methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy) achieve long-term EFS if they have localized disease at diagnosis. However, as discussed below, the prognosis for patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis or those with relapsed disease is very poor. Over the past three decades, several attempts at improving the prognosis for these patients have achieved little success. Strategies that incorporated dose-intensification of existing agents or addition of other conventional chemotherapeutic agents as well as biological agents, 

21



have not achieved long-term benefit in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma. We believe that at present, there are no novel compounds that have demonstrated activity in relapsed osteosarcoma and few therapeutic options exist for patients with relapsed disease.
The poor prognosis in relapsed osteosarcoma has been confirmed in several reports. A study from the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group reported that while only one of 205 patients with recurrence survived past five years without surgical resection, the five-year OS and EFS rates were 32% and 18% for second recurrence, 26% and 0% for third recurrence, 28% and 13% for fourth recurrence, and 53% and 0% for fifth recurrence, respectively, in which a renewed surgical remission was achieved.
DANYELZA for Relapsed Osteosarcoma—Clinical Development Program
Currently, DANYELZA is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (Study 15-096) for the treatment of relapsed osteosarcoma. This Phase 2 clinical trial is designed to assess the efficacy of DANYELZA when combined with GM-CSF in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma who have been rendered surgically free of evident disease. The study commenced in July 2015, and as of January 2023, 42 patients had been enrolled. This trial is designed to distinguish between a 12-month EFS of 30% versus 50%.
Study 15-096: A Phase 2 Study of Monoclonal Antibody Naxitamab with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) in the Treatment of Recurrent Osteosarcoma
Study 15-096 is a Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy naxitamab combined with GM-CSF, in patients with recurrent osteosarcoma who have been rendered surgically free of evident disease.
Primary Objective

● | To evaluate EFS at 12 months
--+-----------------------------

Secondary Objectives

● | To evaluate time to recurrence, OS and toxicity associated with naxitamab and GM-CSF.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Population
In addition to satisfying certain other criteria, patients must be older than one year and up to 40 years of age. To enroll, patients must have a diagnosis of relapsed osteosarcoma. Patients must also be in or beyond their second CR.
Treatment Protocol
Each cycle of therapy is 10 days. The treatment protocol defined one cycle of treatment with IV naxitamab at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg/dose for three days (days one, three, and five) in the presence of subcutaneous GM-CSF (administered on day minus four before dose one of naxitamab). These three doses of naxitamab with GM-CSF administered subcutaneously before dose one of naxitamab constitute a treatment cycle. Cycles can be repeated at two-to-four-week intervals between the first days of naxitamab, through five cycles. A maximum of five cycles were administered on protocol. No simultaneous anti-cancer therapy was permitted while on study.
Study 205: A Global Randomized Pivotal Trial of Naxitamab Compared to Standard of Care in Patients with Pulmonary Only Recurrent Osteosarcoma
Study 205 is a planned international multicenter randomized pivotal clinical study with naxitamab compared to Standard of Care in patients with Pulmonary Only Recurrent Osteosarcoma. We plan to submit an IND for this study in 2023.

Omburtamab Overview
Omburtamab is a novel murine monoclonal antibody designed for compartmental immunotherapy, for example in the CNS. Omburtamab targets B7-H3, an immune checkpoint molecule that is widely expressed in tumor cells of several types of cancers, including pediatric CNS/LM from NB. We have radiolabeled omburtamab with either Iodine-131 (131I-omburtamab) or Iodine-124 (124I-omburtamab). 131I-omburtamab was granted BTD by the FDA based on investigator blinded reviewed radiographical imaging. In 2016, 131I-omburtamab was granted ODD and RPDD, in each case, for the treatment of NB. The RPDD qualifies us for receipt of a PRV upon approval of omburtamab for treatment of NB, if such approval occurs. An analysis of 107 patients treated through June 2019 demonstrated median OS of 50.8 months (including a five-year median OS of approximately 44%), as compared to historical median OS of approximately six to nine months.
We submitted a BLA to the FDA for radiolabeled 131I-omburtamab for central nervous system, or CNS, leptomeningeal metastases, or LM, from NB in August 2020, and received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA in October 2020. The reason for the FDA’s decision to issue the Refusal to File letter was that upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that certain parts of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control, or CMC Module and the Clinical Module of the BLA required further detail. Among other things, the FDA requested that detailed validation data be included in the CMC Module, that clinical study data and external control data be reanalyzed using a propensity score adjusted analysis for important baseline characteristics, such as prior receipt of irradiation, and that further supportive evidence in the form of direct anti-tumor effect be included in the Clinical Module. We held a number of Type B meetings with the agency, including a pre-BLA meeting in January 2022, before we resubmitted the BLA for omburtamab in March 2022. In October 2022 we met with the FDA and ODAC, who reviewed 131I-omburtamab and voted 16 to 0 that we had not provided sufficient evidence to conclude that omburtamab improves overall survival. In November 2022 the FDA issued a CRL for the BLA. In the CRL for omburtamab and in our Type A meeting held subsequent to receipt of the CRL, the FDA made recommendations for us to consider in terms of trial design to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness and a favorable benefit-risk profile. We are currently considering the future for our omburtamab development program and we can provide no assurance that the development of omburtamab will continue or that omburtamab will ultimately receive FDA approval.
B7-H3 Overview
B7-H3 is a member of the B7 family of immune regulatory ligands. The family includes B7-1, B7-2, PD-L1, PD-L2, B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H6 and their ligands on T-cells PD-1, CD28, CTLA-4 and ICOS. B7-H3 is highly expressed on many solid cancers and displays high-tumor-versus normal tissue binding differential. In mice, studies have shown that members of the B7 family have the capability to regulate the immune system through both stimulatory and inhibitory signals. Inhibition of certain members of the B7 family has been shown to have significant anti-tumor effects in several solid tumor types. As such, we believe that B7-H3 is a promising target for designing targeted therapeutics with a range of modalities.
B7-H3 Expression in Various Cancer Types
Studies have shown that B7-H3 is highly expressed on a variety of solid cancer tumors, including prostate, ovarian, breast, colon, renal, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, head and neck cancers, as well as melanoma, glioblastoma, and NB and other small round blue cell tumors of childhood. In addition, a high degree of B7-H3 expression on solid tumors has been correlated with greater disease severity, poor outcomes and worse median OS in a number of these cancer types.
We believe there is a large market opportunity for the treatment of solid tumors that express B7-H3, with hundreds of thousands of new cases estimated in the United States each year. Based on our review of published research, we believe that B7-H3 expression occurs in a range of 70% to 100% of tumor samples for various cancer types, which makes B7-H3 a promising immunotherapy target. Our literature review also revealed that B7-H3 expression on the systemic tumor is replicated in the metastasized tumor. While our clinical development efforts for omburtamab has been focused on rare pediatric cancers, we believe we have the potential to expand omburtamab’s application to both the treatment of CNS/LM from solid tumors that express B7-H3 and certain underlying solid systemic tumors. As part of 

23



Study 03-133, we also treated a small number of adult patients with solid tumors that have metastasized to the CNS/LM compartment with 131I-omburtamab.
131I-omburtamab Mechanism of Action
131I-omburtamab is a monoclonal antibody that is radiolabeled with Iodine-131, and targets B7-H3. Upon administration, radiolabeled omburtamab binds selectively to B7-H3 ligand that is expressed on the tumor cell surface. Iodine-131 emits beta radiation, resulting in deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, damage and tumor cell death. Beta radiation from iodine isotopes penetrates 1-3 mm, affecting not only the antibody bound cell but also the neighboring tumor cells. Iodine-131 has a half-life of eight days. Iodine-131 emits electrons. Radiolabeling of omburtamab with Iodine-131 takes place at qualified radio pharmacies according to a well-established procedure.
131I-omburtamab for the Treatment of Pediatric Central Nervous System/Leptomeningeal Metastases from Neuroblastoma
131I-omburtamab has been studied for the treatment of pediatric CNS/LM from NB, and was granted BTD in this indication in 2017. In 2016, 131I-omburtamab was granted ODD and RPDD, in each case, for the treatment of NB. The RPDD qualifies us for receipt of a PRV upon approval of omburtamab for treatment of NB, if such approval occurs. As of June 2019, 107 patients with pediatric CNS/LM from NB had been treated with 131I-omburtamab in Study 03-133. An analysis of these 107 patients demonstrated a median OS of 50.8 months (including an estimated five-year OS of approximately 44%), as compared to historical median OS of approximately six months. 131I-omburtamab can be administered as a push injection in an outpatient setting.
Overview of Central Nervous System/Leptomeningeal Metastases from Neuroblastoma
CNS/LM is a rare and usually fatal complication of NB in which the disease spreads to the membranes, or meninges, surrounding the brain and spinal cord in the CNS. It is expected that the incidence of CNS/LM from NB disease will increase concurrently with better treatment options for systemic NB, as more patients achieve longer systemic remissions allowing for more CNS relapses. Relapsed metastatic NB is difficult to treat particularly in patients with R/R NB who have CNS/LM from NB. The median OS after detection of the CNS/LM from NB is approximately six months even with early detection and intervention.
Approximately 700 children are diagnosed with NB in the United States each year. Of these, approximately 50-60% are high-risk, and of those at high-risk who relapse, we believe approximately 20% will suffer from CNS/LM from NB. A published study analyzing frozen sections from tumors with histologically confirmed diagnosis of NB using immunohistochemistry showed 87 out of 90 sections (or approximately 97%) were B7-H3 positive. We believe the European market is at least one and a half times the size of the U.S. market and that there are approximately 1,050 patients diagnosed with NB in Europe each year.
131I-omburtamab for Pediatric Central Nervous System/Leptomeningeal Metastases from Neuroblastoma—Current Treatment Landscape and Associated Limitations
There are currently no approved products for patients with R/R NB who have CNS/LM from NB. A variety of treatments are used alone and in combination with other treatments. It is widely accepted that no effective treatment regimens for CNS/LM from NB are available, and the goals of treatment are generally palliative. For recurrence in the CNS, the therapeutic approach consists primarily of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. These treatments have had very limited success, with median OS of approximately six months. The current standard of care treatment paradigm typically involves the following:

● | Surgery—for debulking the tumor prior to irradiation and chemotherapy and to reduce edema and hemorrhage;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Radiation—focal, craniospinal or whole brain irradiation used for symptom alleviation, cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, flow correction or for debulking to facilitate chemotherapy; and/or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




● | Chemotherapy—standard combinations of chemotherapy such as irinotecan and temozolomide.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The uniformly poor outcomes associated with these different regimens highlight the significant unmet medical need for treatment of CNS/LM from NB:

1. | Our review of published research representing 83 patients treated between 1979 and 2013 showed a median OS of 5.6 months (95% CI of three to eight months) for patients with R/R NB who have CNS/LM from NB. We also performed a restricted analysis after removing patients who died before receiving therapy for the CNS/LM from NB disease and only received palliative treatment, or who presented with rapidly progressing systemic disease. The restricted analysis comprised of 58 patients with a median OS of 8.7 months (95% CI of 5.8 to 11 months) after diagnosis of CNS/LM from NB. There were only three cases of survival beyond three years.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Data from 85 patients sourced from The Central German Childhood Cancer Registry, or CGCCR, showed a median OS of 4.7 months. The data was extracted from patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2010. It is estimated that more than 90% of all German childhood cancer patients are registered in this database.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Finally, our review of data from 19 patients treated at MSK prior to when 131I-omburtamab was first introduced in 2004, demonstrated a median OS of 5.5 months.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

131I-omburtamab for Pediatric Central Nervous System/Leptomeningeal Metastases from Neuroblastoma—Clinical Development Program
131I-omburtamab for the treatment of pediatric CNS/LM from NB is a potential monotherapy after patients have completed standard of care treatment. As of January 2021, 177 patients with pediatric CNS/LM from NB had been treated with 131I-omburtamab in Study 03-133 which closed for recruitment in the third quarter of 2019. As of January 2023, we have treated a total of 52 patients in a multi-center pivotal Phase 2 trial (Study 101) the purposes of analyzing pharmacokinetic and dosimetry comparability between study sites using 131I-omburtamab from our cGMP commercial manufacturer, versus drug product previously produced by and used in earlier studies at MSK. Both studies are closed for recruitment but several patients are still attending follow-up.
Study 03-133: Phase 1/2 Study of Intrathecal Radioimmunotherapy using 131I-omburtamab for Central Nervous System/Leptomeningeal Neoplasms
The trial was originally designed as a Phase 1/2 clinical dose escalation study followed by cohort expansion at the recommended dose. To determine the MTD, patients received up to 70 millicurie, or mCi, 131I-omburtamab in an outpatient setting. No DLTs were experienced in the dose escalation part. Based on treatment results the 50 mCi dose to treat NB with CNS/LM metastasis was chosen for the expansion cohort as implemented by a protocol amendment. Study 03-133 was closed for recruitment in the third quarter of 2019. As of January 2021, 177 patients had been treated with 131I-omburtamab in the study. Of these, 107 patients were diagnosed with pediatric CNS/LM metastasis from NB. The study is closed for recruitment but several patients are still attending follow-up.
Patient Population
In addition to satisfying certain other criteria, patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a malignancy known to be reactive to omburtamab, a B7-H3 binding antibody. Furthermore, patients must have CNS/LM from NB disease which is refractory to conventional therapies or for which no conventional therapy exists, or a relapsed brain tumor with a predilection for LM dissemination (primitive neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdoid tumor, medulloblastoma).
Before enrollment in Study 03-133, most patients underwent biopsy or debulking surgery to remove brain metastases as much as possible, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. A majority of the patients were also treated with an anti-GD2 immunotherapy such as naxitamab to control systemic disease after completing the 

25



131I-omburtamab treatment under Study 03-133. All patients had an intraventricular device implanted before enrollment in the study.
Approximately 80% of all CNS/LM from NB patients presenting at MSK since the initiation of the study were included in the study and the remaining patients were primarily excluded due to the fact that they had already received the maximum dose of previous radiotherapy to CNS, or had progressive systemic disease.
Treatment Protocol
Patients are treated with up to two cycles (each consisting of a treatment dose and a dosimetry dose) of 131I-omburtamab administered through intrathecal infusion via an Ommaya reservoir by which the drug is distributed at the intrathecal space to the entire CSF, (as shown in the figure on the left below). A treatment cycle with 131I-omburtamab under Study 03-133 proceeds as follows:

● | Week 1: 131I-omburtamab (dosimetry dose: 2 mCi imaging test dose);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Week 2: 131I-omburtamab (treatment dose: 30-50 mCi depending on age);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Weeks 3 and 4: observation period; and
--+---------------------------------------


● | Week 5: post-treatment evaluation comprised of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of the head and spine, CSF cytology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The diagram on the left depicts how our radiolabeled omburtamab can be administered via the Ommaya reservoir and catheter into the deep ventricles of the brain where the CSF is produced. From the ventricles, our radiolabeled omburtamab will flow with the CSF and spread throughout the entire CNS compartment potentially binding and killing B7-H3 positive cancer cells it may find on its way. The diagram on the right is a PET scan showing the distribution of our radiolabeled omburtamab two hours after administration where it has flowed from the central ventricles throughout the entire CNS compartment.
Primary Objective

● | To define the clinical toxicities of intrathecal 131I-omburtamab.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

26



Secondary Objective

● | To collect neurocognitive and long-term follow-up data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Safety Results
No MTD was reached in the dose escalation portion of the trial. Although not a DLT, myelosuppression was observed in patients who had received craniospinal radiation and 131I-omburtamab at dose levels six and seven (60 and 70 mCi, respectively). As a result, a dose of 50 mCi was chosen for the expansion cohort. Among the 107 patients treated with 131I-omburtamab and diagnosed with pediatric CNS/LM metastasis from NB, a total of 340 injections were administered and myelosuppression was observed in approximately 88 patients. No increased risk of radionecrosis was observed.
As of September 2018, 29% of the patients had an SAE that was considered related to treatment by the investigator. The SAEs considered related by investigator were mainly in the System organ Class: investigations reflecting 131I mediated myelosuppression, which were considered related for the majority of the events. Related SAEs of vomiting were reported in five patients (3.4%), headache and meningitis chemical by four patients (2.7%) each.
Efficacy Results
Data reported as of June 2019 indicate that the median OS for the 107 patients diagnosed with pediatric CNS/LM metastasis from NB and treated under Study 03-133 was 50.8 months. Based on calculations per the Kaplan-Meier Plot, the estimated three-year OS of these 107 patients is 56% and the estimated five-year OS and ten-year OS is 44%, and 38%, respectively.
Comparison of Median Overall Survival (Months)

(2) | 131I-omburtamab = Patients diagnosed with pediatric CNS/LM metastasis from NB treated under Study 03-133.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The figure above compares median OS data from Study 03-133 with historical controls. Historical patient data extracted from three sources revealed median OS of 8.7 months in the literature, 4.7 months in the German NB Trials, and 5.5 months in the MSK historical cohort prior to the introduction of 131I-omburtamab treatment. These results further 

27



demonstrate the lack of an established, effective therapy for these patients that we believe can potentially be addressed by 131I-omburtamab.
The chart below shows the historical comparable data and median OS following the introduction of 131I-omburtamab treatment. This represents 107 treated patients from Study 03-133 diagnosed with pediatric CNS/LM metastasis from NB, as at June 2019. The estimated three-year median OS was 56% and the five-year median OS was 44%. Survivors have been followed for up to 14 years.

Study 101: A Multicenter Phase 2 Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of Intracerebroventricular Radioimmunotherapy using 131I-omburtamab for Neuroblastoma Central Nervous System/Leptomeningeal Metastases
Study 101 is a pivotal Phase 2 single-arm, Open-Label, non-randomized, multi-center efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and dosimetry trial of intracerebroventricular 131I-omburtamab in pediatric patients with R/R NB who have CNS/LM from NB. Patients will receive up to two cycles of 131I-omburtamab. This study commenced in the second quarter of 2018, and as of January 2023, we have treated a total of 52 patients in a multi-center pivotal Phase 2 trial (Study 101) for an interim analysis for the purposes of pharmacokinetic and dosimetry comparability between study sites using 131I-omburtamab from our cGMP commercial manufacturer, versus drug product previously produced by MSK. Study 101 has also been designed to satisfy potential confirmatory study and post-marketing requirement by the FDA, and, as a result, we will continue to follow the patients in the study. Study 101 is closed for recruitment but several patients are still in follow-up.
Safety and efficacy data will be investigated with short-term follow up at 26 weeks after treatment and with long-term follow up for up to three years following treatment. Final analysis will be performed when at least 50 treated patients have completed long-term follow up (three years or until death).
Median OS at three years and its 95% CI will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Efficacy will be achieved if the lower limit of the 95% CI of three-year median OS exceeds 10%. PFS will also be analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods.
Patient Population
In addition to satisfying certain other criteria, patients must be less than 18 years of age at the time of screening. Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of CNS/LM from NB with relapse.

28



Treatment Protocol
A single treatment cycle will last five weeks and will include premedication, intracerebroventricular 131I-omburtamab administration (one dosimetry dose and one treatment dose), an observation period, and post-treatment evaluations (see figure below). The dosimetry dose will be used only for the first 24 patients.
One 131I-omburtamab treatment cycle for Study 101

Patients without objective PD are eligible for a second dosing cycle.
Primary Objective

● | To determine OS rate at three years.
--+-------------------------------------

Secondary Objectives

● | To determine ORR up to three years.
--+------------------------------------


● | To assess PFS at six months after the first therapeutic dose of 131I-omburtamab.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To assess radiation doses delivered to the blood and CSF.
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | To assess the frequency, type, of adverse events and human anti-mouse antibodies, or HAMA, response formation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To assess the effects on cognitive functions.
--+----------------------------------------------

We originally initiated Study 101 to form the primary basis for our BLA, to establish comparability of study population and pharmacokinetics analysis with Study 03-133 and to satisfy potential confirmatory study and post-marketing requirements by the FDA. We submitted to a BLA for omburtamab in 2022. In November 2022, we received a CRL for the BLA. For additional details, see “Item 1. – Business – omburtamab.”
Humanized Omburtamab Overview
We have an early stage development program for huB7-H3, a humanized version of omburtamab, for potential clinical testing in adult patients with B7-H3 positive solid tumors where systemic immunotherapy is needed. The program seeks to explore the use of huB7-H3 as a radio-conjugated antibody designed to overcome limitations of murine antibodies that may induce HAMA, which may lead to decreased efficacy and increased toxicity when used for systemic immunotherapy.
GD2-GD3 Vaccine Overview
Neuroectoderm-derived tumors, including NB and sarcomas, have high expression of tumor antigens GD2 and GD3. Our investigational bivalent GD2-GD3 Vaccine has been studied in a Phase 2 study (Study 05-075) conducted at MSK for the immunization of high-risk NB patients previously treated with DANYELZA. In addition, MSK has started 

29



a new Phase 2 study (Study 21-206) of the GD2-GD3 Vaccine with the immunological adjuvant OPT-821 (QS-21), in combination with oral ß-glucan and randomization of GM-CSF, for the immunization of high-risk NB patients. The vaccine, in combination with adjuvants, is being studied to induce patients to produce their own anti-GD2 and anti-GD3 serum titers, with the goal of preventing subsequent relapse. Although MSK is pursuing clinical development of the GD2-GD3 Vaccine, and we are providing only limited support for Study 21-206, this program was deprioritized by us as part of the 2023 restructuring plan, and we are not devoting significant financial resources to this program.
SADA Technology - Liquid RadiationTM
The SADA technology, also referred to as Liquid RadiationTM, represents a 2-step pre-targeting radio immune therapy (pRIT). The radiation payload is encaged into a carrier molecule (DOTA) which in non-clinical setting has been demonstrated specifically to bind to the DOTA binding domain of the SADA molecule. Such payload deliveries have been achieved in non-clinical in-vivo settings, where xenograft tumors have been shown to shrink or completely disappear, with less exposure to other tissues. No clearing agent is needed, and no significant toxicity to bone marrow, kidneys or liver tissues has been observed in the non-clinical settings. Based on non-clinical data, we believe that the SADA technology may allow for rapid clearance of the unbound compound, while maintaining target uptake, and thereby causing optimal tumor to normal tissue ratio. As SADA reflects a humanized protein structure, less immunogenicity is expected. In addition, the SADA technology appears to be modular, embracing a tumor-binding domain, a DOTA binding domain and a tetramerization domain. Hence, DOTA-modified radioactive payloads combined with different tumor-binding domains seems possible.
We are using the SADA Technology to advance a series of antibody constructs based on the SADA technology, with the initial approach using 177Lu-DOTA as the radioactive payload (b-emitter) We believe the SADA technology could potentially improve the efficacy of radiolabeled therapeutics in tumors that have not historically demonstrated meaningful responses to radiolabeled agents.
GD2-SADA
Our first SADA molecule to enter clinical development is GD2-SADA for potential use in GD2 positive solid tumors. The IND for GD2-SADA is open and four clinical sites in the U.S are open for enrollment.
In the first in human clinical Phase 1 trial (Study 1001), GD2-SADA is administered at various timepoints before administration of 177Lu-DOTA payload. The trial will be composed of three serial parts. The first part addresses optimization of protein doses and spacing between SADA protein administration and payload administration. The second part addresses optimal, safe levels of the payload delivery. In the third part, repeated exposures are investigated in order to monitor long-term safety signals. 
Patient populations to be exposed in Study 1001 include those patients with small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, melanoma or one of several types of sarcomas, including osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, Ewing and angiosarcomas that can all be enrolled in the study. The target, disialoganglioside GD2, has limited expression in normal human tissues though it is expressed on peripheral neurons, central nervous system and skin melanocytes. It is highly expressed in the targeted indications.

30



Overview of SCLC
GD2 is highly expressed in SCLC. In addition, data for a radio-conjugated anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (antibody 3F8, with similar scFv as GD2-SADA) demonstrated binding in 10 of 10 patients with SCLC. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women, with an estimate of more than 200,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States. SCLC accounts for approximately 13% to 15% of all lung cancers. This high-grade neuroendocrine tumor is characterized by rapid growth and early development of metastases to both regional lymph nodes and distant sites, including the central nervous system. SCLC generally has a poor prognosis, and less than 5% of patients with extensive disease survive two years or more. Currently, the only approved first-line treatment approach for extensive disease, or ED, in SCLC is platinum-based chemotherapy with or without the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Second line therapies can include topotecan and lubinectidin. There is no approved therapeutic agent for patients with progressive SCLC following second-line treatment.
Overview of Sarcomas
Sarcomas are a group of cancers which arise in the bones and connective tissue. GD2 is highly expressed in several sarcomas including osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, angiosarcomas and Ewing sarcoma. Patients with any of these types of sarcomas are eligible to be enrolled into Study 1001.
Overview of osteosarcomas
Osteosarcoma is the most common type of cancer that arises in bone, accounting for two-thirds of all bone cancer cases. Most osteosarcomas occur in children, adolescents, and young adults. The treatment approach has not changed significantly over the past three decades. Conventional treatment regimens typically include neoadjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, cisplatin) followed by surgical resection and reconstruction (with the goal of limb salvage) and adjuvant chemotherapy.
Overview of soft tissue sarcoma
The incidence of new soft tissue sarcomas is estimated to approximately 13,460 in the United States in 2023. GD2 is highly expressed in soft tissue sarcomas. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Different therapeutic approaches targeting GD2 in sarcoma are in early clinical development. For patients with localized disease at diagnosis the 5-year survival rate is approximately 80%. However, this survival rate declines to only 15% for patients with metastatic disease.
Overview of angiosarcoma
Angiosarcoma is an aggressive subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma. It is rare, representing <1% of soft-tissue sarcomas. The origin is the endothelial cell of blood or lymphatic vessels. It can affect any organ throughout the body, but the cutaneous form is the most common with the skin of the head and neck region, a frequent tumor location. Angiosarcoma can occur at any age, but the median age at diagnosis is 60-70 years. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The response to therapy is impacted location and size of the tumor, but generally the prognosis is poor with 5-year survival rates ranging from 12% to 35%.
Overview of Ewing sarcoma
Ewing sarcoma is a rare malignancy that occurs primarily in the bone or in the soft tissue around a bone. The tumor is most common in older children and adolescents, but it can occur at any age. Ewing sarcoma accounts for about 1% of all childhood cancers and approximately 200-250 children and adolescents in the United States are diagnosed with a tumor in the Ewing family of tumors each year. Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The response to therapy is dependent on the stage of the tumor. The 5-year survival rates range from 81% for patients with localized disease to 38% for patients with metastatic disease.

31



Overview of malignant melanoma
GD2 is expressed in the majority of melanomas. Melanoma is an uncommon type of skin cancer that arises in the epidermis from melanocytes. It accounts for approximately 1% of all skin cancers but accounts for approximately 75% of deaths from skin cancers. In one estimate, in 2021, the incidence in the United States of newly diagnosed melanomas was approximately 106,000 and approximately 7,000 people were projected to die from melanoma in the United States. 
​
Treatment is dependent on the extent of disease. Excision is the treatment for Stage 0 and Stage I melanomas. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, or SLNB, may be done for Stage I and Stage II disease. A positive SLNB may lead to adjuvant treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or targeted drug therapy. Treatment for Stage III and Stage IV disease is based on the location and extent of disease. The primary tumor is usually excised, followed by adjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, high-dose interleukin-2 or targeted therapy drugs; and local treatments e.g. radiation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors include the anti-PD1 antibodies nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab. Targeted therapies include treatments for melanoma with mutations in the BRAF gene, including vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib. Chemotherapy may be used to treat refractory or recurrent Stage IV disease, most commonly temozolomide or Dacarbazine. Recurrent disease is treated in a similar manner to Stage IV disease.
Treatment Protocol
​
Clinical Trial 1001; Phase 1 trial with GD2-SADA:177Lu-DOTA Complex in adult patients with recurrent or refractory metastatic solid tumors known to express GD2, including SLCA, sarcoma and malignant melanoma. An estimated 60 participants will participate in the trial and we expect that this trial will initially run in the United States. The IND is open and we began activating clinical trial sites in the fourth quarter of 2022.
​
The trial is planned as a Phase 1 trial with three parts, A, B and C. Escalation in this trial will be based on a classical 3+3 trial design. Part A is a GD2-SADA dose escalation phase, in which patients will receive one treatment cycle. Part B is a 177Lu-DOTA dose escalation phase, in which patients will receive up to 2 treatment cycles. Part C is a repeated dosing phase where the doses determined in Part A and B will be administered. Patients will receive repeated treatment cycles with a maximum of 5 cycles.
​
Primary Objectives

CD38-SADA
We are preparing for a planned IND submission for our CD38-SADA as the second SADA construct and anticipate IND submission in 2023. This trial would be a first in human, dose-escalation, open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial (Study 1201) investigating the safety and tolerability of the CD38 SADA:177Lu-DOTA Drug Complex in Relapsed or Refractory non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. We currently expect that the trial is will be conducted at sites in the United States assuming the IND is cleared.

MULTI-TAG Technology 
We believe that our non-exclusive access to the MULTI-TAG technology will help us make further advances to our BsAb program by optimizing BiTEs. While there has been significant enthusiasm for BiTEs given their high potency and ability to penetrate more efficiently than conventional IgG-like BsAbs, their efficacy remains hampered by their size and binding characteristics. BiTEs are relatively small in size, approximately 55kD, resulting in a short serum half-life given rapid renal clearance. As a result, they require continuous infusion for several weeks in order to achieve a therapeutic response. They also bind monovalently, which often results in suboptimal tumor-binding. Further, therapeutic dosing of BiTEs is limited by the risk of excessive cytokine release in patients.
Using the MULTI-TAG technology, we have designed a novel protein tag of human origin that dimerizes, or links, BiTEs, in a unique conformation, which we believe may result in improved tumor-binding, a longer half-life, and greater T-cell mediated tumor cell killing. We are using the MULTI-TAG technology platform to dimerize our BsAbs into proteins of approximately 120kD in size, thereby increasing serum half-life without the need for continuous infusion. The unique dimerized conformation, while binding bivalently to tumors, also binds monovalently to T-cells, which we believe, leads to limiting excessive cytokine release. 
Manufacturing
Currently, we contract with third-party cGMP vendors for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and commercial supply. We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities to produce clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing third parties with whom we currently work may need to increase their scale of production or we may need to secure alternate suppliers. Although we rely on our cGMP manufacturers, we have personnel with substantial manufacturing experience to oversee our relationships with such manufacturers.
Manufacturing clinical and commercial products is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our vendors are required to comply with cGMP regulations, which are regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA and other regulatory bodies like the EMA to assure proper design, monitoring and control of manufacturing processes and facilities for human pharmaceuticals. We have established an in-house quality assurance, or QA, function with a certified Qualified Person to perform final release of our product for both clinical and commercial supply.
Our current product candidates are mainly manufactured based on well-established technology known from mAb products. These manufacturing processes involve the genetic engineering of a parental host cell line to isolate a cell that produces the target product. Once a cell line is isolated, a cell bank is produced under prescribed and documented conditions. The cell bank, preserved frozen, is tested, as required by regulations, to demonstrate that the engineered cell line is free from potentially harmful impurities and contaminants, such as viruses.
The drug substance is an active ingredient that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the human body. The manufacturing process for the drug substance begins with the thaw of vials from the cell bank and growth of these cells in established media until sufficient cells are cultured to inoculate a production bioreactor. The cells in the production bioreactor are grown in chemical defined media and under controlled and monitored conditions that stimulate the production of the antibody into the culture media. The production bioreactor is cultured for an established period of time and is then harvested by filtration to remove the cells from the culture media.
The solution containing the product is purified through several steps to remove known process and product derived impurities. The technologies employed include ultrafiltration and column and membrane chromatography. Additional steps are performed to inactivate or remove viruses. The final step of the drug substance process adjusts the antibody concentration and produces the final formulation to be used for drug product production. The drug substance is tested to meet pre-established product specific release criteria for purity, potency and safety, and is then periodically 

33



tested to demonstrate stability upon storage as required by regulations. The drug substance is stored at prescribed temperatures, typically refrigerated or frozen.
The drug product is produced by sterilization filtration of the drug substance solution, followed by aseptic filling into glass vials and then stoppered. The drug product is subjected to product specific release testing for purity, potency and safety according to pre-established specifications. Drug product lots are periodically tested to demonstrate stability over the established storage expiry period. The drug product is stored and shipped under temperature-controlled conditions, typically refrigerated, to sites designated for clinical trial testing, or eventually to commercial pharmaceutical logistics providers.
DANYELZA is a recombinant humanized IgG1κ monoclonal antibody against GD2 expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary, or CHO, cells. A one mL ampoule from the cell bank is used to establish material for seeding of 1,000 L fed batch bioreactor in chemical defined media with no animal derived component. After growth of the cells are completed the un-processed bulk from the bioreactor containing the DANYELZA drug substance undergoes clarification by filtration, and subsequent multi-step product purification. The DANYELZA drug substance is manufactured by Patheon Biologics B.V. in Groningen, The Netherlands and the DANYELZA drug product is manufactured at Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC in Greenville, North Carolina, (both part of the Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., group of companies) collectively Patheon/Thermo Fisher. All manufacturing activities are performed in compliance with cGMP regulations and no excipients of human or animal origin have been used. The DANYELZA drug product is packaged in 10 mL ISO 10R glass vials and refrigerated.
While we believe that Patheon/Thermo Fisher is capable of producing sufficient quantities of drug product to support our clinical and commercial supply for DANYELZA, we also believe that there are a number of alternative third-party manufacturers that have similar capabilities that would be capable of providing sufficient quantities of drug product. However, should Patheon/Thermo Fisher not be able to provide sufficient quantities of drug product for our planned clinical trials or commercial sales, we would be required to seek and then qualify another contract manufacturer to provide this drug product, likely resulting in a delay in such trials and loss of, or delayed, commercial sales.
The GD2-SADA is manufactured at Rentschler Biopharma SE, Laupheim, Germany, using traditional manufacturing and control principles for monoclonal antibodies. The DOTA chemical is sourced as a GMP bulk product and is being filled into a sterile intermediate at Patheon/Thermo Fisher in Ferentino, Italy. Radiolabeling of the DOTA intermediate with Lu-177 is performed at ABX Advanced Biochemical Compounds – Biomedizinische Forschungsreagenzien GmbH, Radeberg, Germany, and final released product is delivered directly to clinical sites. 
Commercialization Plan
The sales call points for DANYELZA in the United States are highly concentrated. This enables us to effectively service our customers and call points with a small commercial organization.
Our management team understands the complexity of rare oncological diseases and we believe we have the necessary expertise to be a true partner to patients, caregivers, and advocacy and healthcare teams leading to shared success. As we advance our product pipeline to address larger patient populations, we intend to expand our specialty sales force and continue the development of our organizational infrastructure to support the network of relevant hospitals, cancer centers, oncologists and other physicians as well as continue to provide support to patients, care givers and other healthcare providers. We plan to commercialize any potential future pediatric product candidates in the United States ourselves, and will continue to evaluate strategic collaborations in select territories in order to maximize the potential of our product and product candidates.
As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. The size of the development programs, size of the target market, size of a commercial infrastructure, and manufacturing needs may all influence our strategies in the United States, the European Union and other parts of the world.

Commercialization Partnerships 
After the approval of DANYELZA by the FDA, we have entered a number of strategic collaborations in the form of partnerships with select companies to maximize the potential value for the Company. In November 2020, we entered into an exclusive license and distribution agreement for DANYELZA and omburtamab with Takeda Israel, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited covering the State of Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip, and in September 2022, DANYELZA was approved for commercialization in Israel. In December 2020, we entered into a distribution agreement for DANYELZA and omburtamab with Swixx BioPharma AG for the Eastern European territories Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia. Finally, later in December 2020, we entered into a license agreement for DANYELZA and omburtamab with SciClone for Greater China, including Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. In July 2021, SciClone submitted a BLA for DANYELZA for the treatment of patients with R/R high-NB to the NMPA of China and the BLA was approved in December 2022. In May 2021, we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Adium Pharma S.A., or Adium, to be the exclusive distributor in Latin America of DANYELZA and omburtamab. Adium submitted regulatory filings for DANYELZA in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia in 2022. In December 2022, we announced a distribution agreement with WEP in connection with an early access program for DANYELZA in Europe.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally, and the cancer drug sector specifically, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, evolving understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidates and our knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial potential competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
In addition to the current standard of care for patients, commercial and academic clinical trials are being pursued by a number of parties in the field of immunotherapy. Early results from these trials have fueled continued interest in immunotherapy, which is being pursued by several biotechnology companies as well as by large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical studies, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
With respect to DANYELZA, which targets GD2-positive tumors, United Therapeutics Corporation, or United Therapeutics, has commercialized Unituxin (dinutuximab), an antibody against GD2, in the United States, Canada and Japan. Although United Therapeutics has discontinued its efforts to investigate Unituxin’s potential activity against adult cancerous tumors, its efforts to develop a humanized version of Unituxin and plans to develop Unituxin within R/R NB, DANYELZA faces competition from Qarziba® (dinutuximab beta) a similar antibody product against GD2 developed by Apeiron Biologics AG, or Apeiron. EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd., or EUSA, has acquired global commercialization rights to Qarziba® (dinutuximab beta), and it is currently being commercialized in Europe and was approved by the EMA to treat high-risk NB and R/R NB. In January 2020, EUSA and BeiGene Ltd., or BeiGene, announced an exclusive collaboration to commercialize Qarziba® in mainland China and in August 2021 EUSA and BeiGene announced that the China NMPA had granted Qarziba® (dinutuximab beta) conditional marketing approval for the treatment of high-risk NB and R/R NB. EUSA has previously announced plans to file for registration of dinutuximab beta in the United States for the treatment of R/R NB. EUSA was acquired by Recordati Industria Chimica E Farmaceutica S.pA., or Recordati, in March 2022.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We cannot provide any 

38



assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, even if obtained, what the duration of such extension may be.
Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are, unless explicitly expressed, without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurance that any such patent term extension of a non-U.S. patent will be obtained and, even if obtained, the duration of such extension.
As for the immunotherapy products and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technology.
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Generally, as noted above, our in-licensed issued patents in all jurisdictions will expire on dates ranging from 2021 to 2039. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2021 to 2041. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Trademarks
We have obtained USPTO trademark registration of the “Y-mAbs” mark, USPTO and EU trademark registration as well as registration in other jurisdictions of DANYELZA and certain other trademarks that we intend to use to commercialize our product candidates. We currently rely on our registered and unregistered trademarks, trade names and service marks, as well as our domain names and logos, as appropriate, to market our brands and to build and maintain brand recognition. We are seeking to register and will continue to seek to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks, trade names and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as appropriate.
Trade Secrets
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

MSK Agreements
On August 20, 2015, we entered into the MSK License, which grants us a worldwide, sub-licensable license to MSK’s rights in certain patent rights and intellectual property rights related to certain know-how to develop, make and commercialize licensed products and to perform services for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in the field of cancer diagnostics and cancer treatments. The MSK License is exclusive with respect to MSK rights in such patent rights and tangible materials within such know-how, and nonexclusive with respect to MSK’s rights in such know-how and related intellectual property rights. The patents and patent applications covered by the MSK License are directed, in part, to the DANYELZA and omburtamab antibody families, including humanized and chimeric antibodies, as well as MSK’s rights in BsAbs, compositions, and their respective use for immunotherapy. Upon entering into the MSK License in 2015 and in exchange for the licenses thereunder, we paid to MSK an upfront payment of $500,000, issued 1,428,500 shares of our common stock to MSK and agreed to provide certain anti-dilution rights to MSK as further described below. In addition, we are required to pay to MSK certain royalty and milestone payments.
The MSK License requires us to pay to MSK mid to high single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products or the performance of licensed services by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. We are required to pay annual minimum royalties of $80,000 over the royalty term, which amounts are non-refundable but are creditable against royalty payments otherwise due thereunder. Total expensed minimum royalty payments under the MSK License were $1,200,000 in 2016 upon determination that the payment of such minimum royalties was probable and the amount was estimable. We are also obligated to pay to MSK certain clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments under the MSK License, which payments become due upon achievement of the related clinical, regulatory or sales-based milestones. Certain of these clinical and regulatory milestone payments become due at the earlier of completion of the related milestone activity or the date indicated in the MSK License. Total clinical and regulatory milestones potentially due under the MSK License are $2,450,000 and $9,000,000, respectively. There are also sales-based milestones that become due should we achieve certain amounts of sales of licensed products resulting from the license arrangement with MSK, with total potential sales-based milestones potentially due of $20,000,000. As product candidates progress through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization, certain milestone payments will come due either as a result of the milestones having been met or the passage of time even if the milestones have not been met. In addition, to the extent we enter into sublicense arrangements, we are required to pay to MSK a percentage of certain payments that we receive from sublicensees of the rights licensed to us by MSK, which percentage will be based upon the date we receive such payments or the achievement of certain clinical milestones. We have entered into sublicenses and distribution agreements related to DANYELZA and omburtamab under the MSK License with Takeda Israel, Swixx BioPharma AG and SciClone in 2020, with Adium in 2021 and WEP in 2022. 
The terms of the MSK License provide that MSK is entitled to receive 40% of the income generated from the sale of first PRV, and 33% of any income generated from the sale of any subsequent PRV or the sale of other comparable incentives provided by any non-U.S. jurisdiction. We sold the PRV received upon FDA approval of DANYELZA to United Therapeutics for $105 million. Pursuant to the agreement with MSK, we were entitled to retain 60% of the net proceeds from monetization of the PRV, and the remaining 40% was due to MSK. We received our portion of the net proceeds of from the sale of the PRV in the amount of approximately $62.0 million when the transaction was consummated in January 2021.
The MSK License will expire, on a country-by-country basis, and on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product or licensed-service-by-licensed-service basis, on the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire of the patents and patent applications covering such licensed product or service in such country, (ii) the expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory authority for such licensed product or service in such country, or (iii) 15 years from the first commercial sale of such licensed product or service in such country.
MSK may terminate the MSK License upon prior written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, or upon prior written notice if such breach is of a payment obligation. MSK may also terminate the MSK License upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or our conviction of a felony relating to the licensed products, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent right. In addition, we have the right to terminate the MSK License in its entirety at will upon prior written notice to MSK, but if we have commenced the 

40



commercialization of licensed products and/or licensed services we can only terminate at will if we cease all development and commercialization of such licensed products and/or licensed services.
Our failure to meet certain conditions under the MSK License could cause the related license to such licensed product to be canceled and could result in termination of the MSK License by MSK.
On November 10, 2015, we entered into the Sponsored Research Agreement, or the SRA, with MSK pursuant to which we committed to provide aggregate research funding to MSK for a term of five years. The research will be conducted in accordance with a written plan and budget approved by the parties. MSK has granted us a non-exclusive, non-commercial, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use any inventions or discoveries developed by MSK within the scope of the information resulting from the project, for our internal, non-commercial research purposes. We have also been granted both a first option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive commercial license to MSK’s rights in inventions developed by MSK and a first option to negotiate an exclusive license to MSK’s rights in inventions jointly developed by the parties. The SRA was amended on September 12, 2019, and will expire five years from the date of the amendment. The SRA may be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior written notice. 
On September 20, 2016, we entered into a Master Data Services Agreement, or the MDSA, with MSK pursuant to which we committed to make certain payments to MSK annually in exchange for certain services, including transfer of clinical data and databases, regulatory files and other know-how to us by employees at MSK who are specifically assigned to assist with such services to us. The MDSA will expire upon the completion of activities set forth in each project description entered into thereunder; however we have the option to extend the term upon written notice to MSK. Either party may terminate the MDSA upon prior written notice in the event of an uncured material breach. 
On June 21, 2017, we entered into the Investigator-Sponsored Master Clinical Trial Agreement, or the MCTA, as later amended on October 11, 2017, with MSK pursuant to which we committed to provide aggregate funding to MSK up to a certain amount for clinical studies to be conducted at MSK. Each such clinical study will be conducted in accordance with a written plan and budget and protocol approved by the parties. Under the MCTA, we and MSK have granted each other a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, without right to sublicense, to use any inventions or discoveries developed by personnel of each such party, that is within the scope of the information resulting from the relevant study, for the other party’s internal, non-commercial research purposes until such invention is commercially available. We have also been granted a first option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive commercial license to MSK’s rights in inventions or discoveries developed by MSK personnel under this MCTA and a first option to negotiate an exclusive license to MSK’s rights in inventions or discoveries jointly developed by MSK and our personnel under this MCTA. The MCTA will continue in effect through completion of the studies, and may be terminated by either party upon prior written notice. 
On June 27, 2017, we entered into two separate Core Facility Service Agreements, or CFSAs, with MSK pursuant to which we committed to make certain payments to MSK in exchange for certain laboratory services over the term of the CFSAs. Either party may terminate either of these CFSAs for any reason, or for no reason, upon prior written notice. In the event of termination of either of these CFSAs, we will make full payment to MSK for all work performed on, or expenses related to the project up to the date of termination including all non-cancelable obligations following receipt from MSK of any completed or in-process deliverables in connection with the project. 
On November 13, 2017, we entered into the MSK CD33 License, with MSK, which grants us a worldwide, sub-licensable license to MSK’s rights in certain patent rights and intellectual property rights related to certain know-how to develop, make and commercialize licensed products and to perform services for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in the field of cancer diagnostics in connection with certain CD33 antibodies generated in a specific principal investigator’s laboratory at MSK and constructs thereof. The MSK CD33 License is exclusive with respect to such patent rights and tangible materials within such know-how, and nonexclusive with respect to MSK’s rights in such know-how and related intellectual property rights. As product candidates progress through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization, certain milestone payments will come due either as a result of the milestones having been met or the passage of time even if the milestones have not been met. Also, we will owe MSK customary royalties on commercial sales of our approved products, if any. Total potential milestones due under the MSK CD33 License are $550,000, $500,000 and $7,500,000 for clinical, regulatory and sales based milestones, respectively. In 

41



addition, the MSK CD33 License contains minimum royalty payments that become due beginning in year 10 of $40,000 per year over the royalty term, increasing to $60,000 once a patent within the licensed rights is issued, subject to increase and creditable against any royalty payments due based on sales in the future. We are required to pay mid to high single-digit royalties on sales of licensed products. Additionally, the terms of the MSK CD33 License provide that MSK is entitled to receive 25% of any income generated from the sale of any PRV or the sale of other comparable incentives provided by any non-U.S. jurisdiction.
The MSK CD33 License will expire, on a country-by-country basis, and on a licensed product-by-licensed-product or licensed-service-by-licensed-service basis, on the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire of the patents and patent applications covering such licensed product or service in such country, (ii) the expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory authority for such licensed product or service in such country, or (iii) 15 years from the first commercial sale of such licensed product or service in such country.
MSK may terminate the MSK CD33 License upon prior written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, or upon prior written notice if such breach is of a payment obligation. MSK may also terminate the MSK CD33 License upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or our conviction of a felony relating to the licensed products, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent right. In addition, we have the right to terminate the MSK CD33 License in its entirety at will upon prior written notice to MSK, but if we have commenced the commercialization of licensed products and/or licensed services we can only terminate at will if we cease all development and commercialization of such licensed products and/or licensed services.
On December 2, 2019, we entered into the Settlement and Assumption and Assignment, or SAAA, of MSK License and Y-mAbs Sublicense Agreement, or the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense, between us and MabVax dated June 27, 2018, with MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. and MabVax Therapeutics, Inc., or together, MabVax, and MSK, which became effective on December 13, 2019. Pursuant to the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense, MabVax sublicensed to us certain patent rights and know-how for development and commercialization of products for the prevention or treatment of NB by means of administering a bi-valent ganglioside vaccine granted to MabVax, pursuant to an exclusive license agreement dated June 20, 2008 between MabVax and MSK, as amended, or the MabVax/MSK License Agreement.
On March 21, 2019, MabVax filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The essence of the transaction created by the SAAA was for us, in light of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings affecting MabVax, to preserve the MabVax/MSK License Agreement and the rights granted to us under the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense and for us to create a direct relationship with MSK with respect to the rights covered under the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense. Pursuant to the SAAA, MabVax agreed to assume the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense and the MabVax/Y-mAbs License Agreement pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and concurrently to assign both of these agreements to MSK. We remain responsible for any potential downstream payment obligations to MSK related to the GD2-GD3 Vaccine that were specified in the MabVax/MSK License Agreement. This includes the obligation to pay development milestones totaling $1,400,000 and mid single-digit royalty payments to MSK. In addition, if we obtain FDA approval for the GD2-GD3 Vaccine, then we are obligated to file with the FDA for a PRV. The SAAA stipulates that, if we are granted a PRV from the FDA covering a licensed product under the MabVax/Y-mAbs Sublicense and the PRV is subsequently sold, we will pay directly to MabVax and to MSK, respectively, a total of twenty percent of the proceeds from the sale thereof. The MabVax/MSK License Agreement will expire with effect for us, on a country-by-country basis, on the later of the expiration of (i) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country or (ii) the last-to-expire valid claim covering such licensed product rights at the time of and in the country of sale.
On April 15, 2020, we entered into a license agreement, or the SADA License Agreement, with MSK and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain patent and intellectual property rights developed by MSK and MIT to develop, make, and commercialize licensed products and to perform services for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in the field of cancer diagnostics and cancer treatments using SADA-BiDE (2-step Self-Assembly and DisAssembly-Bispecific DOTA-Engaging antibody system) Pre-targeted Radioimmunotherapy Platform, or the SADA Technology, a concept we also refer to as Liquid RadiationTM. The patents and patent applications covered by the SADA License Agreement are directed, in part, to the SADA 

42



Technology, as well as a number of SADA constructs developed by MSK. Upon entering into the SADA License Agreement in April 2020 and in exchange for the licenses, we paid MSK and MIT a cash upfront payment and issued an aggregate of 42,900 shares of our common stock to them. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a cash payment in the amount of $1.0 million to MSK and MIT under the agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made another cash payment in the amount of $1.0 million to MSK and MIT under the agreement.
The SADA License Agreement requires us to pay to MSK and MIT mid to high single-digit royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products or the performance of licensed services by us and our affiliates and sublicensees. We are obligated to pay annual minimum royalties of $40,000, increasing to $60,000 once a patent has been issued, over the royalty term, commencing on the tenth anniversary of the license agreement. These amounts are non-refundable but are creditable against royalty payments otherwise due under the SADA License Agreement.
Under the SADA License, we are also obligated to pay MSK and MIT certain clinical, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments. Certain of the clinical and regulatory milestone payments become due at the earlier of completion of the related milestone activity or the date indicated in the SADA License Agreement. Total clinical and regulatory milestones potentially due under the SADA License Agreement are $4,730,000 and $18,125,000, respectively. There are also sales-based milestones, totaling $23,750,000, that become due should the Company achieve certain amounts of sales of licensed products. In addition, for each of the SADA constructs generated by MSK and sold for the Company by a sublicensee, the Company may pay sales milestones in the total amount up to $60,000,000 based on the achievement of various cumulative net sales made by the sub-licensee. Finally, under the terms of the SADA License, MSK is entitled to receive 25% of any income generated from the sale of any PRV or the sale of other comparable incentives provided by any non-U.S. jurisdiction.
Under the SADA License Agreement, we also committed to funding scientific research at MSK for up to $1,500,000 over the next three years. Accordingly, in October 2020, we entered into a SADA sponsored research agreement with MSK pursuant to which we agreed to fund $1,500,000 in scientific research at MSK over the next three years to related to the intellectual property licensed under the SADA License Agreement. The scientific research took place over a period that commenced in September 2020 and ended in February 2022.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various pre-clinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is begun;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

43




● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of our BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually when significant changes are made.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
A clinical trial involves the administration of the investigational product to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which includes the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for patients or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

● | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human patients with the target disease or condition. In oncology, clinical Phase 1 trials are normally conducted in patients, who have been
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

44




exposed to and failed/relapsed on available standard of care therapies. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of our BLA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within 10 months after it files the application, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA files the application. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request 

45



additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. For a fast-track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast-track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA files the application. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA files the application. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate objective that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical objective that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate objective or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant objectives, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end of Phase 2 meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the 

46



sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the non-clinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross disciplinary review; assigning a cross disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.
​
Fast Track designation, priority review and BTD do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identify of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
When a drug, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development, it can be granted breakthrough therapy designation. The standard for breakthrough therapy designation is not the same as the standard for drug approval, as the clinical evidence needed to support breakthrough designation is of preliminary nature.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, or the PRV Program, is intended to incentivize pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for rare pediatric diseases. A company that obtains approval of an IND or a BLA for a designated rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a PRV from the FDA, which may be redeemed to obtain priority review for a subsequent new drug application or BLA by the owner of such PRV. A PRV is fully transferable and can be sold to any company, who in turn can redeem the PRV for priority review of a marketing application in six 

47



months, compared to the standard timeframe of approximately ten months. A drug that receives a RPDD before September 30, 2024 continues to be eligible for a PRV if the drug is approved before September 30, 2026. Extension beyond these dates will require further Congressional action.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among 

48



other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted regulatory approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities and their business associates and covered contractors that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value to certain physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. No assurance can be given that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in significant fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Further, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
In the European Union, medicinal products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
The various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently into their national laws. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. 
The Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 entered into application on January 31, 2022. The Regulation harmonizes and streamlines clinical trial authorizations, simplifies adverse-event reporting procedures, improves the supervision of clinical trials and increases their transparency. Specifically, the new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States, introduces a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the "EU portal"; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors. A harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials is divided into two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of a reference member state selected by the trial sponsor largely of the type of clinical trial, risk-benefit analysis, and compliance with technical requirements. This assessment, which is valid for the entire EU, is then in Part II submitted to the competent authorities of all the concerned member states in which the trial is to be conducted. 

50



In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 Member States of the European Union, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related marketing authorization has been granted. A company may submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either on the basis of the centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the EMA for scientific review by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The CHMP issues an opinion concerning whether the quality, safety and efficacy of the product has been demonstrated. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for granting a centralized marketing authorization in the form of a binding EC decision. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
National marketing authorizations, which are issued by the competent authorities of EEA countries and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EEA country, this national marketing authorization can be recognized in another EEA country through the mutual recognition procedure. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the EEA countries selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another EEA country, referred to as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any EEA country. Under this procedure the applicant can select the EEA country that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the EEA countries for which marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each Concerned Member State must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment or reject it on the basis of potential serious risk to public health. If the disputed points cannot be resolved, the matter is first referred to the Heads of Medicines Agencies’ Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures for agreement. If the Group cannot reach an agreement, a referral is made to the EMA. The CHMP will provide an opinion that will form the basis of a decision to be issued by the EC that is binding on all EEA countries. If the application is successful during the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure, national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the EEA countries chosen by the applicant.
In principle, a marketing authorization has an initial validity of five years. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EEA country in which the original marketing authorization was granted. To support the application, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the Electronic Common Technical Document, or eCTD, providing up to date data concerning the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least nine months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The EC or the competent authorities of the EEA countries may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year renewal period for the marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EEA country within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 

51



In the EU, conditional marketing authorizations may be granted in the centralized procedure for a limited number of medicinal products for human use in cases where the related clinical dataset is not yet complete. A conditional marketing authorization may be granted for a medicinal product, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive data after the authorization, (3) the medicinal product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. The authorization is valid for one year and must be renewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled. Once any pending studies are provided, the conditional marketing authorization can be converted into a traditional marketing authorization. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the marketing authorization will cease to be renewed.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the EU
In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The concept of global marketing authorization prevents the same marketing authorization holder or members of the same group, or companies that have concluded tacit or explicit agreements concerning the marketing of the same medicinal product, from obtaining separate data and market exclusivity periods for medicinal products that contain the same active substance. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Pediatric Development in the EU
In the EU, Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that all MAAs for new medicinal products must include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a PIP agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO may grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures provided in the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Furthermore, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all EU Member States and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-month extension to the Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC if any is in effect at the time of authorization or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of orphan market exclusivity.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity in the EU
Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that : (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (a) such conditions affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product; and (3) there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU, or even if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.

52



Orphan medicinal product designation entitles an applicant to incentives such fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized marketing authorization procedure. Upon grant of a marketing authorization, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means that the EMA cannot accept another marketing authorization application, or grant a marketing authorization, or accept an application to extend a marketing authorization for a similar product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan medicinal product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The period of market exclusivity may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria on the basis of which it received orphan medicinal product destination, including where it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10 year period if: (i) if the applicant consents to a second original orphan medicinal product application, (ii) if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities; or (iii) if the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the register of orphan products.
Post-Approval Requirements in the EU
Where a marketing authorization is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. 
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare 

53



payments to providers up to two percent (2%) per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the ACA. We expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products that we successfully commercialize or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. In addition to the ACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits.
Further, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry.
Human Capital 
We believe the success of the company depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. We seek to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits packages in our expanding organization, with opportunities for our employees to thrive, grow and develop in their careers. We hold our employees to high ethical performance standards and our compensation plans include, as applicable, equity and cash compensation components designed to enable us to offer competitive base pay and attractive incentive schemes.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 147 full time employees. Of these employees, 105 were employed in research and development roles, 26 were employed in commercial roles and 16 were employed within general and administration. Women represented approximately 60% of our workforce and men represented approximately 40%. Following the execution of our 2023 restructuring plan, we had 95 full time employees by the end of February 2023. 
The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We offer comprehensive benefits to protect the health of our employees and their families. 
The members of our management team are employed by both our company and Y-mAbs Therapeutics A/S, our wholly owned Danish subsidiary. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
