Item 1.  Business.
Overview
 We are an externally managed non‑diversified closed‑end management investment company that elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).  We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the JOBS Act, and, as such, are subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.  Our investment objective is to seek to generate both current income and capital appreciation, while seeking to protect against risk of capital loss, by investing predominantly in the debt instruments of middle-market companies in a range of industries, which our external investment manager, Great Elm Capital Management, Inc. (“GECM”), defines as companies with enterprise values between $100.0 million and $2.0 billion.  Our investment objectives may be changed without a vote of the holders of a majority of our stock.  GECM provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate.
 We made, and expect to make, multi‑year investments primarily in secured and senior unsecured debt instruments that we purchase in the secondary markets.  We may also originate investments directly with issuers.  We invest in companies that have high leverage or operate in industries experiencing cyclical declines.  Investments in these companies may trade at discounts to their original issue prices.  We seek to protect against risk of loss by investing in borrowers with tangible and intangible assets, where GECM believes asset values are expected to, or do, exceed our investment and any debt that is senior to, or ranks in parity with, our investment.  We seek investments whose total return potential (interest income plus capital appreciation and fees, if any) appropriately recognizes potential investment risks.  GECM’s investment process includes a focus on an investment’s contractual documents, as it seeks to identify rights that enhance an investment’s risk protection and avoid contracts that compromise potential returns or recoveries.  We may also invest in subordinated debt, mezzanine debt, and equity or equity‑linked financial instruments.

Investment Selection
 GECM employs a team of investment professionals with experience in leveraged finance.  The sector-focused research team performs fundamental research at both the industry and company level.  Through in-depth industry coverage, GECM's investment team seeks to develop a thorough understanding of the fundamental market, sector drivers, mergers and acquisition activity, security pricing and trading and new issue trends.  GECM's investment team believes that understanding industry trends is an important element of investment success.  
Idea Generation, Origination and Refinement
 Idea generation and origination is maximized through long‑standing and extensive relationships with industry contacts, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, as well as current and former clients, portfolio companies and investors.  GECM’s investment team is expected to supplement these lead sources by also utilizing broader research efforts, such as attendance at prospective borrower industry conferences and an active calling effort to brokers and investment bankers.  GECM’s investment team focuses their idea generation and origination efforts on middle‑market companies.  In screening potential investments, GECM’s investment team utilizes a value‑oriented investment philosophy with analysis and research focused on the preservation of capital.  GECM has identified several criteria that it believes are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies.  GECM’s process requires focus on the terms of the applicable contracts and instruments perfecting security interests.  GECM’s criteria provide general guidelines for GECM’s investment committee’s decisions; however, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which they choose to invest.
 Asset Based Investments.  Debt issued by firms with negative free cash flow but where GECM’s investment thesis is based on the value of the collateral or the issuer’s assets.  This type of investment focuses on expected realizable value of the issuer’s assets.
 Enterprise Value Investments.  Debt issued by firms whose business generates free cash flow to service the debt with a margin of safety and the enterprise value of the firm represents the opportunity for principal to be repaid by refinancing or in connection with a merger or acquisition transaction.  These investments focus on the going concern value of the enterprise.
 Other Debt Investments.  Debt issued by firms which have the ability to pay interest and principal out of expected free cash flow from their business.  These investments focus on the sustainability and defensibility of cash flows from the business.
Due Diligence
 GECM’s due diligence typically includes:
  
▪ | analysis of the credit documents by GECM’s investment team (including the members of the team with legal training and years of professional experience). GECM will engage outside counsel when necessary as well; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | review of historical and prospective financial information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | research relating to the prospective portfolio company’s management, industry, markets, customers, products and services and competitors and customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | verification of collateral;
--+----------------------------


▪ | interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the prospective portfolio company; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | informal or formal background and reference checks.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 Upon the completion of due diligence and a decision to proceed with an investment in a company, the investment professionals leading the diligence process present the opportunity to GECM’s investment committee, which then determines whether to pursue the potential investment.

Approval of Investment Transactions
 GECM’s procedures call for each new investment under consideration by the GECM analysts to be preliminarily reviewed at periodic meetings of GECM’s investment team.  GECM’s investment team then prepares a summary of the investment, including a financial model and risk cases and a legal review checklist.  GECM’s investment committee then will hold a formal review meeting, and following approval of a specific investment, authorization is given to GECM’s trader, including execution guidelines.
 GECM’s investment analysts provide regular updates of the positions for which they are responsible to members of GECM’s investment committee.
 GECM’s investment analysts and members of the GECM investment committee will jointly decide when to sell a position.  The sale decision will then be given to GECM’s trader, who will execute the trade in consultation with the analyst and the applicable member of GECM’s investment committee.
 Ongoing Relationship with Portfolio Companies
 As a BDC, we offer, and sometimes provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies.  This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of our portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance.
 GECM’s investment team monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.  They monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company and its respective industry to assess the appropriate course of action for each investment.  GECM’s ongoing monitoring of a portfolio company will include both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the company and its industry.
 Valuation Procedures
 We value our assets, an essential input in the determination of our net asset value consistent with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and as required by the Investment Company Act.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Critical Accounting Policies” for an extended discussion of our methodology.
Staffing
 We do not currently have any employees.  Mr. Reed is our Chief Executive Officer and President and GECM’s Chief Investment Officer.  Under an Administration Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2016 (the “Administration Agreement”), by and between us and GECM, GECM provides the services of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer.
Competition
 We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, hedge funds, mutual funds, mezzanine funds and small business investment companies), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks, direct lending funds and other sources of funding.  Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including making investments in the types of portfolio companies we target.  Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do.

Formation Transactions
 On June 23, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), with Full Circle Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Full Circle”), that provided for a stock-for-stock merger (the “Merger”) of Full Circle with and into GECC. Concurrent with delivery of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a Subscription Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Great Elm Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GEC”), and private investment funds (the “MAST Funds”) managed by MAST Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“MAST Capital”). Per the Subscription Agreement, GEC contributed $30.0 million to us. Prior to the Merger and our election to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act, per the Subscription Agreement, we acquired a portfolio of debt instruments (the “Initial GECC Portfolio”) from the MAST Funds. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement, the MAST Funds owned approximately 75% of the pre‑Merger outstanding shares of our common stock and GEC owned 25% of the pre‑Merger outstanding shares of our common stock. The Merger was completed on November 3, 2016.
 Exemptive Relief
 We intend to apply to the SEC for exemptive relief that will allow us to co‑invest, together with other investment vehicles managed by GECM, in specific investment opportunities.  We are unable to predict whether or not the SEC will grant the requested exemption.  If the SEC does not provide the requested exemption, GECM will allocate investment opportunities to different investment vehicles in accordance with its allocation policies.
Investment Management Agreement
 Management Services
 GECM serves as our investment adviser and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”).  Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors (our “Board”), GECM manages our day‑to‑day operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us.  Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2016 (the “Investment Management Agreement”), by and between us and GECM, GECM:

▪ | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of our investments (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | closes and monitors our investments; and
--+-----------------------------------------


▪ | determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 GECM’s services to us under the Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and GECM is free to furnish similar services to other entities.
 Management and Incentive Fees
 Under the Investment Management Agreement, GECM receives a fee from us, consisting of two components: (1) a base management fee and (2) an incentive fee.
 The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% based on the average value of our total assets (determined under GAAP) (other than cash or cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.  The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears.
 The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not.  One component of the inventive fee is based on income (the “Income Incentive Fee”) and the other component is based on capital gains (the “Capital Gains Incentive Fee”).

Income Incentive Fee
 The Income Incentive Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre‑incentive fee net investment income for the quarter.  Pre‑incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee).  Pre‑incentive fee net investment income includes any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment‑in‑kind (“PIK”) interest, PIK dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that we and our consolidated subsidiaries have recognized in accordance with GAAP, but have not yet received in cash (collectively, “Accrued Unpaid Income”).
 Pre‑incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.  Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss.  For example, if we receive pre‑incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses.
 Pre‑incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined in accordance with GAAP) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized).  If market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre‑incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for GECM to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income.
 We pay the incentive fee with respect to our pre‑incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
  
▪ | no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre‑incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | 100% of our pre‑incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre‑incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate, but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre‑incentive fee net investment income as the “catch up” provision. The “catch up” is meant to provide GECM with 20% of the pre‑incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if our net investment income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | 20% of the amount of our pre‑incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income related portion of the incentive fee:

These calculations are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter and will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months.  Any Income Incentive Fee otherwise payable with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income (collectively, the “Accrued Unpaid Income Incentive Fees”) will be deferred, on a security by security basis, and will become payable only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received by us or our consolidated subsidiaries in respect thereof.  Any Accrued Unpaid Income that is subsequently reversed in connection with a write‑down, write‑off, impairment or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to such Accrued Unpaid Income will, in the applicable period of reversal, (1) reduce pre‑incentive fee net investment income and (2) reduce the amount of Accrued Unpaid Income deferred pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement.  Subsequent payments of Income Incentive Fees deferred pursuant to this paragraph do not reduce the amounts payable for any quarter pursuant to the other terms of the Investment Management Agreement.
 We will defer cash payment of any Income Incentive Fee otherwise payable to the investment adviser in any quarter (excluding Accrued Unpaid Income Incentive Fees with respect to such quarter) that exceeds (1) 20% of the Cumulative Pre‑Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the most recent twelve full calendar quarter period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made (the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”) less (2) the aggregate incentive fees that were previously paid to the investment adviser during such Trailing Twelve Quarters (excluding Accrued Unpaid Income Incentive Fees during such Trailing Twelve Quarters and not subsequently paid).  “Cumulative Pre‑Incentive Fee Net Return” during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters means the sum of (a) pre‑incentive fee net investment income in respect of such Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) net realized capital losses and net unrealized capital depreciation, if any, in each case calculated in accordance with GAAP, in respect of such Trailing Twelve Quarters.
 Capital Gains Incentive Fee
 The Capital Gains Incentive Fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing with the partial calendar year ended December 31, 2016, and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (a) the sum of our and our consolidated subsidiaries’ cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (b) our and our consolidated subsidiaries’ cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from November 4, 2016.  If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the Capital Gains Incentive Fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Capital Gains Incentive Fees paid in all prior years.  If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Incentive Fee for such year.
 The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.  The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.  The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the fair value of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Incentive Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculations
 The following hypothetical calculations illustrate the calculation of net investment income based incentive fees under the Investment Management Agreement.  Amounts shown are a percentage of total net assets.

 | Assumption 1 | | Assumption 2 | | Assumption 3
-------------------------------------------+--------------+------+--------------+-----+-------------
Investment income(1) | | 3.46 | % | | | 4.61 | % | | 5.46 | % | 
Hurdle rate (7% annualized) | | 1.75 | % | | | 1.75 | % | | 1.75 | % | 
"Catch up" provision (8.75% annualized) | | 2.19 | % | | | 2.19 | % | | 2.19 | % | 
Pre-incentive fee net investment income(2) | | 1.00 | % | | | 2.15 | % | | 3.00 | % | 
Incentive fee | | - | % | (3) | | 0.40 | % | (4) | 0.60 | % | (5)


(1) | Investment income includes interest income, dividends and other fee income.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Pre-incentive fee net investment income is net of management fees and other expenses and excludes organizational and offering expenses. In these examples, management fees are 0.38% (1.50% annualized) of net assets and other expenses are assumed to be 2.08% of net assets. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The pre-incentive fee net investment income is below the hurdle rate and thus no incentive fee is earned.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | The pre-incentive fee net investment income ratio of 2.15% is between the hurdle rate and the top of the “catch up” provision thus the corresponding incentive fee is calculated as 100% × (2.15% - 1.75%). 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | The pre-incentive fee net investment income ratio of 3.00% is greater than both the hurdle rate and the “catch up” provision thus the corresponding incentive fee is calculated as (i) 100% × (2.1875% – 1.75%) or 0.4375% (the “catch up”); plus (ii) 20% × (3.00% - 2.1875%).

 As illustrated in Year 3 of Assumption 1 above, if GECC were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year, we may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if GECC had been wound up on December 31 of such year.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $3.0 million in base management fees and $0.2 million in income based fees accrued during the period.  The incentive fees are currently expected to be deferred in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement.  There were no capital gains incentive fees earned by GECM as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $2.3 million in base management fees and $4.4 million in income-based fees accrued during the period.  The incentive fees were deferred in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement.  There were no capital gains incentive fees earned by GECM as calculated under the Investment Management Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 For the period ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $0.4 million in base management fees and $0.9 million in income based fees accrued during the period. The incentive fees were deferred in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement.

Duration and Termination
 Our Board approved the Investment Management Agreement on August 8, 2016.  The Investment Management Agreement renews for successive annual periods subject to annual approval by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons.” The Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate if it is assigned.  The Investment Management Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other.  The Investment Management Agreement is currently in effect.
 12


Conflicts of interest may arise if GECM seeks to change the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, including, for example, the terms for compensation.  Any material change to the Investment Management Agreement must be submitted to stockholders for approval under the Investment Company Act and we may from time to time decide it is appropriate to seek stockholder approval to change the terms of the Investment Management Agreement.
 Indemnification
 We agreed to indemnify GECM, its stockholders and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person affiliated with it, to the fullest extent permitted by law, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GECM’s services under the Investment Management Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
 Organization of the Investment Adviser
 GECM is a Delaware corporation and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.  GECM’s principal executive offices are located at 800 South Street, Suite 230, Waltham, MA 02453.
 Regulation as a Business Development Company
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the Investment Company Act.  A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the lesser of:

▪ | 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act.  Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC.  Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person's office.
 We are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 150%.  We may also be prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 We are generally unable to sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share.  As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.  We may, however, sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share:
  
▪ | in connection with a rights offering to our existing stockholders,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | with the consent of the majority of our common stockholders, or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 For example, we may sell shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our and our stockholders’ best interests, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales.  In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which shares of our common stock are sold may be the fair value of such shares of common stock.  We may be examined by the SEC for compliance with the Investment Company Act.
 13


We may not acquire any asset other than "qualifying assets" unless, at the time we make such acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represents at least 70% of the value of our total assets.  The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are:
  
▪ | securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by a BDC) and that:
  
▪ | does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its board of directors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250.0 million; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 Control, as defined by the Investment Company Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company.
 In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC.
 To include certain securities described above as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a BDC must offer to the issuer of those securities managerial assistance such as providing guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.  We offer to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.
 Pending investment in other types of "qualifying assets," as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which are referred to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets, as applicable, are qualifying assets.  We will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies.  A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate.  There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements.  However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes.  Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit.
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock, if our asset coverage, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance.  In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of our common stock unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase.  We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.

Code of Ethics
 We and GECM have each adopted a code of ethics, which applies to the management at each company, respectively, pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our or GECM's personnel, respectively.  Each code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.  You may also obtain copies of the codes of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Material Federal Income Tax Matters
 We currently qualify as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest (including tax‑exempt interest), payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income (including but not limited to gain from options, futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (a “QPTP”); and (b) diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year (i) at least 50% of the market value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer (subject to the exception described below), and (ii) not more than 25% of the market value of our total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other regulated investment companies) (A) of any issuer, (B) of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or (C) of one or more QPTPs.  We may generate certain income that might not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% annual gross income requirement described above.  We will monitor our transactions to endeavor to prevent our disqualification as a RIC.
 If we fail to satisfy the 90% annual gross income requirement or the asset diversification requirements discussed above in any taxable year, we may be eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements.  Additionally, relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the asset diversification requirements where we correct the failure within a specified period.  If the applicable relief provisions are not available or cannot be met, all of our income would be subject to corporate‑level U.S. federal income tax as described below.  We cannot provide assurance that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90% annual gross income requirement or the asset diversification requirements discussed above.
 As a RIC, in any taxable year with respect to which we timely distribute at least 90% of the sum of:
  
▪ | our investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net short‑term capital gain over net long‑term capital loss and other taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | net tax exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gain (generally, net long‑term capital gain in excess of short‑term capital loss) that we distribute to our stockholders.  We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income on a timely basis.
 To the extent that we retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate income tax rates.  We may choose to retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax, including the federal excise tax described below.
 15


Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax payable by us.  To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be deemed to have distributed) during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of:
  
▪ | at least 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | at least 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one‑year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4% federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax.  In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
 If, in any particular taxable year, we do not satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise were to fail to qualify as a RIC (for example, because we fail the 90% annual gross income requirement described above), and relief is not available as discussed above, all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to stockholders, and distributions generally will be taxable to the stockholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
 We may decide to be taxed as a regular corporation even if we would otherwise qualify as a RIC if we determine that treatment as a corporation for a particular year would be in our best interests.
 If we realize a net capital loss, the excess of our net short‑term capital loss over our net long‑term capital gain is treated as a short‑term capital loss arising on the first day of our next taxable year and the excess of our net long‑term capital loss over our net short‑term capital gain is treated as a long‑term capital loss arising on the first day of our next taxable year.  If future capital gain is offset by carried forward capital losses, such future capital gain is not subject to fund‑level U.S. federal income tax, regardless of whether they are distributed to stockholders.  Accordingly, we do not expect to distribute any such offsetting capital gain.  A RIC cannot carry back or carry forward any net operating losses.
 Our Investments
 Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things:
  
▪ | disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | convert lower taxed long‑term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed, short‑term capital gain or ordinary income;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | produce income that will not qualify as “good income” for purposes of the 90% annual gross income requirement described above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities (even if it is not advantageous to dispose of such securities) to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of us as a RIC.
 16


Investments we make in securities issued at a discount or providing for deferred interest or PIK interest are subject to special tax rules that will affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders.  For example, with respect to securities issued at a discount, we will generally be required to accrue daily as income a portion of the discount and to distribute such income on a timely basis each year to maintain our qualification as a RIC and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes.  Since in certain circumstances we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty making distributions in the amounts necessary to satisfy the requirements for maintaining RIC status and for avoiding U.S. federal income and excise taxes.  Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements.  If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate‑level income tax.
 Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work‑out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company.  Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non‑cash income.  Any such restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non‑qualifying income for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement or our receiving assets that would not count toward the asset diversification requirements.
 Gain or loss recognized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss.  Such gain or loss generally will be long‑term or short‑term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
 If we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities.  Stockholders will generally not be entitled to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to foreign taxes paid by us.
 If we acquire shares in a “passive foreign investment company” (a “PFIC”), we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders.  Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.  If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code (a “QEF”), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to us.  Alternatively, we can elect to mark‑to‑market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income.  Our ability to make either election will depend on factors beyond our control.  Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax.
 If we hold more than 10% of the shares in, or the value of, a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”), we may be required to include in our gross income our pro rata share of such CFC’s “subpart F income” and “global intangible low-taxed income,” whether or not the corporation makes an actual distribution during such year.  In general, a foreign corporation will be classified as a CFC if more than 50% of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, is owned (directly, indirectly or by attribution) by U.S. Stockholders.  A U.S. Stockholder, for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses (actually or constructively) 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of shares or 10% or more of the value of a corporation.  If we are treated as receiving a deemed distribution from a CFC, we will be required to include such distribution in our investment company taxable income regardless of whether we receives any actual distributions from such CFC, and we must distribute such income to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 17


Although the Code generally provides that income inclusions from QEFs and deemed distributions of subpart F income and global intangible low-taxed income from CFCs will be “good income” for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement to the extent such income is distributed to a RIC in the year it is included in the RIC’s income, the Code does not specifically provide whether income inclusions from a QEF or deemed distributions from a CFC during the RIC’s taxable year with respect to which no distribution is received would be “good income” for the 90% gross income requirement.  The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has issued a series of private rulings in which it has concluded that all income inclusions from a QEF and deemed dividends from a CFC included in a RIC’s income would constitute “good income” for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement.  The Department of the Treasury, however, has proposed regulations that would treat such income as not being “good income” for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement.  If such regulations are finalized, and if we realize a material amount of such income and it is not considered “good income” for purposes of the 90% gross income requirement, we may fail to qualify as a RIC.
 Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Under Section 988 of the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss.  Similarly, gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss.
 If we borrow money, we may be prevented by loan covenants from declaring and paying dividends in certain circumstances.  Limits on our payment of dividends may prevent us from meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement, and may, therefore, jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a RIC, or subject us to the 4% excise tax.
 Even if we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements, under the Investment Company Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met.  This may also jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a RIC or subject us to the 4% excise tax.
 Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the asset diversification requirements.  If we dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the asset diversification requirements, or the 4% excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 Some of the income that we might otherwise earn, such as lease income, management fees, or income recognized in a work‑out or restructuring of a portfolio investment, may not satisfy the 90% gross income requirement.  To manage the risk that such income might disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% gross income requirement, one or more of our subsidiaries treated as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be employed to earn such income.  Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce the yield to our stockholders on such income and fees.
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and relief is not available as discussed above, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates.  We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders nor would we be required to make distributions for tax purposes.  Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for reduced maximum rates for non-corporate stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate U.S. stockholders would be eligible for the dividends received deduction.  Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.  If we were to fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then to seek to requalify as a RIC, we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation in our assets unless we made a special election to pay corporate level tax on any such unrealized appreciation recognized during the succeeding five‑year period.

Administration Agreement
 Our Board approved the Administration Agreement on August 8, 2016.  Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, GECM furnishes us with, or otherwise arranges for the provision of, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and other such services as the administrator.  Under the Administration Agreement, GECM will, from time to time, provide, or otherwise arrange for the provision of, other services GECM determines to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including retaining the services of financial, compliance, accounting and administrative personnel that perform services on our behalf, including personnel to serve as our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer.  Under the Administration Agreement, GECM also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC.  In addition, GECM assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others.  Payments made by us to GECM under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of GECM’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs).  The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
 We bear all costs and expenses that are incurred in our operation and transactions and not specifically assumed by GECM pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement.
 The Administration Agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, GECM, its stockholders and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from or otherwise based upon the rendering of GECM’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator.
 Great Elm License Agreement
 We entered into a license agreement with GEC pursuant to which GEC granted us a non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to use the name “Great Elm Capital Corp.” Under the license agreement, we have a right to use the Great Elm Capital Corp. name and the logo for so long as GECM, or an affiliate thereof, remains our investment adviser.  Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Great Elm Capital Corp.” name.

 GECM does not expect to execute our transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but it plans to seek to obtain the best net results for us, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution and operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities.  While GECM will generally seek reasonably competitive trade execution costs, we will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available.  Subject to applicable legal requirements, GECM may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to GECM, us or GECM’s other clients.  In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if we or GECM determines in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.
