Our Business
 Frontier Oilfield Services, Inc. a Texas corporation (and collectively with its subsidiaries, “we”, “our”, “Frontier”, “FOSI”, or the “Company”), was organized on March 24, 1995. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company as well as:

● | Frontier Acquisition I, Inc., and its direct and indirect subsidiaries Chico Coffman Tank Trucks, Inc. (“CTT”) and Coffman Disposal, LLC; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Frontier Income and Growth, LLC (FIG) and its subsidiaries Trinity Disposal & Trucking, LLC and Trinity Disposal Wells, LLC. 

 
Frontier operates in the oilfield service industry and is currently involved in the disposal of saltwater and other oilfield fluids in Texas. Frontier owns eight disposal wells in Texas. Six of these disposal wells are located in the Barnett Shale region in north central Texas and two of these wells are located in east Texas near the Louisiana border.
 
The Barnett Shale region is a productive shale formation with a concentration of successful oil and gas wells. These wells have been completed using hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling techniques. In east Texas, the producing oil and gas wells have typically been in place for many decades. Production stimulation techniques such as salt-water flood projects are used whereby salt water is injected into a producing formation to accelerate the migration of hydrocarbons to the well bore. The oil and gas wells in the Barnett Shale and in east Texas produce commercially viable volumes of hydrocarbons in the form of crude oil and natural gas. In addition, these wells produce significant volumes of salt water and other fluids as a by-product of the production of hydrocarbons. The salt water and fluids must be routinely removed from the well site on a daily, semiweekly or weekly basis depending on the flow rate of the wells.

The significant quantity of wells in the Barnett Shale and east Texas regions combined with the presence of salt water and other fluids in the production process creates demand for disposal services such as those services provided by Frontier.
 
We had one customer that represented approximately 32% of our revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Recent Developments
 None.
 
Development and Operating Activities
 Economic conditions in the oil and gas industry are subject to volatility. The uncertain nature of these economic conditions combined with federal and state regulatory uncertainty in the energy industry requires operators to be flexible and adept at adjusting operations and strategy to achieve profitability. We intend to evaluate all conditions and risks affecting our operating activities and to respond to those conditions by employing resources in areas we believe to have the most potential for success. Over the past year, significant declines in the price of crude oil and natural gas have put economic pressure on oil producers, requiring them to seek expense reductions to offset the decline in their revenues. The oil field service industry has been and will continue to be affected by the volatility in oil and natural gas prices and may experience lower revenues as oil producers’ pressure oil field service providers for lower cost service.
 
The Company’s business requires capital to fund operations and growth. Management intends to conduct operations to generate sufficient capital for use in reduction of the Company’s outstanding debt. In order to adequately fund operating activities, reduce current liabilities, and pay interest and principal on the debt, we may need to secure additional capital from third parties or other debt or equity financing sources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into additional financing arrangements on terms that are acceptable. There are also no assurances that we will be able to achieve profitability from our operations in the current market environment.
 
General Regulations
 Both state and federal authorities regulate the transportation and disposal of salt water, produced fluids and drilling fluids. The executive and legislative branches of government at both the state and federal levels have periodically proposed the establishment of controls on salt water disposal, environmental protection, as well as various other related programs affecting the salt water disposal business. If any further legislation is promulgated related to the disposal of salt water, produced fluids or drilling fluids, such legislation could have a material effect on our operations.
Federal Regulatory Actions
 Federal legislation has also been introduced which may have an effect on the use of hydraulic fracturing to increase oil and gas production, primarily in shale formations, due to concerns related to potential contamination of drinking water supplies.
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel. In addition, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation generally of hydraulic fracturing in the United States under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process.
 
The Company’s operations are located in areas where hydraulic fracturing is used as the primary method of establishing and developing oil and gas producing wells. These areas are also where the majority of the Company’s revenues are generated as these producing wells also generate salt water and other fluids as by-products of the oil and gas producing process. Any regulation inhibiting or prohibiting the use of hydraulic fracturing may have a material adverse effect on our operations.

State Regulatory Controls
 The State of Texas (where we operate) regulates the operation and permitting associated with the transport and disposal of salt water and other produced fluids. Because we are primarily engaged in salt water, produced fluids and drilling fluid disposal activities, our operations are subject to inspection and permitting by authorities of the State of Texas. There have been recent regulatory and legislative proposals related to concerns with potential water supply contamination potentially be caused by hydraulic fracturing operations.
Environmental Regulations
 Our salt water and other fluids disposal operations are subject to environmental protection regulations established by federal, state, and local agencies. We believe we are in compliance with the applicable environmental regulations established by these agencies with jurisdiction over our operations. Certain environmental regulations currently in effect could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or prospects for profitability if we received a determination from one of these agencies that our operations are not in compliance. The Texas Legislature has mandated a regulatory program for the management of hazardous wastes generated during crude oil and natural gas exploration and production, gas processing, oil and gas waste reclamation, salt water disposal and transportation operations. The disposal of these wastes, as governed by the Railroad Commission of Texas, is subject to the supervision of state of Texas authorities. Our disposal operations are also subject to inspection and regulation by state and federal environmental authorities.
Employees
 Currently, we have nine full-time employees, with two full-time employees at our corporate office and seven full-time employees in operations.
