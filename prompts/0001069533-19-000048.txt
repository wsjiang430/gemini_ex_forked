Item 1. | Business.

General and Historical Development
Resources was incorporated in the state of Virginia on July 31, 1998, for the primary purpose of becoming the holding company for Roanoke Gas and its subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 1999, Roanoke Gas and its subsidiaries were reorganized into the holding company structure. Resources is currently composed of the following subsidiaries: Roanoke Gas, Diversified Energy and Midstream.
Roanoke Gas, originally established in 1883, was organized as a public service corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1912. The principal service of Roanoke Gas is the distribution and sale of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers within its service territory in Roanoke, Virginia and the surrounding localities. Roanoke Gas also provides certain non-regulated services which account for less than 2% of consolidated revenues.
In July 2015, the Company formed Midstream for the purpose of becoming a 1% investor in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. The LLC was created to construct and operate interstate natural gas pipelines. Additional information regarding this investment is provided under Note 5 of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and under the Equity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline section of Item 7. 
Diversified Energy currently has no active operations.
Services
Roanoke Gas maintains an integrated natural gas distribution system to deliver natural gas purchased from suppliers to residential, commercial and industrial users in its service territory. The schedule below is a summary of customers, delivered volumes (expressed in DTH), revenues and margin as a percentage of the total for each category. For the purposes of this schedule, margin for the utility operations is defined as revenues less cost of gas.

Roanoke Gas’ regulated natural gas distribution business accounted for approximately 98% of Resources total revenues for fiscal years ending September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The tables above indicate that residential customers represent over 91% of the Company’s customer total; however, they represent less than 40% of the total gas volumes delivered and more than half of the Company’s consolidated revenues and margin. Industrial customers include primarily transportation customers that purchase their natural gas requirements directly from a supplier other than the Company and utilize Roanoke Gas’ natural gas distribution system for delivery to their operations. Most of the revenue billed for these customers relates only to transportation service, and not to the purchase of natural gas, causing total revenues generated by these deliveries to be approximately 7% of total revenues, even though they represent 30% of total natural gas deliveries for the year ended September 30, 2019 and approximately 10% to 11% of margin for each of the years presented.
The Company’s revenues are affected by changes in gas costs as well as by changes in consumption volume due to weather and economic conditions and changes in the non-gas portion of customer billing rates. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas are passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism as explained in Note 1 of the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s residential and commercial sales are seasonal and temperature-sensitive as the majority of the gas sold by Roanoke Gas to these customers is used for heating. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, approximately 67% of the Company’s total DTH of natural gas deliveries and 76% of the residential and commercial deliveries were made in the five-month period of November through March. Total natural gas deliveries were approximately 9.9 million DTH in fiscal 2019 and 2018 and 8.6 million DTH in fiscal 2017.
Suppliers
Roanoke Gas relies on multiple interstate pipelines including those operated by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, LLC and Columbia Gulf Transmission Corporation, LLC (together “Columbia”), and East Tennessee Natural Gas, LLC (“East Tennessee”), Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Saltville Gas Storage Company, LLC ("Saltville") to transport natural gas from the production and storage fields to Roanoke Gas’ distribution system. Roanoke Gas is directly served by two pipelines, Columbia and East Tennessee. Columbia historically has delivered more than 60% of the Company’s gas supply, while East Tennessee delivers the balance of the Company’s requirements. The rates paid for natural gas transportation and storage services purchased from the interstate pipeline companies are established by tariffs approved by FERC. These tariffs contain flexible pricing provisions, which, in some instances, authorize these transporters to reduce rates and charges to meet price competition. The current pipeline contracts expire at various times from 2022 to 2027. The Company anticipates being able to renew these contracts or enter into other contracts to meet customers’ continued demand for natural gas.
The Company manages its pipeline contracts and LNG facility in order to provide for sufficient capacity to meet the natural gas demands of its customers. The maximum daily winter capacity available for delivery into Roanoke Gas’ distribution system under the interstate pipelines is 78,606 DTH per day. The LNG facility is capable of storing up to 200,000 DTH of natural gas in a liquid state for use during peak demand. Combined, the pipelines and LNG facility may provide up to 103,606 DTH on a single winter day. 
The Company uses multi-year contracts to meet its natural gas supply needs. The Company currently contracts with Sequent Energy Management, L.P. to manage its pipeline transportation, storage rights, gas supply inventories and deliveries and serve as the primary supplier of natural gas for Roanoke Gas. Natural gas purchased under the asset management agreement is priced at indexed-based market prices as reported in major industry pricing publications. The Company renewed its contract with the asset manager in March 2018. The new agreement expires March 31, 2021.

The Company uses summer storage programs to supplement gas supply requirements during the winter months. During the summer months, the Company injects gas into its LNG facility. In addition, the Company has contracted for storage capacity from Columbia, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Saltville for a combined total of more than 2.4 million DTH of storage capacity. The balance of the Company’s annual natural gas requirements are met primarily through market purchases made by its asset manager.
Competition
The Company’s natural gas utility operates in a regulated, monopolistic environment. Roanoke Gas currently holds the only franchises and/or CPCNs to distribute natural gas in its Virginia service areas. These franchises generally extend for multi-year periods and are renewable by the municipalities, including exclusive franchises in the cities of Roanoke and Salem and the Town of Vinton, Virginia. All three franchise agreements were recently renewed for a term of 20 years and will expire December 31, 2035. In 2019, the SCC issued a final order granting a CPCN to furnish gas to all of Franklin County. Unlike the CPCNs for the other counties served by Roanoke Gas, the Franklin County CPCN will be terminated within five years of the date of the order if Roanoke Gas does not furnish gas service to the designated service area. Roanoke Gas plans to serve the Franklin County area with natural gas delivered through the MVP once that pipeline goes in service.
Management anticipates that the Company will be able to renew all of its franchises when they expire. There can be no assurance, however, that a given jurisdiction will not refuse to renew a franchise or will not, in connection with the renewal of a franchise, attempt to impose restrictions or conditions that could adversely affect the Company’s business operations or financial condition. CPCNs, issued by the SCC, are generally of perpetual duration and subject to compliance with regulatory standards.
Although Roanoke Gas has exclusive rights for the distribution of natural gas in its service area, the Company competes with suppliers of other forms of energy such as fuel oil, electricity, propane, coal, wind and solar. Competition can be intense among the other energy sources with price being the primary driver in most instances. This is particularly true for those industrial applications that have the ability to switch to alternative fuels. The relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of natural gas. Greater demand for natural gas for electric generation and other uses can provide upward pressure on the price of natural gas. Currently, a plentiful supply of natural gas, mostly due to improved drilling and extraction processes in shale formations, has served to maintain prices at lower levels. 
Competition from renewable "clean" energy sources like solar and wind may increase as the political environment may favor these energy sources through incentives or by placing restrictions on emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the Company continues to see a demand for its product. Construction activity for new business and growth in residential service has remained steady as the Company continues to grow its customer base through a combination of extending service by new construction and converting existing alternative energy source users to natural gas. 
Regulation
In addition to the regulatory requirements generally applicable to all companies, Roanoke Gas is also subject to additional regulation at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the Company is subject to pipeline safety regulations issued by the Department of Transportation and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
At the state level, the SCC performs regulatory oversight including the approval of rates and other charges for natural gas sold to customers, the approval of agreements between or among affiliated companies involving the provision of goods and services, pipeline safety, and certain other corporate activities of the Company, including mergers and acquisitions related to utility operations.
At the local level, Roanoke Gas is further regulated by the municipalities and localities that grant franchises for the placement of gas distribution pipelines and the operation of gas distribution networks within their jurisdictions.
Employees
At September 30, 2019, Resources had 106 full-time employees and 107 total employees. As of that date, 26 employees, or 24%, belonged to the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied-Industrial International Union, Local No. 515 and were represented under a collective bargaining agreement. The union has been
