ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

THE COMPANY
Overview 
PNMR is an investor-owned holding company with two regulated utilities providing electricity and electric services in New Mexico and Texas. PNMR’s electric utilities are PNM and TNMP. PNMR is focused on achieving the following strategic goals:

• | Earning authorized returns on its regulated businesses


• | Delivering at or above industry-average earnings and dividend growth


• | Maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings

In conjunction with these goals, PNM and TNMP are dedicated to:

• | Maintaining strong employee safety, plant performance, and system reliability


• | Delivering a superior customer experience


• | Demonstrating environmental stewardship in business operations, including reducing CO2 emissions


• | Supporting the communities in their service territories

PNMR’s success in accomplishing these strategic goals is highly dependent on fair and timely regulatory treatment for its regulated utilities. Both PNM and TNMP seek cost recovery for their investments through general rate cases and various rate riders. PNM filed general rate cases with the NMPRC in August 2015 and December 2016. The NMPRC issued rate orders in those cases in September 2016 and January 2018. TNMP filed a general rate case in May 2018 and the PUCT issued an order in that case in December 2018. Additional information about rate filings is provided in Operations and Regulation below and in Note 17.

OPERATIONS AND REGULATION
Regulated Operations
PNM 
PNM is an electric utility that provides electric generation, transmission, and distribution service to its rate-regulated customers. PNM was incorporated in the State of New Mexico in 1917. PNM’s retail electric service territory covers a large area of north-central New Mexico, including the cities of Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe, and certain areas of southern New Mexico. Service to retail electric customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the NMPRC. The largest retail electric customer served by PNM accounted for 2.3% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Other services provided by PNM include wholesale transmission services to third parties as well as the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market, which services are regulated by FERC. PNM owns transmission lines that are interconnected with other utilities in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. Regulation encompasses the utility’s electric rates, service, accounting, issuances of securities, construction of major new generation, abandonment of existing generation, types of generation resources, transmission and distribution facilities, and other matters. See Note 17 for additional information on rate cases and other regulatory matters. 
NMPRC Regulated Retail Rate Proceedings
Customer rates for retail electric service are set by the NMPRC. On October 1, 2016, PNM implemented a NMPRC order in PNM’s NM 2015 Rate Case that approved an increase in non-fuel base rates of $61.2 million annually. PNM is appealing certain aspects of the NMPRC’s order in the NM Supreme Court. Other parties in that rate case have filed cross-appeals contesting other aspects of the NMPRC ruling. Oral argument at the NM Supreme Court was held on October 30, 2017. Although appeals of regulatory actions of the NMPRC have priority at the NM Supreme Court, there is no required time frame for the court to act on the appeal. See Note 17.
In December 2016, PNM filed the NM 2016 Rate Case with the NMPRC. The NM 2016 Rate Case proposed a non-fuel revenue increase of $99.2 million above October 1, 2016 base rates to be effective on January 1, 2018. The requested increase was based on a calendar 2018 FTY and a ROE of 10.125% compared to a ROE of 9.575% authorized in the NM 2015 Rate Case. The drivers of PNM’s identified revenue deficiency included the implementation of the plan for SJGS to comply with the CAA as discussed in Note 16, including the shutdown of SJGS Units 2 and 3, recovery of 50% of the net book value of those units, and the inclusion of PVNGS Unit 3 in retail rates as replacement power. In May 2017, PNM and several intervenors filed a stipulation that reduced the requested non-fuel revenue increase to $62.3 million and proposed an initial increase of $32.3 million beginning January 1, 2018 and the remaining increase beginning January 1, 2019. Among other things, the stipulation reduced the ROE to 9.575% and sought a debt-only return on PNM’s investment in SCRs at Four Corners. In October 2017, the Hearing Examiners to the NM 2016 Rate Case recommended approval of the agreed upon stipulation with certain modifications, including identifying PNM’s continuation in Four Corners as imprudent and recommending against PNM’s ability to collect a debt or equity return on certain investments in that facility. On January 17, 2018, the NMPRC issued a final order partially adopting the Hearing Examiners’ 
A - 2

recommendation resulting in an approved annual non-fuel revenue increase of $10.3 million. The NMPRC’s final order in the NM 2016 Rate case includes modifications to reflect a reduction of approximately $47.6 million in customer rates for the impact of federal tax reform beginning in 2018, rather than in 2019 as proposed, provides for a debt-only return on $148.1 million of PNM’s investments in Four Corners, and defers further consideration regarding PNM’s prudence related to Four Corners to PNM’s next general rate case. In accordance with the NMPRC’s final order, PNM implemented 50% of the approved rate increase for service rendered (rather than for bills rendered as PNM had requested) on February 1, 2018 and the rest of the increase for service rendered on January 1, 2019.
In February 2018, NEE filed a notice of appeal with the NM Supreme Court asking the court to review the NMPRC’s decisions in the NM 2016 Rate Case. Several parties to the case intervened in the appeal as intervenor-appellees in support of the NMPRC’s final decisions in the NM 2016 Rate Case. On November 15, 2018, NEE filed an unopposed motion to withdraw its appeal. On December 3, 2018, the NM Supreme Court issued an order of dismissal and remanded the matter to the NMPRC.
PNM has a NMPRC-approved rate rider to collect costs for renewable energy procurements that are not otherwise being collected in rates. If PNM’s earned return on jurisdictional equity in a calendar year, adjusted for weather and other items not representative of normal operation, exceeds the NMPRC-approved rate by 0.5%, the rider provides that PNM would refund the excess to customers during the following year. Through 2018, PNM’s earned return on jurisdictional equity has not exceeded the limitation. The NMPRC has also approved riders designed to allow PNM to bill and collect substantially all of fuel and purchased power costs and costs of approved energy efficiency initiatives.
FERC Regulated Wholesale Operations
Rates charged to wholesale electric transmission customers are based on a formula rate mechanism pursuant to which rates for wholesale transmission service are calculated annually in accordance with an approved formula. The formula includes updating cost of service components, including investment in plant and operating expenses, based on information contained in PNM’s annual financial report filed with FERC, as well as including projected large transmission capital projects to be placed into service in the following year. The projections included are subject to true-up in the formula rate for the following year. Certain items, including changes to return on equity and depreciation rates, require a separate filing to be made with FERC before being included in the formula rate. 
The low natural gas price environment resulted in market prices for power being substantially lower than what PNM is able to offer wholesale generation customers under the cost of service model that FERC requires PNM to use.  Consequently, PNM decided to stop pursuing wholesale generation contracts and currently has no full-requirements wholesale generation customers.
Operational Information
Weather-normalized retail electric KWh sales increased by 0.6% in 2018 and decreased by 0.9% in 2017. The system peak demands for retail and firm-requirements customers were as follows:
System Peak Demands

 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
 | (Megawatts)
Summer | 1,885 | | 1,843 | | 1,908
Winter | 1,351 | | 1,289 | | 1,376

PNM holds long-term, non-exclusive franchise agreements for its electric retail operations, with varying expiration dates. These franchise agreements allow the utility to access public rights-of-way for placement of its electric facilities. Franchise agreements have expired in some areas PNM serves, including Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe. Because PNM remains obligated under New Mexico state law to provide service to customers in these areas, the expirations should not have a material adverse impact. The Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe metropolitan areas accounted for 41.9%, 7.5%, and 6.7% of PNM’s 2018 revenues and no other franchise area represents more than 5%. PNM also earns revenues from its electric retail operations in its service areas that do not require franchise agreements.
As discussed in Note 16, PNM and other utilities are challenging the legal validity of an ordinance passed by the County Commission of Bernalillo County, New Mexico that would require utilities pay a yet-to-be-determined fee for operating facilities on county rights-of-way. If the challenge to the ordinance is unsuccessful, PNM believes any fees paid pursuant to the ordinance 
A - 3

would be considered franchise fees and would be recoverable from customers. PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
PNM owns 3,206 miles of electric transmission lines that interconnect with other utilities in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, and Utah. PNM owns transmission capacity in an area of eastern New Mexico with large wind generation potential and in recent years there has been substantial interest by developers of wind generation to interconnect to PNM’s transmission system in this area. PNM plans to construct approximately $130 million of new transmission facilities by 2020 to provide additional transmission service to deliver power from these generation resources to customers in New Mexico and California.
PNM also generates and sells electricity into the wholesale market. Through December 31, 2017, PNM’s 134 MW share of Unit 3 at PVNGS was excluded from retail rates and was being sold in the wholesale market. Effective January 1, 2018, the NMPRC authorized PNM to include PVNGS Unit 3 as a jurisdictional resource to serve New Mexico retail customers and to acquire 65 MW of SJGS Unit 4 as merchant plant. See Note 16 and Note 17. Shareholders realize any earnings or losses from generating resources that are not included in retail rates. PNM also engages in activities to optimize its existing jurisdictional assets and long-term power agreements through spot market, hour-ahead, day-ahead, week-ahead, and other sales of excess generation not required to fulfill retail load and contractual commitments. Through PNM’s FPPAC, 90% of the margins from these optimization sales were credited to retail customers through December 31, 2016, after which date 100% of the margins are credited to customers. 
Use of Future Test Year (“FTY”)
Under New Mexico law, the NMPRC must set rates using the test period, including a FTY that best reflects the conditions the utility will experience when new rates are anticipated to go into effect. The NMPRC also must include certain construction work in progress for environmental improvement, generation, and transmission projects in rate base. These provisions are designed to promote more timely recovery of reasonable costs of providing utility service. 
The use of a FTY should help PNM mitigate the adverse effects of regulatory lag, which is inherent when using a historical test year. Accordingly, the utility’s earnings should more closely reflect the rate of return allowed by the NMPRC. PNMR believes that achieving earnings that approximate its allowed rate of return is an important factor in attracting equity investors, as well as being considered favorably by credit rating agencies and financial analysts. 
As with any forward looking financial information, utilizing a FTY in a rate filing presents challenges. These include forecasts of both operating and capital expenditures that necessitate reliance on many assumptions concerning future conditions and operating results. In the rate making process, PNM’s assumptions are subject to challenge by regulators and intervenors who may assert different interpretations or assumptions. 
Renewable Energy
The REA was enacted to encourage the development of renewable energy in New Mexico. The act establishes a mandatory RPS requiring a utility to acquire a renewable energy portfolio equal to 15% of retail electric sales by 2015 and 20% by 2020. The act provides for streamlined proceedings for approval of utilities’ renewable energy procurement plans, assures utilities recovery of costs incurred consistent with approved procurement plans, and requires the NMPRC to establish a RCT for the procurement of renewable resources to prevent excessive costs being added to rates. PNM files required renewable energy plans with the NMPRC annually and makes procurements consistent with the plans approved by the NMPRC. See Note 17.
TNMP 
TNMP is a regulated utility operating and incorporated in the State of Texas. TNMP’s predecessor was organized in 1925. TNMP provides transmission and distribution services in Texas under the provisions of TECA and the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act. TNMP is subject to traditional cost-of-service regulation with respect to rates and service under the jurisdiction of the PUCT and certain municipalities. TNMP’s transmission and distribution activities are solely within ERCOT, which is the independent system operator responsible for maintaining reliable operations for the bulk electric power supply system in most of Texas. Therefore, TNMP is not subject to traditional rate regulation by FERC. TNMP serves a market of small to medium sized communities, most of which have populations of less than 50,000. TNMP is the exclusive provider of transmission and distribution services in most areas it serves. 
TNMP’s service territory consists of three non-contiguous areas. One portion of this territory extends from Lewisville, which is approximately 10 miles north of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, eastward to municipalities near the Red 
A - 4

River, and to communities north, west, and south of Fort Worth. The second portion of its service territory includes the area along the Texas Gulf Coast between Houston and Galveston, and the third portion includes areas of far west Texas between Midland and El Paso. 
TNMP provides transmission and distribution services at regulated rates to various REPs that, in turn, provide retail electric service to consumers within TNMP’s service area. For its volumetric load customers billed on KWh usage, TNMP experienced increases in weather-normalized retail KWh sales of 3.2% in 2018 and 1.2% in 2017. As of December 31, 2018, 99 active REPs receive transmission and distribution services from TNMP. In 2018, the three largest REP customers of TNMP accounted for 21%, 16%, and 12% of TNMP’s operating revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues.
Regulatory Activities
In July 2011, the PUCT approved a settlement and authorized an AMS deployment plan that permits TNMP to collect $113.4 million in deployment costs through a surcharge over a 12-year period. TNMP began collecting the surcharge on August 11, 2011 and deployment of advanced meters began in September 2011. TNMP completed its mass deployment of AMS in 2016 and has installed more than 242,000 advanced meters. The PUCT approved interim adjustments to TNMP’s transmission rates of $4.3 million in March 2016, $1.8 million in September 2016, $4.8 million in March 2017, $4.7 million in September 2017, and $0.6 million in March 2018. On January 25, 2019, TNMP filed an application to further update its transmission rates, which would increase revenues by $14.3 million annually. The application is pending before the PUCT. 
TNMP filed a general rate case application with the PUCT in May 2018 requesting an annual increase to base rates of $25.9 million based on a ROE of 10.5%, a cost of debt of 7.2%, and a capital structure comprised of 50% debt and 50% equity. TNMP’s application also proposed a new rate rider to recover Hurricane Harvey restoration and other costs, a request to increase depreciation rates, and a request to integrate revenues recorded under TNMP’s AMS rider, as well as other unrecovered AMS investments, into base rates. The application also proposed to return the regulatory liability recorded at December 31, 2017 related to federal tax reform to customers and to reduce its federal corporate income tax rate to 21%. On November 2, 2018, TNMP and other parties to the case filed an unopposed settlement agreement. The unopposed settlement was approved by the PUCT on December 20, 2018. The approved settlement agreement results in a $10.0 million annual increase to base rates and provides for a ROE of 9.65%, a cost of debt of 6.44%, and a capital structure comprised of 55% debt and 45% equity. The approved settlement integrates AMS revenues and other unrecovered AMS investments into base rates, adjusts how TNMP will return the regulatory liability recorded at December 31, 2017 related to federal tax reform to customers, grants TNMP’s request for updated depreciation rates, and provides for a new rider to recover Hurricane Harvey restoration and other costs. The approved settlement excludes from rate base certain transmission investments that were requested in TNMP’s original filing. These transmission investments were subsequently included in TNMP’s January 2019 transmission cost of service filing, which is pending before the PUCT. New rates under the TNMP 2018 Rate Case were effective beginning on January 1, 2019. See Note 17.
Franchise Agreements
TNMP holds long-term, non-exclusive franchise agreements for its electric transmission and distribution services. These agreements have varying expiration dates and some have expired. TNMP intends to negotiate and execute new or amended franchise agreements with municipalities where the agreements have expired or will be expiring. Since TNMP is the exclusive provider of transmission and distribution services in most areas that it serves, the need to renew or renegotiate franchise agreements should not have a material adverse impact. TNMP also earns revenues from service provided to facilities in its service area that lie outside the territorial jurisdiction of the municipalities with which TNMP has franchise agreements.
Corporate and Other
The Corporate and Other segment includes PNMR holding company activities, primarily related to corporate level debt and the activities of PNMR Services Company. PNMR Services Company provides corporate services through shared services agreements to PNMR and all of PNMR’s business units, including PNM and TNMP. These services are charged and billed at cost on a monthly basis to the business units. The activities of PNMR Development, NM Capital, and NMRD are also included in Corporate and Other.

A - 6

Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are 13% owned by PNM. These units are jointly owned with APS, SRP, Tucson, and NTEC, and are operated by APS. Prior to July 22, 2018, NTEC’s 7% share of Four Corners was owned by an affiliate of APS, which had acquired the interest from EPE on July 7, 2016. PNM had no ownership interest in Four Corners Units 1, 2, or 3, which were shut down by APS on December 30, 2013. The Four Corners plant site is located on land within the Navajo Nation and is subject to an easement from the federal government. APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to extend the owners’ right to operate the plant on the site to July 2041. See Note 16 for additional information about Four Corners.
PNM owns 100% of Reeves, Afton, Rio Bravo, Lordsburg, and La Luz and one-third of Luna. The remaining interests in Luna are owned equally by Tucson and Samchully Power & Utilities 1, LLC. PNM is also entitled to the entire output of Valencia under a PPA. Reeves, Lordsburg, Rio Bravo, La Luz, and Valencia are used primarily for peaking power and transmission support. As discussed in Note 10, Valencia is a variable interest entity and is consolidated by PNM as required by GAAP.
Nuclear Plant 
PNM is participating in the three units of PVNGS with APS (the operating agent), SRP, EPE, SCE, SCPPA, and the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles. PNM is entitled to 10.2%, including portions that are leased to PNM, of the power and energy generated by PVNGS. See Note 8 for additional information concerning the PVNGS leases. Currently, PNM has ownership interests of 2.3% in Unit 1, 9.4% in Unit 2, and 10.2% in Unit 3 and has leasehold interests of 7.9% in Unit 1 and 0.8% in Unit 2. The lease payments for the leased portions of PVNGS are recovered through retail rates approved by the NMPRC. See Note 16 for information on other PVNGS matters, including the NMPRC’s approval for PNM to include PVNGS Unit 3 as a jurisdictional resource to serve New Mexico retail customers beginning in 2018 and Note 17 for information concerning the NMPRC’s treatment of the purchased assets and extended leases in PNM’s NM 2015 Rate Case. See Note 8 for information concerning PNM’s option to purchase or return the assets underlying four leases in PVNGS Unit 1 and one lease in PVNGS Unit 2 that expire January 2023 and January 2024. 
Solar
At December 31, 2018, PNM owns a total of 107 MW of solar facilities in commercial operation. PNM is also entitled to the entire output from 30 MW of NMRD-owned solar facilities. As discussed in Note 1, NMRD is a 50% equity method investee of PNMR Development. As discussed in Note 17, PNM’s 2018 renewable energy procurement plan includes the addition of 50 MW of PNM-owned solar-PV facilities which are expected to be in commercial operation by December 2019. The NMPRC has approved a voluntary tariff that allows PNM retail customers to buy renewable electricity for a small monthly premium. Power from 1.5 MW of PNM’s solar capacity is used to service load under the voluntary tariff. 
Plant Operating Statistics
Equivalent availability of PNM’s major base-load generating stations was:

Plant | Operator | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
SJGS | PNM | 71.4% | 84.1% | 76.5%
Four Corners | APS | 61.7% | 50.6% | 62.0%
PVNGS | APS | 88.6% | 91.9% | 91.4%

Joint Projects
SJGS, PVNGS, Four Corners, and Luna are joint projects each owned or leased by several different entities. Some participants in the joint projects are investor-owned entities, while others are privately, municipally, or co-operatively owned. Furthermore, participants in SJGS have varying percentage interests in different generating units within the project. The primary operating or participation agreements for the joint projects expire in July 2022 for SJGS, July 2041 for Four Corners, December 2046 for Luna, and November 2047 for PVNGS. SJGS and Four Corners are coal-fired generating plants that obtain their coal requirements from mines near the plants. An agreement for coal supply for SJGS, which expires on June 30, 2022, became effective on January 31, 2016. At that same time, an agreement to restructure the ownership in SJGS became effective. The restructuring agreement provided for certain participants in SJGS to exit ownership at December 31, 2017, by which time SJGS Units 2 and 3 were required to be permanently shut down. See Note 16 for a discussion of the restructuring of SJGS ownership. In December 2013, a coal supply arrangement for Four Corners that runs through July 6, 2031 was executed. As described above, Four Corners is located on land within the Navajo Nation and is subject to an easement from the federal government. Portions of PNM’s interests in PVNGS Units 1 and 2 are held under leases. See Nuclear Plant above and Note 8 regarding PNM’s actions related to these leases. 
A - 7

On December 31, 2018, PNM submitted a filing with the NMPRC (the “December 2018 Compliance Filing”) indicating that, consistent with the conclusions reached in PNM’s 2017 IRP, PNM’s customers would benefit from the retirement of PNM’s share of SJGS (subject to future NMPRC approval) when the current coal supply and operating agreements governing the facility expire in mid-2022. PNM’s December 2018 Compliance Filing indicates that PNM has provided notice that it does not intend to extend the existing coal supply agreement beyond its current June 30, 2022 expiration date. In addition, PNM’s 2017 IRP also indicates customers would benefit from PNM’s exit from Four Corners when the current coal supply agreement for that facility expires in 2031. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information about PNM’s coal supply, PNM’s December 2018 Compliance Filing, and PNM’s 2017 IRP. It is possible that other participants in the joint projects have circumstances and objectives that have changed from those existing at the time of becoming participants. The status of these joint projects is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the form of potential legislation and/or regulation of GHG, other air emissions, and CCRs, as well as the impacts of the costs of compliance and operational viability of all or certain units within the joint projects. It is unclear how these factors will enter into discussions and negotiations concerning the status of the joint projects as the expiration of basic operational agreements approaches. PNM can provide no assurance that its participation in the joint projects will continue in the manner that currently exists.
PPAs 
In addition to generating its own power, PNM purchases power under long-term PPAs. PNM also purchases power in the forward, day-ahead, and real-time markets. 
In 2002, PNM entered into a 25-year agreement to purchase all of the power and RECs generated by New Mexico Wind. PNM began receiving power from the project in June 2003. FPL owns and operates New Mexico Wind, which currently consists of 136 wind-powered turbines having an aggregate capacity of 204 MW on a site in eastern New Mexico. PNM also has a 20-year agreement to purchase energy and RECs from the Lightning Dock Geothermal facility built near Lordsburg, New Mexico. The current capacity of the facility is 15 MW. PNM’s 2018 renewable plan filing, which was approved by the NMPRC on November 15, 2017, included requests to procure an additional 80 GWh in 2019 and 105 GWh in 2020 from a re-powering of New Mexico Wind and an additional 55 GWh in 2019 and 77 GWh in 2020 from a re-powering of Lightning Dock Geothermal. The PPAs now expire in 2044 for New Mexico Wind and 2042 for Lightning Dock Geothermal.
In June 2013, PNM entered into a 20-year PPA with Red Mesa Wind, LLC, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, to purchase all of the power and RECs produced by Red Mesa Wind beginning on January 1, 2015. Red Mesa Wind, LLC owns and operates the facility, which consists of 64 wind-powered turbines having an aggregate capacity of 102 MW on a site west of Albuquerque.
PNM and Tri-State have a hazard sharing agreement, which expires on May 31, 2022. Under this agreement, each party sells the other party 100 MW of capacity and energy from a designated generation resource on a unit contingent basis, subject to certain performance guarantees.  Both the purchases and sales are made at the same market index price.  This agreement serves to reduce the magnitude of each party’s single largest generating hazard and assists in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of their respective operations. See Note 17 for details related to purchases and sales. Since PNM purchases and sells approximately the same amount of energy under the hazard sharing agreement, it is not included as a capacity resource in the above table.
As discussed in Note 1, PNMR Development and AEP OnSite Partners created NMRD on September 22, 2017 to pursue the acquisition, development, and ownership of renewable energy generation projects primarily in the State of New Mexico. PNMR Development and AEP OnSite Partners each have a 50% ownership interest in NMRD, a limited liability company. In December 2017, PNMR Development made a contribution to NMRD of its interest in three 10 MW solar facilities and assigned its interests in several agreements related to those facilities to NMRD. AEP OnSite Partners made a cash contribution to NMRD equal to 50% of the value of the 30 MW solar capacity, which cash was then distributed from NMRD to PNMR Development.  Power from the 30 MWs of solar capacity is being sold to PNM under 25-year PPAs to supply renewable energy to a data center in PNM’s service territory. 
In March 2018, the NMPRC approved PNM’s request to enter into three separate 25-year PPAs to purchase renewable energy and RECs to be used by PNM to supply power to Facebook, Inc. These PPAs include the purchase of the power and RECs from an aggregate of 266 MW of wind and solar-PV generation facilities to be located in New Mexico. In November 2018, the 50 MW of capacity from Casa Mesa Wind was placed in commercial operation. PNM expects the remaining 216 MW of wind and solar-PV generating facilities will be in commercial operation by December 2021. In October 2018, the NMPRC approved PNM’s request to enter into two 25-year PPAs to purchase renewable energy and RECs from an aggregate of approximately 100 MW of capacity from two solar-PV facilities to be owned and operated by NMRD, which will also be used to supply power and RECs to Facebook. NMRD is required to obtain FERC approval of the PPAs. Subject to FERC approval, the first 50 MW of these facilities is expected to be in commercial operation by December 2019 and the remaining capacity is expected to be in

commercial operation by June 2020. The cost of these PPAs will be passed through to Facebook, Inc., under one of PNM’s NMPRC approved rate riders (Note 17).
A summary of purchased power, excluding Valencia, is as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Purchased under long-term PPAs | | | | | 
MWh | 1,626,300 | | | 1,574,716 | | | 1,211,852
Cost per MWh | $ | 32.49 | | | $ | 29.02 | | $ | 28.26

Cost per MWh | $ | 41.46 | | | $ | 31.74 | | $ | 27.78

TNMP
TNMP provides only transmission and distribution services and does not sell power.
FUEL AND WATER SUPPLY
PNM
The percentages (on the basis of KWh) of PNM’s generation of electricity, including Valencia, fueled by coal, nuclear fuel, and gas and oil, and the average costs to PNM of those fuels per MMBTU were as follows:

 | Coal | | Nuclear | | Gas and Oil 
 | Percent ofGeneration | | AverageCost | | Percent ofGeneration | AverageCost | | Percent ofGeneration | AverageCost
2018 | 44.7 | % | | $ | 2.60 | | 34.1 | % | $ | 0.58 | 18.5 | % | $ | 2.43
2017 | 56.5 | % | | $ | 2.16 | | 31.9 | % | $ | 0.64 | 9.2 | % | $ | 3.02
2016 | 54.1 | % | | $ | 2.34 | | 31.6 | % | $ | 0.71 | 11.8 | % | $ | 2.80

In 2018, 2017, and 2016, 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2.5% of PNM’s generation was from utility-owned solar, which has no fuel cost. In December 2017, SJGS Units 2 and 3 were retired and PNM assumed a greater interest in SJGS Unit 4, which results in a lower percentage of PNM’s electric generation capacity being fueled by coal. The generation mix for 2019 is expected to be 41.7% coal, 30.3% nuclear, 24.8% gas and oil, and 3.2% utility-owned solar. Due to locally available natural gas and oil supplies, the utilization of locally available coal deposits, and the generally adequate supply of nuclear fuel, PNM believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future. See Sources of Power – PNM – PPAs for information concerning the cost of purchased power. PNM recovers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power costs through the FPPAC.
Coal
A coal supply contract for SJGS, which expires on June 30, 2022, became effective on January 31, 2016. Coal supply has not been arranged for periods after the existing contract expires. Substantially all of the benefits of lower coal pricing under the new contract are being passed through to PNM’s customers under the FPPAC. PNM believes there is adequate availability of coal resources to continue to operate SJGS through mid-2022.
In late December 2013, a fifteen-year coal supply contract for Four Corners, which began in July 2016, was executed. The average coal price per ton under the new contract was approximately 51% higher in the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 than in the twelve months ended June 30, 2016 and approximately 6.9% higher in the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 than in the twelve months ended June 30, 2017. The contract provides for pricing adjustments over its term based on economic indices. 
As discussed above, PNM’s December 2018 Compliance Filing indicates that, consistent with the conclusions reached in PNM’s 2017 IRP, PNM’s customers would benefit from the retirement of PNM’s share of SJGS (subject to future NMPRC approval) after the current coal supply agreement expires in mid-2022 and that PNM does not intend to extend the SJGS CSA beyond that time. See Note 16 for additional information about PNM’s December 2018 Compliance Filing and PNM’s coal supply. As discussed in Note 17, PNM’s 2017 IRP also indicates that PNM exiting ownership in Four Corners after the end of its current coal supply agreement in 2031 would provide long-term cost savings to PNM’s customers.

Natural Gas
The natural gas used as fuel for the electric generating plants is procured on the open market and delivered by third-party transportation providers. The supply of natural gas can be subject to disruptions due to extreme weather events and/or pipeline or facility outages. PNM has contracted for firm gas transmission capacity to minimize the potential for disruptions due to extreme weather events. Certain of PNM’s natural gas plants are generally used as peaking resources that are highly relied upon during seasonally high load periods and/or during periods of extreme weather, which also may be the times natural gas has the highest demand from other users. PNM’s reliance on its natural gas generating resources has increased with the December 2017 retirement of SJGS Units 2 and 3. Substantially all of PNM’s natural gas costs are recovered through the FPPAC. 
Nuclear Fuel and Waste
PNM is one of several participants in PVNGS. The PVNGS participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The PVNG participants have contracted for 100% of PVNGS’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2025 and 15% of its requirements through 2028. In 2018, PVNGS executed five uranium contracts covering the time period from 2019 to 2025. The PVNGS participants have also contracted for 100% of the requirements for conversion services through 2025 and 40% of its requirements through 2030. A long-term contract for conversion services was executed in 2018 covering the time period from 2019 to 2030. The PVNGS participants have also contracted for 100% of the requirements for enrichment services through 2021, 90% of enrichment services for 2022, and 80% of its enrichment services for 2023 through 2026. In 2018, four enrichment contracts were executed to bring coverage to these levels. All of PVNGS’s fuel assembly fabrication services are contracted through 2027. In 2018, a fabrication contract was executed with a new fabrication supplier for Unit 2, and the existing fabrication contract was renegotiated for Units 1 and 3.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the DOE to begin to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998. The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a contract with each nuclear power plant. The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998. APS (on behalf of itself and the other PVNGS participants) pursued legal actions for which settlements were reached. See Note 16 for information concerning these actions. 
The DOE had planned to meet its disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the NRC. Several interested parties have intervened in the NRC proceeding. Additionally, a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the DOE’s authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. None of these lawsuits has been conclusively decided by the courts. However, in August 2013, the DC Circuit ordered the NRC to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds.
On October 16, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure, and its issuance is a key milestone in the Yucca Mountain licensing process. Volume 3 contains the NRC staff’s finding that the DOE’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed, including but not limited to the post-closure performance objectives in NRC’s regulations. On December 18, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository and documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the DOE’s research and development and performance confirmation programs, as well as other administrative controls and systems, meet applicable NRC requirements. Volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in NRC regulations are met, except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights. Publication of Volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository.
All spent nuclear fuel from PVNGS is being stored on site. PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license periods, which end in December 2027. Additionally, PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the extended license periods, which end in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, the PVNGS participants will evaluate alternative storage solutions. These may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the extended license periods. 
Water Supply
See Note 16 for information about PNM’s water supply.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Electric utilities are subject to stringent laws and regulations for protection of the environment by local, state, federal, and tribal authorities. In addition, PVNGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC, which has the authority to issue permits and licenses and to regulate nuclear facilities in order to protect the health and safety of the public from radioactive hazards and to conduct environmental reviews. The liabilities under these laws and regulations can be material. In some instances, liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault, or may be imposed for past acts, whether or not such acts were lawful at the time they occurred. See MD&A – Other Issues Facing the Company – Climate Change Issues for information on GHG. In addition, Note 16 contains information related to the following matters, incorporated in this item by reference:

• | PVNGS Decommissioning Funding


• | Nuclear Spent Fuel and Waste Disposal


• | Environmental Matters under the caption “The Clean Air Act”


• | WEG v. OSM NEPA Lawsuit


• | Navajo Nation Environmental Issues


• | Cooling Water Intake Structures

• | Santa Fe Generating Station


• | Environmental Matters under the caption “Coal Combustion Residuals Waste Disposal”


• | Environmental Matters under the caption “Coal Supply”

COMPETITION
Regulated utilities are generally not subject to competition from other utilities in areas that are under the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions. In New Mexico, PNM does not have direct competition for services provided to its retail electric customers. In Texas, TNMP is not currently in any direct retail competition with any other regulated electric utility. However, PNM and TNMP are subject to customer conservation and energy efficiency activities, as well as initiatives to utilize alternative energy sources, including self-generation, or otherwise bypass the PNM and TNMP systems. 
PNM is subject to varying degrees of competition in certain territories adjacent to or within the areas it serves. This competition comes from other utilities in its region as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities.  PNM is involved in the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market although PNM has decided to stop pursuing wholesale generation contracts.  PNM is subject to competition from regional utilities and merchant power suppliers with similar opportunities to generate and sell energy at market-based prices and larger trading entities that do not own or operate generating assets.
