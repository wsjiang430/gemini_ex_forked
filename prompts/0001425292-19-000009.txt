Item 1.    Business
Overview
CVR Partners, LP (“CVR Partners,” or the “Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2011 by CVR Energy, Inc. (“CVR Energy”) to own, operate and grow our nitrogen fertilizer business. We produce and distribute nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. References to CVR Partners, the Partnership, “we”, “us”, and “our” may refer to consolidated subsidiaries of CVR Partners or one or both of the facilities, as the context may require. Additionally, as the context may require, references to CVR Energy may refer to CVR Energy, its consolidated subsidiaries which include CVR Refining, LP and its petroleum refining, marketing and logistics operations. Our principal products are ammonia and UAN. All of our products are sold on a wholesale basis. We produce nitrogen fertilizer products at two manufacturing facilities, which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois.
Organizational Structure and Related Ownership
The following chart illustrates the organizational structure of the Partnership as of December 31, 2018.

December 31, 2018 | 4

Subsequent to December 31, 2018, the general partner of CVR Refining, LP (“CVRR”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Energy, assigned to CVR Energy its right to purchase all of the issued and outstanding CVRR common units not already owned by CVRR’s general partner or its affiliates. On January 29, 2019, CVR Energy purchased all remaining CVRR common units not already owned by CVR Energy or its affiliates (the “Public Unit Purchase”). In conjunction with the Public Unit Purchase, CVR Energy purchased all CVRR common units owned by Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“IEP”) and its subsidiary, American Entertainment Properties Corporation (the “Affiliate Unit Purchase,” and together with the Public Unit Purchase, the “CVRR Unit Purchase”). The CVRR Unit Purchase had no impact on the Partnership, its operations, or CVR Energy’s ownership in the Partnership.
Facilities
We own and operate nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas (the “Coffeyville Facility”) and East Dubuque, Illinois (the “East Dubuque Facility”). We produce and distribute nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The principal products are UAN and ammonia, and all products are sold on a wholesale basis. 
The Coffeyville Facility includes a a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, a 1,300 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 3,000 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit. The Coffeyville Facility is the only nitrogen fertilizer plant in North America that utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The Coffeyville Facility’s largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is pet coke, which it purchases from CVR Energy and third parties. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Partnership purchased approximately $13 million, $8 million and $8 million, respectively, of pet coke at an average cost per ton of $28, $17 and $15, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we upgraded approximately 93%, 88% and 93%, respectively, of our ammonia production into UAN, a product that presently generates greater profit than ammonia. We upgrade substantially all of our ammonia production at the Coffeyville Facility into UAN and will continue to do so when the economics are favorable.
The East Dubuque Facility, which includes a 1,075 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit, has the flexibility to vary its product mix enabling the East Dubuque Facility to upgrade a portion of its ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. The East Dubuque Facility’s largest raw material expense used in the production of ammonia is natural gas, which we purchase from third parties. The East Dubuque Facility’s natural gas process results in a higher percentage of variable costs as compared to the Coffeyville Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, and 2017 the East Dubuque Facility incurred approximately $22.5 million and $26.3 million for feedstock natural gas, respectively, which equaled an average cost of $3.15 and $3.26 per MMBtu, respectively.
Commodities
The nitrogen products we produce are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for its products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of its products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand.
Agriculture 
The three primary forms of nitrogen fertilizer used in the United States of America are ammonia, urea and UAN. Unlike ammonia and urea, UAN can be applied throughout the growing season and can be applied in tandem with pesticides and herbicides, providing farmers with flexibility and cost savings. As a result of these factors, UAN typically commands a premium price to urea and ammonia, on a nitrogen equivalent basis.
Nutrients are depleted in soil over time and therefore must be replenished through fertilizer use. Nitrogen is the most quickly depleted nutrient and must be replenished every year, whereas phosphate and potassium can be retained in soil for up to three years. Plants require nitrogen in the largest amounts and it accounts for approximately 57% of primary fertilizer consumption on a nutrient ton basis, per the International Fertilizer Industry Association.

Demand
Global demand for fertilizers is driven primarily by grain demand and prices, which, in turn, are driven by population growth, farmland per capita, dietary changes in the developing world and increased consumption of bio-fuels. According to the International Fertilizer Industry Association, from 1974 to 2016, global fertilizer demand grew 2% annually. Global fertilizer use, consisting of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium, is projected to increase by 34% between 2010 and 2030 to meet global food demand according to a study funded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Currently, the developed world uses fertilizer more intensively than the developing world, but sustained economic growth in emerging markets is increasing food demand and fertilizer use. In addition, populations in developing countries are shifting to more protein-rich diets as their incomes increase, with such consumption requiring more grain for animal feed. As an example, China’s wheat and coarse grains production is estimated to have increased 32% between 2007 and 2018, but still failed to keep pace with increases in demand, prompting China to grow its wheat and coarse grain imports by more than 1,320% over the same period, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
The United States is the world’s largest exporter of coarse grains, accounting for 33% of world exports and 29% of world production for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, according to the USDA. A substantial amount of nitrogen is consumed in production of these crops to increase yield. Based on Fertecon Limited’s (“Fertecon”) 2018 estimates, the United States is the world’s third largest consumer of nitrogen fertilizer and the world’s largest importer of nitrogen fertilizer. Fertecon is a reputable agency which provides market information and analysis on fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials for fertilizer and related industries, and international agencies. Fertecon estimates indicate that the United States represented 12% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption for 2018, with China and India as the top consumers representing 23% and 15% of total global nitrogen fertilizer consumption, respectively. 
North American nitrogen fertilizer producers predominantly use natural gas as their primary feedstocks. Over the last five years, U.S. oil and natural gas reserves have increased significantly due to, among other factors, advances in extracting shale oil and gas as well as relatively high oil and gas prices. More recently, global demand has slowed with production staying steady even as oil and gas prices have declined substantially over the past two years. This has led to significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices as compared to historical prices. As a result, North America has become a low-cost region for nitrogen fertilizer production.
Raw Material Supply
Coffeyville Facility - During the past five years, just under 70% (2018 - 59%) of the Coffeyville Facility’s pet coke requirements on average were supplied by CVR Energy’s adjacent Coffeyville, Kansas refinery pursuant to a multi-year agreement. Historically the Coffeyville Facility has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements through third party contracts typically priced at a discount to the spot market. In 2018, a larger amount of third party purchases were made at spot prices due to less supply being available from the Coffeyville refinery. Additionally, the Coffeyville Facility relies on a third-party air separation plant at its location that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the Coffeyville Facility gasifiers. Refer to Note 8 ("Commitments and Contingencies") within the “Lease and Supply Commitments” section, for further discussion on the matters outlined above.
East Dubuque Facility - The East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The East Dubuque Facility is able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and a third-party owned and operated pipeline. The pipelines are connected to a third-party distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect from which natural gas is transported to the East Dubuque Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase approximately 1.4 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in our East Dubuque Facility in January and February 2019 at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately $3.84, exclusive of transportation cost.

Marketing and Distribution
We primarily market UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers. UAN and ammonia accounted for approximately 72% and 20%, respectively, of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a free-on-board (“FOB”) shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. We operate a fleet of railcars for product delivery. If delivered by railcar, our products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis and we typically arrange the freight. 
The nitrogen fertilizer products leave the Coffeyville Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific railroad. the BNSF Railway railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. The East Dubuque Facility primarily sells its product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque Facility and arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. Additionally, the East Dubuque Facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company. 
Customers
We sell UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, we sell ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, most of our contracts with customers are for a term of 12-month or less. Some of our industrial sales include long-term purchase contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the top five customers in the aggregate represented 32% of net sales. The Partnership’s top customer on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 14% of net sales. 
Competition
Our business has experienced and expects to continue to meet significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. We seasonally adjust inventory to enhance our manufacturing and distribution operations.
Our major competitors include CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.; Koch Fertilizer Company, LLC; and Nutrien Ltd. (formerly known as Agrium, Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.). Domestic competition is intense due to customers’ sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. We also encounter competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments. 
The decline of natural gas prices in recent periods have led to existing and new producers considering construction of new or expanding existing nitrogen fertilizer production facilities in the United States. The substantial majority of the incremental nitrogen fertilizer supply associated with the construction of confirmed new production facilities is expected to be online in 2018. Once the increased production comes on-line, Blue, Johnson & Associates, Inc., a company management considers to provide reliable fertilizer industry forecasts, expects the United States will still require net imports into the United States to meet domestic demand for nitrogen fertilizers. 
Seasonality
Because we primarily sell agricultural commodity products, our business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers’ current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. We typically experience

higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and its net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season. 
Environmental Matters
Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of our nitrogen fertilizer products. These laws and regulations and the enforcement thereof impact us by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products we market, primarily UAN and ammonia.

Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
The Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”)
The CAA and its implementing regulations, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations governing air emissions, affect us through the CAA’s permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain substances. The CAA indirectly affects us by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide (“SO2”), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and other substances, including those emitted by mobile sources, which are direct or indirect users of our products. Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to our nitrogen fertilizer facilities (collectively referred to as the “Facilities”) to maintain compliance. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material. 
The regulation of air emissions under the CAA requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the New Source Performance Standards and the New Source Review. 
Release Reporting
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our Facilities periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from their equipment. From time to time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if a release violates the law or our permits, we could become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions (“GHG”)
The EPA regulates GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. In October 2009, the EPA finalized a rule requiring certain large emitters of GHGs to inventory and report their GHG emissions to the EPA. In accordance with the rule, our facilities monitor and report our GHG emissions to the EPA. In May 2010, the EPA finalized the “Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule,” which established GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources, such as the nitrogen fertilizer plant, must obtain permits under Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V programs of the federal Clean Air Act. Under the rule, facilities already subject to the PSD and Title V programs that increase their emissions of GHGs by a significant amount are required to undergo PSD review and to evaluate and implement air pollution control technology, known as “best available control technology,” to reduce GHG emissions. 
Environmental Remediation
As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by crude oil or hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. There is no assurance that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to the release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or crude oil for which we have potential liability or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material. 
Environmental Insurance
We are covered by CVR Energy’s site pollution legal liability insurance policy. The policy includes business interruption coverage. The policy insures any location owned, leased, rented or operated by the Partnership, including our Facilities. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at, or migrating from, a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we benefit from umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies maintained by CVR Energy. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period. 
The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies are subject to retentions and deductibles and contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Health, Safety and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.
We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership had approximately 290 employees across both of its facilities and its logistics operations, including approximately 100 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in October 2019. We also rely on the services of employees of CVR Energy and its subsidiaries pursuant to a services agreement between us, CVR Energy and our general partner.
