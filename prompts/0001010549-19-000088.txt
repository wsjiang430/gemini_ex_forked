Our Corporate History and Background
 
The Company was organized on October 4, 2011 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name SMSA Ballinger Acquisition Corp. to effect the reincorporation of Senior Management Services of Heritage Oaks at Ballinger, Inc., a Texas corporation, mandated by a Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court For the Northern District of Texas for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
Reverse Acquisition of Tiger Trade
 
On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), by and among the Company, Tiger Trade Technologies, Inc. (“Tiger Trade”), a Texas corporation and the stockholders of Tiger Trade.  Under the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement, the Company offered and sold 17,900,000 newly issued shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.001 ("Common Stock") and 5,000,000 newly issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Company Preferred Stock”) in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares of Tiger Trade capital stock. The effect of the issuance was that, upon closing of the Exchange Agreement transaction, former Tiger Trade stockholders held approximately 85.91% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock. 
 
As a condition precedent to consummation of the Exchange Agreement, Orsolya Peresztegi, the Company’s sole officer and director on the closing date of the transaction, effected the cancellation of 7,095,602 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a Cancellation Agreement effective as of the Exchange Agreement closing date. Under the terms of the Cancellation Agreement, Tiger Trade paid Ms. Peresztegi a cancellation fee of Two Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Dollars ($245,000).
 
As a result of the Exchange Agreement and Cancellation Agreement transactions described above, the Tiger Trade stockholders acquired as of the date the transaction closed, in the aggregate, approximately 88.64% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis, and Tiger Trade became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Under the Exchange Agreement, (1) Orsolya Peresztegi, the Company’s sole officer on the closing date, resigned as an officer of the Company and Gust Kepler was appointed as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company, and (2) Mr. Kepler was appointed to serve as a director of the Company. Ms. Peresztegi subsequently resigned as a director of the Company effective January 4, 2016.

Overview of Business
 
The Company is in the business of developing and marketing web and mobile based analytical software tools as a subscription based software as a service (the “Blackbox System”) that serves as tool for stock and option traders to evaluate prospective investments on various securities exchanges and markets. Our proprietary Blackbox System technology is an algorithm driven system that works in real time, measuring market trends and data while utilizing a multitude of specific criteria, both live and historical. Our servers, located in close proximity to the NYSE, NASDAQ and OTC exchanges drive our proprietary algorithms at near light speed. Our Blackbox System platform employs predictive technology enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that can result in the rapid change in a stock’s price. The Blackbox System was initially designed to monitor and analyze over 13,000 stocks on the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC”), New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NYSE American (formerly the American Stock Exchange) and NASDAQ markets simultaneously as our servers receive live data feeds from such markets. We have also customized a separate Blackbox System platform (“Asian Blackbox System”) to analyze data from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (“HKEX”), Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”) for license and use primarily in Asia. We consider the Blackbox System technology to be among the most user-friendly of its kind.
 
The Blackbox System employs predictive technology enhanced by artificial intelligence to identify volatility and unusual market activity that may result in rapid change in the price of a stock. The complexity of our backend analytics is neatly hidden from the end user by our simple and easy to navigate dashboard which includes real-time alerts, scans, news and institutional grade analytics. Additionally, our users are provided a fully interactive chat and social media platform, integrated in our dashboard. This allows users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently. Recently, a live audio-video feature was introduced which allows our subscribers the ability to broadcast and share trade strategies and market insight, on their own channels within the Blackbox community.
 
The Blackbox System is a unique and disruptive financial technology platform, combining proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media, to connect traders of all types worldwide in our ultimate user-friendly system.
 
Development of the Blackbox System
 
Blackbox System was made available for use to US subscribing customers in September 2016 and the Asian Blackbox System was made available for use by under a license arrangement to subscribers in May 2017.
 
In December 2017 we launched our first Options Flow Scanner as a new feature on our platform. Our Options Flow Scanner is designed to monitor and alert our users to unusual activity on the options exchange. We have created many proprietary options alerts and a proprietary options “heatmap” to allow our users to follow large options purchases in real-time. This has proven to be a very popular feature for our users. We are also currently developing a Dark Pool Scanner. The Dark Pool Scanner feature monitors, tracks and displays large blocks of stock that are often purchased in dark pools and not on the regular exchanges.
 
In addition to the above described proprietary scanners and features, we provide our users with a full set of internal social media functions within our dashboard. These features include chat rooms, direct messaging, follow/block capability, custom user profiles, and most importantly broadcast enabled audio channels. We believe that combining these social media features with our analytics, within a single dashboard provides a unique user experience allowing for the rapid exchange of information throughout our user community.
 
We anticipate adding many new features and functions to the Blackbox System that we expect to make available in the second quarter of 2019, including but not limited to, native iOS and Android applications, a watchlist feature and enhanced filters for our Options Flow and Dark Pool Scanners. We also plan to upgrade our current “many to many” audio broadcast feature. Development of planned features and functions are expected to cost approximately

$220,000 and will be dependent upon resources available from anticipated financing.
 
Marketing of the Blackbox System
 
The Company launched its Blackbox System web application for domestic use and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Use of the Blackbox System is sold on a monthly or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com. We believe our Blackbox System subscriptions are priced competitively with similar web-based trading tools. Since launch, we have marketed our system to potential subscribers primarily via online and referral based marketing. Thus far we have achieved a majority of our subscriber base via our customer referral program. We have been offering certain subscribers the right to promote the Blackbox System and receive referral fees for subscribers generated from such subscribers’ effort. Generally, we pay referring subscribers $25 for each subscription generated and $25 for each month a referred subscriber continues its subscription. We incurred $90,278 and $45,866 in customer referral expenditures in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These equal approximately 12% and 11% of our subscription sales revenues generated in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We intend to expand the customer referral sales program as it has proven to be an extremely efficient form of advertising. Our future marketing efforts are expected to include, but will not be limited to, online affiliate marketing, banner advertising, social media, television and targeted email campaigns. We have run multiple small digital ad campaigns targeting social media platforms such Facebook and Instagram. We have also deployed marketing budgets on StockTwits. We recently began test marketing on Google as well. We intend to deploy a significant amount of marketing funds on these and other digital platforms including YouTube, Twitter and LinkedIn. Our test marketing has proven very effective and we believe we have the ability to scale our advertising efforts using these platforms. We have designated a preliminary budget of up $275,000 for digital advertising. However, such budget may change depending upon resources available from anticipated financing.
 
In September of 2018 we also began offering our users a comprehensive 3 hour educational course entitled “Blackbox Bootcamp.” This course is offered to our users twice weekly and teaches the basic of stocks, options, and how to use the Blackbox System. These classes are offered in a live webinar format with Q&A sessions. We also offer other webinar courses that are scheduled and announced on our calendar and in email and direct messages via our platform to our users. We believe that the implementation of this educational program has and will continue to increase our user retention.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
The Company offers its subscribing customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of our Blackbox System or the services provided.

Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the development of investment software tools and services and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of development and marketing operations are limited. We must compete for such resources with startups, major financial services companies and midsize competitors. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Our current operating and financial resources are not adequate to preclude any significant disruption of our operations. 
 
We consider our platform unique and do not consider any trading tools or trading analytics software direct competitors of our Company. There are many trading tools on the current market often referred to as “scanners”, that provide features, functions and analytics similar to those of the Blackbox System. There are also many social media platforms that cater to stock traders that serve as real-time informational sources. However, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or “scanner” and a social media platform within the same “dashboard” allowing users to view the same real-time data in parallel. Our Blackbox System creates a unique community for traders that can all share the same information and analyze this information on an identical analytics in real-time. We also consider our system unique because our predictive algorithms automatically populate alerts for active stocks with high probability of short-term gains. In spite of these factors that differentiate us, we believe the following companies that could be considered competitors due to some like features and retail price point: Trade Ideas, Flow Algo, Trade Alert and Wall Street Jesus.
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, the Company has three full-time employees, including Gust Kepler who serves as our sole director and our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Jeff Sharrock, who serves as Vice President of Operations and an administrative employee.
