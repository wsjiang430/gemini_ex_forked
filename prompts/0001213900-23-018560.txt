Item 1. Business
Our Business
An Overview
We are a commercial stage bioelectronic medicine and wellness company dedicated to improving health through our non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (“nVNS”) technology platform. Our focus is the commercialization of medical devices for the management and treatment of certain medical conditions and consumer product offerings utilizing nVNS to promote general wellbeing and human performance in the United States and select overseas markets. 
nVNS is a platform bioelectronic technology that modulates neurotransmitters through its effects on both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Our nVNS treatment is delivered through a proprietary high-frequency burst waveform that safely and comfortably passes through the skin and stimulates therapeutically relevant fibers in the vagus nerve. Various scientific publications suggest that nVNS works through several mechanistic pathways including the modulation of neurotransmitters.
Historically, vagus nerve stimulation or VNS, required an invasive surgical procedure to implant a costly medical device. This limitation has generally limited VNS from being used by anyone other than the most severe patients. Our medical devices and wellness products are self-administered and intended for regular or intermittent use over many years.
Our business is supported by our in-house capabilities spanning product development, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, product testing, assembly, and fulfillment, and customer support. We derive revenues from the sale of medical devices and wellness products in the United States and select overseas markets. We have two principal product categories:

• | Handheld, personal use medical devices for the management and treatment of certain medical conditions; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Handheld, personal use consumer product offerings utilizing nVNS technology to promote general wellbeing and human performance.

We believe our nVNS treatment may be used in the future to effectively treat additional medical conditions or improve human performance.
Primary Marketed Products and Business Strategy
Our goal is to be a leader in non-invasive neuromodulation by using our proprietary nVNS platform technology to deliver better health. To achieve this, we offer multiple propositions:

• | gammaCore for the treatment of certain medical conditions such as primary headache; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Truvaga for the support of general health and wellbeing; and 
• | TAC-STIM for human performance as defined by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory.

Our flagship model, gammaCore Sapphire, is a prescription medical device currently FDA cleared for a variety of primary headache conditions. gammaCore is available by prescription only and Sapphire is a portable, reusable, rechargeable and reloadable personal use option for patients to use at home or on the go. Prescriptions are written by a health care provider and dispensed from a specialty pharmacy, through the patient’s healthcare system, or fulfilled directly to certain patients in the United States directly from our facility in Rockaway, NJ. After the initial prescription is filled, access to additional therapy can be refilled for certain of our gammaCore products periodically through the input of a prescription-only authorization.
Truvaga is a personal use consumer electronics wellness product that does not require a prescription and is available direct-to-consumer from electroCore at www.truvaga.com. Truvaga is not intended for medical use. TAC-STIM is a form of nVNS for human performance and has been developed in collaboration with the United States Department of Defense Biotech Optimized for Operational Solutions and Tactics, or BOOST program. We are exploring strategies to make this product offering available to other branches of the active-duty military and certain human performance professionals in the United States and abroad. TAC-STIM is available as a Commercial Off the Shelf (COtS) solution to professional organizations and is the subject of ongoing research within the United States Air Force Special Operations Command and at the United States Air Force Research Laboratory.
 Truvaga and TAC-STIM are intended for general wellness in compliance with the FDA guidance document entitled “General Wellness: Policy for Low-Risk Devices; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, issued on September 27 2019”. They are not intended to treat medical conditions.

We have generally focused most of our historical sales efforts in two channels, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, or VA/DOD, and the United Kingdom utilizing our FDA cleared and CE marked product, gammaCore.
The United States Department of Veteran Affairs comprised 60.8% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect that a majority of our 2023 sales will be made pursuant to our qualifying contract under the Federal Supply Schedule or FSS, which was secured by us in December 2018, as well as open market sales to individual facilities within the government channels. The FSS is scheduled to expire on January 15, 2024. We intend to request an extension of the FSS from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, but there is no assurance the FSS agreement will be renewed, if at all, or at terms favorable to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Our sales function in this channel is comprised of employees and independent contractors.
Sales under the MTFM program for cluster headache in the UK comprised 15.1% of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2023, we plan on continued expansion under this program, as well as continue to utilize distribution partners to commercialize our nVNS technology in territories outside the United States and United Kingdom. In 2023, we expect the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, to review the guidance document and any changes in recommendation or pricing may adversely impact our ability to work with the National Health Service, or NHS, England on the MTFM program and could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
 We believe there may be significant opportunities beyond these areas. In 2023, therefore, we plan to continue our investment in expanded commercial adoption of gammaCore with cash pay, physician dispense, and direct-to-consumer approaches, and continue our early efforts to begin building wellness and human performance propositions through Truvaga and TAC-STIM.
Primary Headache Market and Competition for our gammaCore Products
In the United States, 39 million patients are affected by migraine, with more than 28 million being adult women. Migraine attacks can be extremely disabling and more than 90% of migraine sufferers are unable to work or function normally while experiencing migraine. According to a recent analysis, the annual economic burden of migraine in the United States is approximately $78 billion. Further, it is estimated that the annual total direct and indirect costs of all migraine-related health services are between $8,500 and $9,500 for an individual patient with chronic migraine. In the United States and EU, research has found that the age of first diagnosis of migraine peaks in the early-to-mid teens and the disease continues to persist throughout adulthood for many of these sufferers, demonstrating that it is often a disorder of long duration.
The marketing landscape for the treatment and prevention of migraine is highly competitive with most migraine patients managing their conditions with over-the-counter therapies. The triptan drug class is the current first line therapy for the acute treatment of migraine. According to the U.S. Pharmacist, a leading pharmacy publication, more than 60% of patients have reported dissatisfaction with, or have contraindications to, the current standard of care, such as triptan medications. There are many additional pharmaceutical approaches currently marketed and under development by third parties.
There are several neuromodulation devices that have been marketed for the treatment of migraine, including CEFALY (sold by CEFALY technologies sprl) and Nerivio (sold by Theranica Bioelectronics), as well as other neuromodulation devices that may be marketed for use in treating pain associated with primary headache. Cefaly has been granted OTC clearance allowing it to be sold without a prescription and the impact of this clearance on the competitive landscape remains to be seen.
The estimated prevalence of CH in the United States ranges from 0.1% to 0.2% of the total population, with an estimated 400,000 patients. CH is a condition in which patients experience extremely painful headache attacks that have been described by patients and physicians as some of the most painful known. CH predominantly affects males in their prime earning ages of 20 to 50, and the attacks of pain occur in bouts, known as cluster periods, during which attacks are experienced at a frequency ranging from every other day to as often as eight times per day. Individual attacks typically last from 15 minutes to as long as three hours. Among CH patients, 85% to 90% experience eCH, with their cluster periods, or bouts, lasting from two to 12 weeks, followed by a remission period, often cycling into bouts twice per year. According to a February 2020 published study in The American Journal of Managed Care, the overall average medical costs for eCH patients over a three-year period exceeded $22,500, compared with $10,140 among non-headache sufferers. Similarly, the overall average pharmacy costs per episodic CH patient during this period were $8,200, which was nearly double that of the non-headache sufferers. Participants in surveys of sufferers indicate that CH is associated with a large socioeconomic burden. For example, research found that nearly 20% of patients with CH reported loss of employment and approximately 8% are unemployed or receiving disability services due to the disorder. 
In the United Kingdom, the estimated prevalence of CH ranges from 0.1% to 0.2% of the total population, with approximately 66,000 affected patients.
Injectable sumatriptan (Imitrex) is an FDA-approved commercially available therapy for the acute treatment for CH. The side effect profile and cost of Imitrex, however, limits patients to treating only a small fraction of their attacks each month and has to be subcutaneously injected, which may be particularly difficult to do during an active CH attack. The most frequently used acute treatments for CH attacks are subcutaneous sumatriptan and high flow rate inhaled oxygen. Alternative treatments include intranasal triptans and intravenous dihydroergotamine, or DHE. Galcanezumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of episodic CH. Additional medications that are used by patients off-label include verapamil, lithium, and valproate. 
Our gammaCore therapy competes and will compete with numerous existing therapies from many different sources, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and other healthcare companies, and therapies that may become available in the future. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the potential success of our therapy are safety, efficacy, side effect profile, convenience, price, the availability of generic drugs and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and certain other third-party payers.
Market and Competition for our General Wellness Products
In April 2021, McKinsey & Company, or McKinsey estimated the global wellness market to be more than $1.5 trillion with annual growth of 5-10%, With the US market, spanning health, fitness, appearance, sleep, nutrition, and mindfulness, to be more than $450 billion and growing at great than 5% annually.
With the U.S. market, spanning health, fitness, appearance, sleep, nutrition, and mindfulness, estimated to be more than $450 billion and growing at greater than 5% annually. In a survey McKinsey conducted in August 2020 with roughly 7,500 customers in Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, 79% of the respondents said they believed wellness is important, and 42% considered it a top priority. Around 37% of surveyed consumers expressed a desire for additional products and services in both the sleep and mindfulness categories, with almost 1/3 of customers wanting more across the remaining four wellness dimensions.
Research and Development
We are developing future iterations of nVNS technology, including the use of our intellectual property around the delivery of smartphone-integrated and smartphone-connected non-invasive therapies. 
We are supporting a variety of Investigator Initiated Trials (IIT) to evaluate additional indications and/or markets for our products. If successful, we believe these trials will provide marketing support for future expansion of our business to new indications and markets.
Regulatory Clearances
Prescription
gammaCore, which is our prescription only, handheld device intended for regular or intermittent use over many years, is cleared by the FDA for use in the following indications:

• | the acute treatment of pain associated with each of migraine headache and episodic cluster headache in adults, or eCH; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the preventive treatment of migraine headache and adjunctive use for the preventive treatment of cluster headache in adults, or CH;
• | the acute and preventive treatment of migraine in adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age; and 
• | the treatment of Paroxysmal Hemicrania, or PH, and Hemicrania Continua, or HC, in adults. 

The FDA clearances of our gammaCore therapy to treat headache were facilitated by the FDA's creation of a new regulatory category: External Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Headache (21 CFR 882-5892). Based on this category’s description, we anticipate that some additional label expansions may be possible through the pathway under Section 510(k) of the Federal Drug and Cosmetic Act.
In January 2022, the FDA granted gammaCore Sapphire “Breakthrough Device designation for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD”. PTSD is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder with limited approved treatment options. The FDA’s Breakthrough Device designation is designed to expedite the development and regulatory review of medical devices that hold the potential for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition.
We also are considering several additional medical indications for our nVNS technology which are being studied in several investigator-initiated trials, or IITs. These indications include, post-traumatic stress disorder, opioid use disorders, symptoms of Parkinson's disease, stroke, concussion, attention, nausea, mood, fatigue and memory retention among others.
We received a CE Certificate of Conformity for gammaCore for the treatment of primary headache from the British Standards Institution, a European Union notified body. This CE Certificate of Conformity allowed us to affix the CE Mark on gammaCore and to commercialize it in the European Economic Area and other countries that recognize the CE Mark. In addition, we received CE Certificates of Conformity on gammaCore covering four other indications for use, including reactive airway disease and gastric motility disorders.
In 2019, NICE, published a Medical Technology Guidance document recommending the use of gammaCore for CH within NHS of England and Wales. We expect NICE to review the Medical Technology Guidance in 2023. In January 2021, NHS Scotland adopted the NICE recommendation and recommended gammaCore for use in treatment of CH in Scotland.
NHS England awarded gammaCore a place on the Innovation Technology Payment, or ITP, program for treatment of patients with refractory (severe) cluster headache, a reimbursement pathway that opened in April 2019. Effective April 1, 2021, gammaCore was listed on the NHS England MedTech Funding Mandate (MTFM) Policy. gammaCore is still listed in the policy, which requires commissioners fund the therapy from their existing allocations.
Non-Prescription
During 2022, we launched the Truvaga product line for consumer wellness applications.
During 2022, we launched the TAC-STIM product line designed for active-duty military personnel.
Truvaga and TAC-STIM are being marketed in the United States as wellness and human performance devices pursuant to the FDA guidance document entitled “General Wellness: Policy for Low-Risk Devices; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, issued on September 27 2019”.
Manufacturing
We are the FDA-registered and ISO registered manufacturer of our nVNS products. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, located both within and outside the United States, for substantially all the components of our nVNS products. In order to protect against risk of supply chain disruption, we seek to maintain adequate inventory and have qualified an approved secondary contract manufacturer. Additionally, we retain the internal expertise and capabilities to perform all assembly aspects of our commercial product. These measures include purchasing what we consider to be a sufficient advanced supply of key components to reasonably assure that no component shortages will interrupt our ability to manufacture and deliver our products to patients on a timely basis. All the electronic components used in our products are either high-volume, non-custom commodity components, or are readily available from multiple vendors. The majority of these components have multiple sources, and the few with single sources have been purchased with sufficient reserves to permit continued production while simple product design modifications can be made. We rely upon third parties, however, for the design function for new and modified devices.
At our facility in Rockaway, NJ, we inspect inbound component parts to ensure they meet our design and manufacturing specifications prior to assembly. This quality process involves physical inspection and electrical performance testing. After successful completion of this inspection, each unit is then assembled, packaged, along with appropriate labeling and accessories.
Intellectual Property
Patents and Patent Applications
As of February 1, 2023, we held more than 200 patents and patent applications, including 128 issued U.S. patents, 37 U.S. patent applications, and 45 international patents and applications. All of our current issued patents are projected to expire between 2026 and 2037.
Copyrights, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
The software programs associated with gammaCore and our proprietary ecosystem, are protected by U.S. copyright law. 
As of February 1, 2023, our trademark portfolio consisted of six US trademark registrations, including electroCore, gammaCore, and gammaCore Sapphire, 19 international trademark registrations, and 15 pending US and international trademark applications.
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may pursue licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment or term of service.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulation
The majority of our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as by other regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the risks associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Those three classes are:

• | Class I, the lowest risk products, which require compliance with medical device general controls, including labeling, establishment registration, device product listing, adverse event reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA’s quality system regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Class II, comprising moderate-risk devices, which also require compliance with general controls and in some cases, so-called special controls that may include performance standards, particular labeling requirements, or post-market surveillance obligations; typically a Class II device also requires pre-market review and clearance by FDA of a pre-market notification (also referred to as a “510(k) application”) as well as adherence to the quality system regulations/good manufacturing practices for devices; and
• | Class III, high-risk devices that are often implantable or life-sustaining, which also require compliance with the medical device general controls and quality system regulations, but which generally must be approved by FDA before entering the market, through a more-lengthy pre-market approval (PMA) application. Approved PMAs can include post-approval conditions and post-market surveillance requirements, analogous to some of the special controls that may be imposed on Class II devices. 

Before being introduced into the U.S. market, our medical devices must obtain marketing clearance or approval from FDA through the 510(k) pre-market notification process, the de novo classification process (summarized below under De Novo Classification Process), or the PMA process, unless they are determined to be Class I devices or to otherwise qualify for an exemption from one of these available forms of pre-market review and authorization by the FDA. To date, our products have all been classified as Class II, moderate-risk medical devices and have been subject to the 510(k) review and clearance process.
Additionally, the FDA also has a policy, General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices, regarding general wellness products. Under this policy, the FDA does not intend to examine low risk general wellness products to determine whether they are devices within the meaning of the FDCA or, if they are devices, whether they comply with the relevant regulatory requirements for devices (e.g., establishment registration, pre-market review).  The policy defines general wellness products as products that meet the following two factors: (1) are intended for only general wellness use, as defined in the policy, and (2) present a low risk to the safety of users and other persons. We market Truvaga and TAC-STIM as general wellness products pursuant to this policy.
510(k) Pre-Market Notification Process
Class II devices typically require pre-market review and clearance by the FDA, which is accomplished through the submission of a 510(k) pre-market notification before the device may be marketed. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, or to a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I - this device to which the new device is compared is called the “predicate device.” In some cases, we may be required to perform clinical trials to support a claim of substantial equivalence. If clinical trials are required, we may be required to submit an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must be cleared by the FDA prior to the start of a clinical investigation, unless the device and clinical investigation are considered non-significant risk by the FDA or are exempt from the IDE requirements. Whether or not an IDE is required for a clinical study involving a medical device, an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) must review and approve the study protocol before it is initiated. It generally takes three months from the date of the pre-market notification submission to obtain a final 510(k) clearance decision from the FDA, but it can be significantly longer.
After a medical device receives a 510(k) clearance letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the new device for one or more specific indications for use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires the submission of a new 510(k) notification or could require de novo classification or a PMA. The FDA allows each company to make this determination, but the FDA can review the decision as part of routine compliance audits of the company. If the FDA disagrees with a company’s decision not to seek prior FDA authorization, the FDA may require the company to seek additional 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA also can require the company to cease marketing and/or recall the medical device in question until its regulatory status is resolved.
De Novo Classification Process
If the FDA determines that a new, previously unclassified medical device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk (in other words, they do not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a PMA because any risks associated with the device could be mitigated through general controls and/or special controls) may be eligible for the 510(k) De Novo classification process. If a product is classified as Class II through the De Novo classification process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications.
FDA has issued a Guidance document that formally codifies requirements for the medical device De Novo process and the procedures and criteria for product developers to file a De Novo classification request.
PMA Application Process
If a medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process and is not eligible for classification as a low or moderate-risk device through the De Novo process, the device is deemed to be Class III and a company must submit a PMA application to seek authorization for its commercial sale. A PMA requires more extensive pre-filing testing than is required in the 510(k) application and is more costly, lengthy and uncertain. The PMA review and approval process can take one to three years or longer, from the time the PMA application is filed with the FDA. Under a PMA, the company must demonstrate to the FDA that the new medical device is safe and effective for its intended purpose. A PMA typically includes extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device, its design, manufacture, labeling and components. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR.
If FDA approves the PMA, the approved indications may be more limited than those originally sought. In addition, FDA’s approval order may include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with the post-approval conditions can result in adverse enforcement or administrative actions, including the withdrawal of the approval. Approval of a new PMA application or a PMA supplement may be required before making certain types of modifications to the device, including to its labeling, intended use or indication, or manufacturing process, especially when such modifications have the potential to affect safety and effectiveness.
Post-Marketing Compliance Obligations
Regardless of which pre-market pathway a medical device uses to reach the U.S. market, after a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices); 
• | the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices); 
• | correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and device recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDA caused by the device that may present a risk to health; 
• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility;
• | regular and for-cause inspections by FDA to review a manufacturer’s facility and its compliance with applicable FDA requirements; and 
• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations. 
• | the guidance document entitled “General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, issued on September 27 2019” under which Truvaga and TAC-STIM are marketed under as wellness devices. 

Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data.
In 2014, we received CE Certificate of Conformity in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for our gammaCore therapy to treat, primary headache, including migraine, CH, and hemicrania continua, as well as medication overuse headache in adults. The CE Certificate of Conformity was extended to additional indications, including for the treatment or prevention of symptoms of reactive airway disease, which includes asthma, bronchoconstriction, exercise induced bronchospasm, and COPD in adults.
In the EEA and UK, gammaCore must currently comply with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to medical devices or the EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to gammaCore, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark medical devices manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the notified body would audit and examine the technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices. The notified body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.

As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the Essential Requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from () clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, () scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or () both clinical studies and scientific literature. gammaCore is a Class IIa medical device in the EU. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the competent authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent ethics committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming.
Moreover, in May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745, or MDR was adopted. The MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA Member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member states. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR became applicable on May 26, 2021, with the transition period intended to end on May 26, 2024. While progress has been made on the transition from the MDD to the MDD, a European Commission proposal published on January 6, 2023, stated that the overall number and capacity of conformity assessment (a.k.a., ‘notified’) bodies remains insufficient to carry out the tasks required of them. In addition, many manufacturers are not sufficiently prepared to meet the strengthened requirements of the MDR by the end of the transition period. This is threatening the availability of medical devices on the EU market. According to an estimation presented by notified bodies to the Medical Device Coordination Group on November 17, 2022, the number of certificates issued by May 2024 may reach around 7,000 if the current rate of certificate issuance remains the same with no changes to current conditions. Notified bodies estimate that the transition of all Directives’ certificates to MDR certificates could possibly be completed by December 2027. The European Commission’s  “Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746 as regards the transitional provisions for certain medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, Brussels, 1.6.2023 intends” to extend the transition period from May 26, 2024 until  December 31, 2027 for high-risk Class III and Class IIb implantable devices, and until  December 31, 2028 for medium and lower risk Class IIb and Class IIa devices. The gammaCore products (gammaCore Sapphire, gammaCore-S) are EU Class IIa devices. Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things: 

• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was necessary for notified bodies to be accredited by the EU Member States’ accreditation bodies to conduct assessment procedures for medical devices in accordance with the Regulation. We have the necessary certificates for the MDR.

On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, commonly referred to as Brexit. The United Kingdom and EU have agreed on the terms of the exit deal, which included a transitional period following the United Kingdom’s exit which occurred on January 31, 2020. The transitional period ended on December 31, 2020. The effects of Brexit will be determined by the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on December 24, 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on December 30, 2020 and was “provisionally” applied by the EU from December 31, 2020. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The United Kingdom's European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which can be amended or repealed. The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the EU and the United Kingdom. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what Brexit’s financial, regulatory, and legal implications will be and how it will affect us. However, potentially changing regulatory schemes and tariffs engendered by Brexit may add additional complexity, cost and delays to the operations of electroCore UK Ltd., and in marketing or selling our products in both the United Kingdom and the EEA. Our revenue and profit, supply and demand for our products, and customer retention and acquisition in both the long term and short term could be adversely affected. CE Certificates of Conformity issued by a notified body accredited in the EU may no longer be recognized in the United Kingdom. Similarly, notified bodies accredited in the United Kingdom will no longer be able to issue CE Certificates of Conformity. Obtaining new CE Certificates of Conformity or certification for the United Kingdom may have a significant impact on our activities. Finally, Brexit may also disrupt the way that the United Kingdom interprets obligations under CE Certificates of Conformity. 
Federal Trade Commission
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulatory oversight. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, or injunctions affecting the manner in which Truvaga could be marketed in the future. 
Other Regulations
We may also be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation in the jurisdictions in which we will conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, applicable anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and patient privacy and security laws and regulations.
Advertising and Promotion
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the FTC and by federal and state regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and various state attorneys general. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we may not promote our products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Other companies’ promotional activities for their FDA-regulated products have been the subject of FTC enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. FTC enforcement actions often result in consent decrees that constrain future actions. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
Import and Export Requirements
To import a device, the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). All devices are subject to FDA examination before release from CBP. Any article that appears to be in violation of the FDCA may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refuses admission, the CBP may issue a notice for redelivery and, if a company fails to redeliver the goods or otherwise satisfy CBP and the FDA with respect to their disposition, may assess liquidated damages for up to three times the value of the lot. The CBP also imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance.

Human Capital Resources
As of March 1, 2023, we employed 62 full-time employees in the US and abroad None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. Our board of directors and management oversee various employee initiatives. New employees are provided industry-relevant compliance training and are introduced to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to which all employees are required to annually confirm compliance.
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with best practices so our employees can continue to safely and effectively perform their work. For example, since the advent of the pandemic in the first half of 2020, the majority of our employees previously based in our then headquarters in Basking Ridge, NJ have generally conducted business remotely, which has allowed us to reduce our real estate space requirements.
