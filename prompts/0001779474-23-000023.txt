ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Our Company
Founded in 2008, and headquartered in Irvine, California, WM Technology, Inc. operates a leading online cannabis marketplace for consumers together with a comprehensive set of eCommerce and compliance software solutions for cannabis businesses, which are sold to both storefront locations and delivery operators (“retailers”) and brands in the United States, U.S. territories and Canadian legalized cannabis markets. Our comprehensive business-to-consumer (“B2C”) and business-to-business (“B2B”) suite of products afford cannabis retailers and brands of all sizes integrated tools to compliantly run their businesses and to reach, convert, and retain consumers. 
Our business primarily consists of our commerce-driven marketplace (“Weedmaps”), and our fully integrated suite of end-to-end Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions software offering (“Weedmaps for Business”). The Weedmaps marketplace provides cannabis consumers with information regarding cannabis retailers and brands. In addition, the Weedmaps marketplace aggregates data from a variety of sources including retailer point-of-sale solutions to provide consumers with the ability to browse by strain, price, cannabinoids and other information regarding locally available cannabis products, through our website and mobile apps. The marketplace provides consumers with product discovery, access to deals and discounts, and reservation of products for pickup by consumers or delivery to consumers by participating retailers (retailers complete orders and process payments outside of the Weedmaps marketplace as Weedmaps serves only as a portal, passing a consumer’s inquiry to the dispensary). The marketplace also provides education and learning information to help newer consumers learn about the types of products to purchase. We believe the size, loyalty and engagement of our user base and the frequency of consumption of cannabis of our user base is highly valuable to our clients and results in clients paying for our services.
Weedmaps for Business, our SaaS offering, is a comprehensive set of eCommerce and compliance software solutions catered towards cannabis retailers, delivery services and brands that streamline front and back-end operations and help manage compliance needs. These tools support cannabis businesses at every stage in the consumer funnel, enabling them to:
•Strategically reach prospective cannabis consumers;
•Manage pickup, delivery and inventory in compliance with local regulations;
•Help improve the customer experience by creating online browsing and ordering functionality on a brand or retailer (including delivery) operator’s website and by extending that functionality in-store with kiosks;
•Foster customer loyalty and re-engage with segments of consumers;
•Leverage the Weedmaps for Business products in conjunction with any other preferred software solutions via integrations and application programming interfaces (“APIs”); and
•Make informed marketing and merchandising decisions using performance analytics and consumer and brand insights to promote products to specific consumer groups.
We offer this functionality through a packaged software solution that includes (based on availability within any given market and state-level regulations) (i) a listing page with product menu on weedmaps.com, our iOS Weedmaps mobile application and our Android Weedmaps mobile application, which allows clients to disclose their license information, hours of operation, contact information, discount policies and other information that may be required under applicable state law, (ii) the ability to receive reservations of products for pickup by consumers or delivery to consumers (either on weedmaps.com, on a white labeled WM Store website or third-party websites through our orders and menu embed product), (iii) a customizable menus for brands, retailers and delivery operators to embed on their website, (iv) access to our APIs, including real-time connectivity between Weedmaps for Business to a point-of-sale system (“POS”) to streamline workflows and promote compliance through accuracy and (v) analytics dashboards. We also offer add-on and a la carte products and services for additional fees, including advertising and customer relationship management (“CRM”) software, among other things (see below for a description of these services). Finally, we offer a growing set of offerings for brands to reach consumers and retailers as well as manage their brand catalog information.
The state-legal cannabis industry in the United States has grown consistently in recent years was estimated to be between approximately $25-$30 billion in 2022, according to Wall Street analyst estimates, and by some estimates is expected to be in excess of $70 billion by 2030, assuming a continued pace of new state legalization, with 68%1 of U.S. adults since 2020 in support of having legal access to cannabis. Currently, thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana have legalized some form of cannabis use for certain medical purposes. Twenty-one of those states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Northern Mariana have legalized cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes

as well (sometimes referred to as adult or recreational use). Nine additional states have legalized forms of low-potency cannabis, for select medical conditions. Only three states continue to prohibit cannabis entirely. Despite expectations of growth, the regulated cannabis market in the United States is still nascent and fragmented, with significant challenges facing both consumers seeking to understand cannabis and find the right products for them and businesses seeking to operate compliantly and to effectively reach and market to cannabis consumers. Cannabis users (as defined by adults who have consumed cannabis in the past year) within the United States represent less than 19% of the U.S. adult, ages 21 and above, population today2 (and less than 14% for those that consumed in the past month)2. On the client side, as of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 10,800 retail licenses across the United States with medical and/or adult-use regulations in place, which is an effective retail density of approximately one retail license per 22,470 residents across these markets in the aggregate, based on data available from individual governmental cannabis license databases and the U.S. Census Bureau estimates for both licenses and population.
In addition to these nascent consumer and business dynamics, cannabis itself is a highly complex, regulated and diverse, non-shelf stable consumer good that spans hundreds of strains and a growing set of form factors available for consumption, including flower, pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, tinctures and concentrates. Despite these complexities, consumers still expect the same product information, discovery and comparison options across multiple channels from cannabis businesses that they expect from other retailers or brands. These consumer expectations, coupled with the lack of normalized product information in the industry, in addition to the unique attributes of cannabis as a nascent and highly regulated consumer product, create significant challenges for retailers and brands who serve cannabis consumers. Retailers and brands must meet these consumer expectations and provide omni-channel engagement opportunities with the same (i) level of service, (ii) richness of product information, (iii) ability to compare prices, and (iv) ease of product and brand discovery that consumers would receive when researching other consumer product categories. Further, brands are limited in their ability to market and sell directly and need to find ways to communicate to consumers. At the same time, these businesses must comply with a rapidly evolving legal and regulatory landscape that differs by state and across cities and counties within each state, creating challenges in the ability to scale in a capital-efficient way.
Our Product and Solution Ecosystem
Our solutions are designed to address these challenges facing cannabis consumers and businesses. The Weedmaps marketplace allows cannabis users to search for and browse cannabis products from retailers and brands, and ultimately reserve products from certain local retailers, in a manner similar to other technology platforms with breadth and depth of product, brand and retailer selection. With the development of Weedmaps for Business, we offer an end-to-end platform for licensed cannabis

retailers to comply with state law. We sell a monthly subscription offering to storefront, delivery and brand clients as well as upsell and add-on offerings to licensed clients. Our current subscription package includes: 
•WM Listings: A listing page with product menu for a retailer or brand on the Weedmaps marketplace, enabling our clients to be discovered by the marketplace’s users. This also allows clients to disclose their license information, hours of operation, contact information, discount policies and other information that may be required under applicable state law;
•WM Orders: Software for retailers to receive pickup and delivery orders directly from a Weedmaps listing and connect orders directly with a client’s POS system (for certain POS systems). The marketplace also enables brands to route customer purchase interest to a retailer that carries the brand’s product. After a dispensary receives the order request from the consumer, the dispensary and the consumer can continue to communicate, adjust items in the request, and handle any stock issues, prior to and while the dispensary processes and fulfills the order;
•WM Store: Customizable orders and menu embed, which allows retailers and brands to import their Weedmaps listing menu or product reservation functionality to their own white-labeled WM Store website or separately owned website. WM Store facilitates customer pickup or delivery orders and enables retailers to reach more customers by bringing the breadth of the Weedmaps marketplace to a client’s own website;
•WM Connectors: A centralized integration platform, including API tools, for easier menu management, automatic inventory updates and streamlined order fulfillment to enable clients to save time and more easily integrate into the WM Technology ecosystem and integrate with disparate software systems. This creates business efficiencies and improves the accuracy and timeliness of information across Weedmaps, creating a more positive experience for consumers and businesses; and
•WM Insights: An insights and analytics platform for clients leveraging data across the Weedmaps marketplace and software solutions. WM Insights provides data and analytics on user engagement and traffic trends to a client’s listing page. For Brand clients, WM Insights allows them to monitor their brand and product rankings, identify retailers not carrying products and keep track of top brands and products by category and state.
 We also offer other add-on products for additional fees, including:
•WM Ads: Ad solutions on the Weedmaps marketplace designed for clients to amplify their businesses and reach more highly engaged cannabis consumers throughout their buying journey including:
◦Featured Listings: Premium placement ad solutions on high visibility locations on the Weedmaps marketplace (desktop and mobile) to amplify our clients’ businesses and maximize clients’ listings and deal presence 
◦WM Deals: Discount and promotion pricing tools that let clients strategically reach prospective price-conscious cannabis customers with deals or discounts to drive conversion. In some jurisdictions, it is required by applicable law to showcase discounts)

•WM AdSuite: Omni-channel (on and off platform) marketing solution with access to the Weedmaps marketplace and cannabis-friendly off marketplace outlets including certain publishers, out-of-home units in addition to other media solutions. These campaigns leverage proprietary first-party Weedmaps data to target verified cannabis consumers; 
•WM CRM: Customer relationship management software allowing clients to reach new consumers, build loyalty, and grow revenue with our compliant app, text and marketing tools. The tools also allow for retargeting and re-engagement of cannabis consumers;
•WM Dispatch: Compliant, automated and optimized logistics and fulfillment last-mile delivery software (including driver apps) that helps clients manage their delivery fleets. This product streamlines the delivery experience from in-store to front-door; and
•WM Screens: In-store digital menu signage and kiosk solution and media management tool enabling clients to enhance the in-store experience, impact omnichannel retail and centralize operations with revenue-driving and customizable digital signage. 
We charge a monthly fee to retailer, delivery and brand clients for access to our subscription package, which includes WM Listings, WM Orders, WM Store, WM Connectors and WM Insights. Depending on the market, the other add-on products are available for additional fees.
We sell our Weedmaps for Business suite in the United States, currently offer some of our Weedmaps for Business solutions in Canada and have a limited number of non-monetized listings in several other countries including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. We operate in the United States, Canada and other foreign jurisdictions where medical and/or adult cannabis use is legal under state or national law. As of December 31, 2022, we actively operated in over 30 U.S. states and territories that have adult-use and/or medical-use regulations in place. We define actively operated markets as those U.S. states or territories with greater than $1,000 monthly revenue.
Our mission is to power a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy. Our technology addresses the challenges facing both consumers seeking to understand cannabis products and businesses who serve cannabis users in a legally compliant fashion. Over the past 14 years, Weedmaps has become a premier destination for cannabis consumers to discover and browse information regarding cannabis and cannabis products, permitting product discovery and order-ahead for pickup or delivery by participating retailers. Weedmaps for Business is a set of eCommerce-enablement tools designed to help retailers and brands get the best out of the Weedmaps’ consumer experience, create labor efficiencies and manage compliance needs.
We hold a strong belief in the importance of enabling safe, legal access to cannabis for consumers worldwide. We believe we offer the only comprehensive software platform that allows cannabis retailers to reach their target audience, quickly and cost effectively, addressing a wide range of needs. We are committed to building the software solutions that power cannabis businesses compliantly in the industry, to advocating for legalization, licensing and social equity of cannabis and to facilitating further learning through partnership with subject matter experts to provide detailed, accurate information about cannabis. 
As we continue to expand the presence and increase the number of consumers on the Weedmaps marketplace and broaden our offerings, we generate more value for our business clients. As we continue to expand the presence and increase the number of cannabis businesses listed on weedmaps.com, we become a more compelling marketplace for consumers. To capitalize on the growth opportunities of our two-sided marketplace and solutions, we plan to continue making investments in raising brand awareness, increasing penetration within existing markets and expanding to new markets, as well as continuing to develop and monetize new solutions to extend the functionality of our platform. These investments serve to deepen the consumer experience with our platform and continue to provide a high level of support to our business clients.
While the cannabis industry is still in the early innings of what could be decades of growth, we have established a leading position and a recognized brand given our 14-year operating history. Over the coming years, we plan to continue expanding our solutions and service offerings.
Challenges in Our End-Markets
Despite cannabis being a large and growing sector in the United States, we believe that cannabis is unlike many other consumer goods and retail categories for a number of reasons:
•Cannabis as a regulated industry is still in a nascent stage of development.
•Cannabis users (as defined as adults, ages 21 and above, who have consumed cannabis in the past year) are less than 19% of the U.S. adult, ages 21 and above, population today3 (and less than 14% for those that consumed in the past month) without a “typical” user profile. 
•Regulations governing cannabis are complex and vary state-by-state and by city and county within states. 
•Cannabis has wide variance in characteristics that make it complex for consumers to make an informed purchase decision.
•Cannabis is a perishable good with a lack of product homogeneity. 
•Brands are only in the early innings of establishing a consumer presence. 
•Competition with the illicit market is still an issue, particularly in states like California. 
•The industry has experienced periods of price deflation, including over the past year, impacting the financial performance of businesses across the value chain.
•Limited access to capital (relative to other industries) and limitations under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) on deduction or credit for certain expenses of cannabis business can reduce the cash flow and liquidity of many industry participants.

Our Competitive Strengths
Since our founding in 2008, we have grown to become a leading provider of technology solutions to the cannabis industry by leveraging our competitive strengths, including:
•Long History as a Technology Leader Serving the Cannabis Industry. Founded in 2008, we have a long history and established relationships with cannabis businesses and consumers across the United States. This has given us several competitive strengths, such as scale, attractive operating margins and local insights into emerging consumer and business trends across many markets. Our policy expertise allows us to anticipate and react quickly to changes in cannabis regulations and informs all aspects of our business, including our product ideation, development and go-to-market strategies.
•Largest Two-Sided Platform for Cannabis Businesses and Consumers. With $215.5 million in revenue and 5,457 average monthly paying clients for the year ended December 31, 2022, we believe we are the largest two sided platform for cannabis businesses and consumers in the United States. As we increase the number of users on our platform, we generate more engagements and can more easily persuade our business clients to consolidate their service providers by switching to our value-priced Weedmaps for Business bundled solution. As we continue to increase the number of businesses on our marketplace, we become a more compelling platform for users. As more businesses and users join the platform, we gain a richer trove of industry data to perform market research and assist in product development and improvement. The result is a self-reinforcing, mutually beneficial, two-sided network effect, which we believe is difficult to replicate.
•A Fully-Integrated Business-in-a-Box SaaS Solution Specific to the Cannabis Industry. We believe our Weedmaps for Business is the industry’s only comprehensive business-in-a-box solution and incorporates embedded compliance functionality so that our clients comply with state law through integrated software solutions ranging from live menus, logistics and fulfillment, CRM, POS integrations, inventory management and data and analytics. We believe we are the only platform servicing cannabis that combines both a scaled marketplace and software - most other technology providers offer software solutions without the marketplace or marketplace without software. We believe we offer the most comprehensive software platform that allows cannabis retailers to reach their target audience, quickly and cost effectively, addressing a wide range of needs. Our platform also features self-service administrative functionality that enables clients to manage their listings page, including adding images, adjusting their menus, editing product information and responding to reviews as well as analyzing traffic trends.
•Unique and Growing Data Asset. Given our established presence, scale and the breadth of product offerings that provide us with a high volume of retail-level information and user insights, we have a growing and unique first-party data asset. Currently, the cannabis industry has few reliable sources of fulsome datasets. Our data gives us insights on local market trends and the shape of the consumer journey from exploration and discovery to point of direct interaction with retailers across multiple retailers, brands and products. As our network of clients and consumers continues to grow, our data set will become deeper and richer, increasing its value and our potential monetization opportunities.
•Ability to Innovate Rapidly and Launch New Products Efficiently at Scale. We have an agile product innovation and deployment process. Our sales team frequently engages with our paid clients about the products they use, as well as their business objectives and performance. We constantly strive to generate product ideas through this deep engagement with our clients, as well as empirical research. During the initial development phases, we test a proposed offering with relevant areas of our business such as sales, policy, compliance, legal, marketing and technology, and use the resulting cross-functional input to develop a clear business rationale and explicit articulation of the goals, client problems that need to be solved, compliance features that need to be incorporated, and potential product-market fit prior to the investment of developer time and company resources. We leverage reusable microservices architecture and modular technology that can be redeployed across multiple new offerings for quicker development cycles. This streamlined approach yields smaller initiatives requiring less investment, enabling us to deliver cost-effective product innovation at a rapid pace.
•Capital-Efficient Business Model with Historical Track Record of Positive Cash Flows. We operate a cloud-based platform, and unlike other cannabis-related businesses, we require minimal physical footprint and are not directly exposed to fluctuations in product input costs. We do not require real estate or other significant capital outlays to enter new markets. Our offerings can be efficiently customized to new markets to facilitate expansion, which provides significant flexibility to scale and enter new markets with minimal investment. The capital-efficiency of our business model is evidenced by our historical robust margin profile and, prior to 2022, our track record of positive Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows (cash flows defined as operating cash flows less capital expenditures).
•Operationally-Focused Management Team with Deep Experience. Our executive leadership team has extensive and relevant professional experience spanning the technology, consumer, retail, legal and financial services industries, with a track record of operational execution and driving growth. Our Executive Chair and Principal Executive Officer, Douglas Francis is a co-founder of WM Technology and prior to 2019, had served as its Chief Executive Officer. We 
believe our deep knowledge of our end-markets and broad-based operational expertise spanning several industry sectors provides a key competitive advantage in executing against our growth strategy.
Our Growth Strategy
As a leading marketplace and software platform, our goal is not only to grow our market share but to grow the entire market by influencing policy promoting wider access to licensed cannabis, educating consumers on how to shop for cannabis and providing licensed operators with the tools they need to access users and grow their businesses. Given our share of cannabis businesses, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on underlying growth across our end-markets by executing against our strategy as follows:
•Grow Our Two-Sided Marketplace. Our goal is to be the center of commerce for consumers seeking cannabis. To support this goal, we intend to continue growing the number of consumers on our platform through original content that educates, entertains, facilitates discovery of new products, increases awareness of our platform and encourages repeat usage. As we grow our users and user engagements, we will continue to engage with our clients to demonstrate the value we believe they receive on our platform and can convince more businesses to increase adoption of our Weedmaps for Business services through our Weedmaps for Business subscription offering and additional add-ons.
•Expand Our Existing Markets and Enter New Markets. We have a significant opportunity to grow our client base both within existing markets that are continuing to grow and new markets as they become open to regulated cannabis. We are increasingly becoming a more nationally-recognized brand, and we are monetizing our platform in over 30 U.S. states and territories, as of December 31, 2022. Based on our internal research, we believe the minimum level of acceptable retail density to have a healthy and functioning licensed market is a minimum of one licensed retailer per 10,000 residents. Many of the U.S. states where we operate today are still under-penetrated with low levels of licensed retail density.
•
We believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for us within our existing markets as retail licenses continue to be issued, and states move towards, and eventually beyond, the one retail license per 10,000 people ratio. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 10,800 existing retail and delivery licenses across the United States. Assuming no cap on the number of licenses issued or other restrictions on the number of licenses issued, if these same markets were to issue enough licenses to match a ratio of one license per 10,000 residents, over 22,000 new retail licenses would be issued. This may require continued liberalization of license restrictions across cities and counties within certain of our states where we do business today. With continued state legalization (since 2020, states where recreational usage has been legalized include New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Missouri and Maryland), we believe that legalization by additional states and eventually the U.S. government is inevitable. Assuming no other restrictions on the number of licenses issued, if the entire United States reached a minimum level of density of one license per 10,000 residents, we believe the total universe of retail licenses would reach approximately 33,000, which is approximately 3.1 times the current count of retail licenses in the United States and Canada. If our assumptions and projections are correct, this represents a significant growth opportunity for us as every new retail license issued is an opportunity to onboard a new client onto our platform and increase their monthly spend as they leverage more of our services, solutions and upsell / add-on products.
•Expand Our Weedmaps for Business Solutions and Monetize Gross Merchandise Value (“GMV”) Consistent with Federal and State Laws. We intend to continue expanding our suite of valuable advertising and software solutions and the functionality of our Weedmaps for Business solutions through additional offerings of premium analytics, CRM and loyalty tools, among other solutions, which we intend to monetize through additional higher priced tiers within our subscription offering. We will continue to expand the availability of our POS integrations across additional states. We also are continuously improving the base-level functionality across our Weedmaps for Business solutions. We believe these initiatives will result in a more engaged client who utilizes more of our services across our platform and is more ripe for monetization opportunities over time. While we do not believe GMV is a driver of our revenue currently, GMV could represent significant monetization potential over time when and if U.S. federal regulations allow us to monetize our clients’ currently off-platform transaction activity through take-rates or payment fees.
•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We take a measured approach to acquisition-related growth. We intend to continue selectively pursuing opportunities to invest in and acquire technology offerings that either complement our existing products and services or allow us to accelerate our growth.
Competition
Our direct competitors for individual components or parts of our platform include cannabis-focused, technology companies like Leafly, Dutchie and Jane Technologies, SpringBig (CRM) and a variety of cannabis-focused marketing and advertising technology solutions. In addition, for our retail listing pages, our platform may also compete with current or potential products and solutions offered by internet search engines and advertising networks like Google, Yelp, various other newspaper, television and media companies, as well as outdoor billboard advertising. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the scale of our network, comprehensiveness of offerings, ease of adoption and use and ability to facilitate compliance with the complex, disparate regulations applicable to businesses operating in the cannabis industry, breadth and trustworthiness of information available to consumers and brand. We believe we compete favorably based on these factors.
For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section entitled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We currently face intense competition in the market and we expect competition to further intensify as the cannabis industry continues to evolve.”
Sales and Marketing
Sales
Our sales team is primarily based out of our Irvine, California headquarters. Members of our sales team are knowledgeable about the products and add-ons that we offer, such as our Deals platform or WM Orders, and assist new and existing clients with our platform.
We generate many leads for new listing pages through the applicable state cannabis regulators’ lists of licensees. Other leads are created from inbound requests by applicants for cannabis licenses to begin establishing their business’ presence on our platform pending an expected cannabis license.
Marketing
We believe the quality and strength of our platform is our most valuable marketing asset. Our marketing strategy, across both consumers and businesses, consists of user acquisition, brand marketing, communications and field marketing.
Our consumer marketing efforts focus on driving awareness of the platform, acquiring new users who may be interested in the platform and increasing engagement of existing users. To augment the engagement of our platform, we employ a series of lifecycle marketing, social media and SEO tactics to increase our direct & organic traffic. Though many traditional paid marketing channels (such as broadcast television or Google search and display ads) are not available to platforms in the cannabis industry, we have been able to build a reliable network of online tactics that allow us to accelerate the growth of our consumer base at very competitive customer acquisition costs. Additionally, we seek key broad consumer opportunities to cement our place in consumers’ minds as the premier cannabis marketplace such as our February 2022 “Brock Ollie” digital spot around the Super Bowl in order to raise awareness around the ongoing marketing restrictions for cannabis businesses, our April 2022 Tumbleweeds with Killer Mike series and our partnership on the June 2022 music video - “Taste So Good”. 
Our business marketing focus is to drive awareness of the value and breadth of our offering among cannabis retailers and brands. We do so through direct physical and digital marketing, working with local cannabis business associations, and through lifecycle marketing with existing clients. Given the strength of our brand, we have seen strength in performance of our tactics in what is a crowded market, easing the acquisition or upsell process for our sales team.
Social Impact
To support the growth of an inclusive cannabis industry, we participate in policy panels and organize educational sessions to educate attendees about the importance of social equity programs and other policy initiatives that are designed to ensure the ability of people of color and those impacted by the war on drugs to participate in the legal cannabis markets that are opening (i.e. social equity licensing programs). We have drafted white papers and mock legislative provisions that were designed to support the enactment of social equity licensing programs and advocates for state and local governments to enact social equity licensing programs. We have established a program, WM Teal, which stands for “Together for Equity Access and Legislation”, through which we provide free software, advertising, educational materials and training programs to applicants or licenses under social equity licensing programs.
Product Development
Our product development efforts focus on adding new features and solutions to our platform, as well as increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our platform. While we expect product development costs to increase as we continue to increase the functionality of our platform, we expect our product development costs to remain the same percentage of total revenues.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are valuable assets that are important to our business. In our efforts to safeguard our copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property rights worldwide, we rely on a combination of federal, state, common law and international rights in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names, taglines and logos in the United States, Canada, the European Union and other jurisdictions to the extent we determine they are appropriate and cost-effective.
As of December 31, 2022, we have been issued trademark registrations in the United States, Canada, Japan, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Australia. We have also been issued an international trademark registration with designation in Australia and the European Union for “Weedmaps.” As of December 31, 2022, we have pending trademark applications in the United States covering: “WM TECH” and “WM TECHNOLOGY”, as well as a pending trademark application in the United States covering “Weedmaps” for delivery platform services. We also have pending trademark applications in Canada covering “Weedmaps”.
In addition to our numerous trademark applications and registrations, we have United States copyright registrations for our weedmaps.com website, “Grow One,” and two versions of our Lab API documentation. Further, we own several domain names, including: weedmaps.com, marijuana.com, cannabis.com, wmpolicy.com, themuseumofweed.com, wm-retail.com, wmforbusiness.com and WM.store. Our trademarks and domain names are material to our business and brand identity.
We also rely on non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, or license agreements with employees, independent contractors, consumers, software providers and other third parties, which protect and limit access to and use of our proprietary intellectual property.
Though we rely, in part, upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees, as well as the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
People Operations and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 580 full-time employees and 3 temporary employees, including 224 in engineering, product and design, 245 in sales and marketing and 114 in general and administrative. Of these employees, 573 are located in the United States and 10 are located in Canada.
We believe that being able to attract and retain top talent is both a strategic advantage for us and necessary to realize our mission of powering a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy. Our position as a leading technology provider to the cannabis industry helps us attract high caliber employees who are technologically skilled and also passionate about our mission and products. We devote substantial resources to this task. Our dedicated, best-in-class Talent Acquisition team is focused on finding and attracting diverse and capable talent, and our People & Culture team is set on building a world class employer of choice for that talent once they get here. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Government Regulation
Numerous countries and territories have moved in recent years to regulate and tax cannabis, particularly medical cannabis. Most of these jurisdictions present complex regulatory regimes that require licensed operators to comply with substantial reporting, testing, packaging, distribution and security requirements.
United States and Territories
Notwithstanding the trend toward further state legalization, the U.S. government continues to categorize cannabis as an illegal Schedule I controlled substance, and accordingly the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, advertisement of sale and possession by our customers violate federal law, as discussed further in the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.”
While the Obama and Trump administrations had different stated policies, including the latter’s less friendly position on the industry, the U.S. federal government has not prioritized the enforcement of the CSA’s prohibition on cannabis against cannabis companies complying with the state law and their vendors for over eight years. On January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the “Sessions Memo”) rescinding certain past Department of Justice (“DOJ”) memoranda on cannabis law enforcement, including the Memorandum by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole (the “Cole Memo”) issued on August 29, 2013, under the Obama administration. 
Describing the criminal enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions against those complying with state cannabis regulatory systems as an inefficient use of federal investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memo gave federal prosecutors discretion not to prosecute state law compliant cannabis companies in states that were regulating cannabis, unless one or more of eight federal priorities were implicated, including use of cannabis by minors, violence, or the use of federal lands for cultivation. The Sessions Memo, which remains in effect, states that each U.S. Attorney’s Office should follow established principles that govern all federal prosecutions when deciding which cannabis activities to prosecute.
Since 2014, versions of the U.S. omnibus spending bill have included a provision prohibiting the DOJ, which includes the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. Federal courts have held that the provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds to prosecute individuals who engage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws.
During his campaign, President Biden promised federal reform on cannabis, including decriminalization generally. In 2022, President Biden signed into law the “Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act,” a bill aimed at easing restrictions on cannabis research -- bipartisan legislation which is the first standalone cannabis reform bill to pass both the House and Senate. Additionally, on October 6, 2022, President Biden issued a presidential proclamation pardoning federal convictions for simple marijuana possession offenses, encouraging state governors to do the same on the state level where permissible, and requesting that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General initiate an administrative process to review cannabis’s Schedule I classification under the CSA. This process could, but is not guaranteed to, change the legal status of cannabis on a federal level. Regardless of the ultimate outcome on CSA scheduling, both actions represent significant milestones in the evolution of federal cannabis policy. 
Although the U.S. Attorney General, Merrick Garland, is expected to issue policy guidance to federal prosecutors that they should not interfere with cannabis businesses operating in compliance with states’ laws, any such guidance would not have the force of law, and could not be enforced by the courts. During his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate, Judge Garland testified that prosecuting state-legal cannabis companies would not be a “useful use of limited resources.” In April, 2022, Attorney General Garland reiterated that prosecuting the possession of cannabis is “not an efficient use” of federal resources, especially “given the ongoing opioid and methamphetamine epidemic[s]” facing the nation. As recently as March 1, 2023, Attorney General Garland confirmed that his Department is continuing work on a new cannabis enforcement guidance, which he states would be “very close to what was done in the Cole memorandum.” Therefore, the status quo of federal non-enforcement is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, though of course that is not certain.
Members of the U.S. Congress from both parties have introduced bills to end the federal cannabis prohibition, by de-scheduling cannabis completely and regulating it. In the 117th Congress, Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) filed the Cannabis Administration And Opportunity Act, a bill that would regulate cannabis and expunge prior cannabis convictions; and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) filed the States Reform Act, which would repeal the federal prohibition of and further regulate cannabis on the federal level. This session has seen additional incremental reform bills, including a bill that would direct the Attorney General of the United States to amend the CSA to move cannabis from schedule I to schedule III of the Act (the “Marijuana 1 to 3 Act”), and a bill to allow medical cannabis patients to purchase and possess firearms (the “Second Amendment Protection Act”). While the timing of federal reform remains unknown, it is expected that federal policy on cannabis will continue becoming more, rather than less, permissive and legislative efforts to legalize cannabis or cannabis banking at the national level are likely to continue in 2023.
Some of our retail clients sell products with CBD derived from hemp with and without THC from non-hemp cannabis. In December 2018, the U.S. government removed hemp and extracts of hemp, including CBD, from the CSA schedules through the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-334 (the “2018 Farm Bill”). Accordingly, the production, sale and possession of hemp or extracts of hemp, including certain CBD products, no longer violate the CSA. The states have implemented a patchwork of different laws on hemp and its extracts, including CBD. Additionally, the Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) claims that the Food, Drugs & Cosmetics Act significantly limits the legality of certain hemp-derived CBD products. In January 2023, FDA affirmed that the agency will not compromise—or create new standards—in evaluating or permitting cannabis or cannabinoid compounds and products, and particularly cannabidiol (“CBD”), indicating that Congress must take action to end the stalemate between federal and state laws and the purgatory of FDA selective enforcement. While enforcement regarding hemp-derived products has generally been limited, changes in enforcement priorities or further federal regulations could negatively impact our clients that sell such products, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation.
We have been neither a defendant in a criminal action nor the subject of a civil or regulatory enforcement proceeding, prosecuted by a U.S. governmental authority based on our provision of products and solutions to the cannabis industry. Furthermore, we believe that Section 230 provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability to internet service provider intermediaries in the United States, such as us, for content provided on their platforms that they did not create or develop. We do not create or develop the information that appears on our clients’ listing pages and other advertising placements, although 
our moderation teams may take down a client’s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). We do author and edit certain original content that appears in other sections of our website, such as WM News, WM Learn and WM Policy. All of these sections are general news and information, and none of these sections are advertisements for, or listing pages of, cannabis businesses. For additional information about Section 230, see the sections entitled “Business—Overview” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.” 
Our clients are subject to licensing and related requirements under applicable laws and regulations, and our own compliance policies, and some of our clients currently and in the future may not be in compliance with all such requirements. Currently, we require all cannabis retailers on Weedmaps to display a valid, unexpired state-issued license number on their listing. We have a dedicated Policy & Compliance Operations team that reviews license information, both on submission and on an ongoing basis, to ensure validity and accuracy. For certain Weedmaps products or services, we may request additional verification and documentation. Additionally, we require contractual representations and warranties from our clients that they are complying with state law. If, despite our policies to verify state-licensure, unlicensed or noncompliant businesses are able to access our products, it could subject us to legal or regulatory enforcement and negative publicity, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, brand and reputation.

Canada
Medical cannabis has been legal in Canada since 1999 through various regulatory regimes. On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act (Canada) came into force. The Cannabis Act governs both the medical and the regulated adult-use markets in Canada. Prior to October 17, 2018, legal access to and use of medical cannabis in Canada was regulated under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the associated Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”). Under the Cannabis Act, holders of licenses to cultivate and/or process cannabis are also permitted to supply cannabis under their existing licenses obtained pursuant to the ACMPR to the regulated adult-use market.
The distribution and sale of cannabis for adult use is regulated separately by each provincial and territorial government, and as such, regulatory regimes vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In each of the provinces and territories, except for Saskatchewan, a provincial distributor is responsible for purchasing cannabis from producers and selling products to its regulated retail distribution channels. In addition, in certain provinces and territories, the provincial distributor is solely responsible for online sales. With respect to retail sales of cannabis, other than online sales, the certain provincial and territorial regulations allow only for government-run cannabis stores, while the provincial and territorial regulations in other jurisdictions leave the retail sale of cannabis, other than online sales, to the private sector. Other provincial and territorial regulations allow for a hybrid model in which both public and private stores can operate.
The regulations promulgated under the Cannabis Act (“the Cannabis Regulations”), provide more detail on the medical and adult-use regulatory regimes for cannabis, including regarding licensing, security clearances and physical security requirements, product practices, outdoor growing, security, packaging and labeling, cannabis-containing compounds, document retention requirements, reporting and disclosure requirements and new access to cannabis for medical purposes regime and industrial hemp regulations. Under the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations, Health Canada has been granted the authority to issue a wide range of licenses, including licenses for standard cultivation, micro-cultivation, industrial hemp cultivation and nursery cultivation, licenses for standard processing and micro-processing and sales licenses.
The Cannabis Act prohibits all cannabis promotion unless specifically authorized thereunder. Under Subsection 17(1) of the Cannabis Act, it is prohibited to promote cannabis or a cannabis accessory or any service related to cannabis, including (a) by communicating information about its price or distribution; (b) by doing so in a manner that there are reasonable grounds to believe could be appealing to young persons; (c) by means of a testimonial or endorsement, however displayed or communicated; (d) by means of the depiction of a person, character or animal, whether real or fictional; or (e) by presenting it or any of its brand elements in a manner that associates it or the brand element with, or evokes a positive or negative emotion about or image of, a way of life such as one that includes glamour, recreation, excitement, vitality, risk or daring.
Authorized promotions under the Cannabis Act include those by licensed businesses and others, limited to informational content or brand preference promotion. Informational promotion is promotion that contains factual information to the consumer about cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabis, including their availability and price. Brand-preference promotion is promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabis based on their brand characteristics. Businesses that are authorized to produce, sell or distribute cannabis under the Cannabis Act may promote cannabis by means of an informational promotion or brand preference promotion so long as the person responsible for the promotion, if a telecommunication, has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the promotion cannot be accessed by a young person.
As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that Section 230 provides immunity from civil and state criminal liability to internet service provider intermediaries in the United States, such as us, for content provided on their platforms that they did not create or develop. While Article 19.17.2 of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), which became effective on July 1, 2020, contains language which is similar to Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act, there is currently no statutory equivalent to Section 230 in Canada. While the case law in Canada on this point is not extensive, however, we believe that courts in Canada have tended to exclude digital platforms in Canada, such as us, from aiding-and-abetting liability for publishing third-party content on their platforms where the platform providers act as “mere conduits” for the content. For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry.” We do not create or develop the information that appears in our clients’ listing pages and other advertising placements, although our moderation teams may take down a client’s information if it breaches our listing restrictions or admonish consumers who post reviews that violate our community terms of use (which, for example, prohibit profanity and racism). For additional information about content, see the section entitled “—Government Regulations— United States and Territories.”
Rest of the World
Legalized cannabis is expanding in other parts of the world with countries adopting varying degrees of legalization or decriminalization. We do not yet regard these countries as viable marketplaces for our products, though we have ongoing tests of a small number of listings in several markets where that product is legally permissible.
