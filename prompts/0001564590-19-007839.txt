Overview
 
We are a neurotechnology company focused on neurological wellness. Our purpose is to develop, license or acquire non-invasive technologies targeted at reducing symptoms of neurological disease or trauma.
 Our first product, the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator, or PoNS™, is an authorized medical device in Canada for the treatment of chronic balance deficit associated with a mild to moderate traumatic brain injury, or mmTBI, and is an  investigational, non-invasive, medical device for which we have submitted an application for marketing authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and for a CE mark in the European Union, or EU, to improve balance in patients following a mmTBI. Our PoNS device, when combined with targeted physical and/or cognitive therapy, or the PoNS Treatment, is the first and only patented treatment that combines neurostimulation of cranial nerves via the tongue to restore lost function.
 
On December 21, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary NeuroHabilitation Corporation, or NHC, changed its name to Helius Medical, Inc, or HMI. On January 31, 2019, we formed another wholly owned subsidiary, Helius NeuroRehab, Inc., or HNR, a Delaware corporation, which will operate a clinical research site as well as a rehabilitation clinic that will provide the PoNS Treatment to patients with balance and gait disorder following our receipt of marketing authorization from the FDA.
 
Overview of mmTBI and Current Available Treatments
 
There are an estimated 14.5 million people globally, with over 1.5 million in the United States and 350,000 in Canada, living with chronic balance deficit due to mmTBI. Every year in Canada and the United States there are approximately 20,000 and 420,000 newly diagnosed mmTBIs, respectively, resulting in chronic balance deficit. This condition often has a significant impact on one’s quality of life, negatively affecting independence, employability, productivity, mental health and participation in the community. Following a brain injury, people often require rehabilitation for associated motor, cognitive and behavioral impairments and may work with a multi-disciplinary team of rehabilitation professionals. The current standard of care to address balance issues following a mmTBI is physical therapy. While physical therapy can help to promote balance recovery, individuals are often unable to return to their full function and are left living with a chronic balance deficit.  
 
Prior to the development of the PoNS device, there were no treatments available that were clinically proven and indicated to treat long-term balance issues. A few studies have suggested that physical therapy aimed at improving balance and gait may be mildly effective for rehabilitation in the mmTBI population. However, to our knowledge, no mid-to-late stage clinical studies have reported improvements in function of the magnitude that would be considered evidence of systematic recovery of normal function, nor have any studies proven that physical therapy alone has a lasting effect on balance and gait. Given the small number of published studies, the small number of patients enrolled in the studies of which we are aware, the varying range of interventional protocols employed in such studies and the lower levels of study design, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness and dosing parameters of using physical therapy alone to treat the many people who live with chronic balance problems after an mmTBI. Consequently, we believe that there is a large potential commercial opportunity for the PoNS Treatment in the treatment of chronic balance deficit due to mmTBI. Our goal is to establish the PoNS Treatment as the standard of care for this condition all over the world. 
 
PoNS Treatment
 The PoNS Treatment consists of an investigational medical device (comprised of an electric pulse generator and a replaceable mouthpiece) delivering neurostimulation combined with targeted physical and/or cognitive therapy. Neurostimulation is delivered through specially patterned electrical stimulation developed to deliver nerve impulses to the brain through 143 gold-plated electrodes on the mouthpiece, which is placed on the tongue. The PoNS Treatment consists of  20-minute sessions of electrical stimulation through the tongue, called translingual neurostimulation, coupled with targeted physical and/or cognitive therapy consisting of condition specific exercises for movement control, balance and gait training, and breathing and awareness training that are designed to focus on the individual patient’s functional deficits. Clinical research has shown that translingual neurostimulation activates two major cranial nerves – the lingual nerve, a part of the trigeminal nerve, and the chorda tympani, a part of the facial nerve. Electrical stimulation of the cranial nerves creates a flow of neural impulses that are then delivered directly into the brain stem and cerebellum – the main control centers for multiple life functions including sensory perception and movement. From the brain stem, these impulses travel throughout the brain and activate or reactivate neurons and structures involved in human function. Researchers believe that targeted physical therapy with neurostimulation can initiate a sequential cascade of changes in the neuronal network, supporting the rebuilding and restructuring 
 4

(neuroplasticity) of fundamental connections between the anatomical components of the brain.  The PoNS device is also a smart device with built in technology to allow for tracking of the patient’s use, including time and intensity of treatments.
 Design
 The PoNS device is ergonomically designed for patient comfort, is relatively light, contains a replaceable hygienic mouthpiece and a rechargeable battery with built-in technology that allows for technical data logging and communications. See Figure 1.
Figure 1
 The portable neuromodulation stimulator, PoNS device
 The mouthpiece of the PoNS device is held lightly in place by the lips and teeth around the neck of the tab that goes into the mouth and rests on the anterior and superior part of the tongue. See Figure 2.
Figure 2
 A rechargeable lithium polymer battery with built-in charge safety circuitry provides power. While the voltage and pulse timing to each electrode are programmed into the device and cannot be altered, the user can adjust the stimulus intensity, which is achieved by adjusting the electrical pulse width. The sensation produced by the mouthpiece is similar to the feeling of drinking a carbonated beverage. The patented waveform is specifically designed to minimize the potential for tissue irritation.
Concurrent Use With Targeted Physical and/or Cognitive Therapy
 We have designed the PoNS Treatment whereby translingual neurostimulation is performed in conjunction with targeted physical and/or cognitive therapy. The PoNS Treatment training sessions will typically initially commence with twice a day sessions for two weeks in an outpatient physical therapy clinic, or PTC, and will be performed under the supervision of a PoNS-certified physical therapist. In-clinic treatment will be followed by use by the patient at home. Upon completion of the in-clinic portion of the PoNS Treatment, we expect patients will be monitored throughout their home treatment by their physician or at the PTC. The PoNS device has a design 
 5

feature that stops delivering treatment every 14 weeks, thus requiring patients to return to their physician or PTC for assessment of their progress, reestablishment of challenging physical therapy to achieve higher goals and download of utilization data (duration and intensity of use). We believe the utilization data will be helpful for reimbursement and future research. At that time, the PoNS device can also be inspected visually by the physician or physical therapist, reset for another 14 weeks of treatment if necessary, and the mouthpiece replaced. This model is expected to ensure proper support for patients in the early phase of their treatment and to enhance the healthcare professional-patient relationship.
 We expect physicians will be educated on how to prescribe the PoNS Treatment by our members of our medical affairs team. We anticipate supporting the launch of the PoNS Treatment with the development and implementation of a hub services center with online and offline elements to help facilitate the healthcare transaction.
 PoNS Trials in TBI
 PoNS Registrational Clinical Trial
 We completed our registrational clinical trial of the PoNS Treatment for persons with mmTBI in 2017. It was a double-blind randomized, controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS Treatment using translingual noninvasive stimulation in persons with chronic balance deficit due to mmTBI. 
 The trial was launched in 2015 in conjunction with the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and was conducted at seven sites in the United States and Canada. The trial evaluated 122 randomized participants between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Each participant received five weeks of treatment, two weeks in clinic and three weeks at home. The treatment consisted of standardized targeted physical therapy geared toward the functional capability of each individual participant. Enrolled participants worked with a certified PoNS trainer and were randomized to receive either a high-frequency pulse, or HFP, (25.7 million pulses per 20-minute treatment) or a low-frequency pulse, or LFP, (13,728 pulses per 20-minute treatment) PoNS device.  While the HFP and the LFP devices were identical, the frequency of the pulses were different.
 Trial Design
 All participants provided a prior neuroradiologic report (obtained at least one year after the most recent mmTBI), if available, and completed demographic and quality of life surveys and a medical history during an initial screening visit.  Participants who met the initial screening entrance criteria were scheduled for an MRI of the head, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, the NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test, or SOT, to evaluate balance, and a 20-minute walk on the treadmill to evaluate fitness.  Key eligibility criteria to participate in the study included the following:

• | Male or female, 18 to 65 years of age.
--+---------------------------------------


• | At least 1-year post most recent mmTBI at the time of screening.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Had participated in a focused physical rehabilitation program for mmTBI and had been deemed by their treating clinician to have reached a plateau.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Had a balance disorder SOT composite score of at least 16 points below the normative value for the participant’s age.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stable neurologic status, as determined from the participant’s medical records and the trial physician’s opinion based on no new or changing symptoms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Participants meeting all the eligibility criteria, and who were not disqualified by exclusion criteria applicable to the trial, were enrolled and randomly assigned in blocks of four to receive an HFP or LFP device.  Randomization occurred at each site, according to the randomization plan developed by the clinical research organization. An objective balance assessment was performed using the composite score from the SOT, which measures balance using computerized sensors that objectively measure participants’ ability to maintain balance under six different conditions. The SOT is a widely used measurement tool for balance disorder associated with TBI and was used as the primary efficacy endpoint for the trial. According to published clinical trial data, patients that received physical therapy alone to treat balance deficit related to mmTBI improved by an average of ten to 13 points on the SOT scale, a 0 to 100 scale, and clinical experience shows those patients tend to drift back to their baseline disability when physical therapy is discontinued.  On average, participants entered the trial with an SOT composite score of approximately 40, which is a score that indicates substantially compromised functional balance. In the trial, an SOT responder was defined as a participant with an improvement of at least 15 points in his/her SOT composite score from baseline to the end of five weeks of PoNS Treatment, a level of change that to our knowledge, has never been achieved in clinical trials of patients with mmTBI-related balance disorder undergoing standard of care physical therapy.  
 Trial Results
 The trial’s statistical analysis plan stated  that, if  the outcome of the primary effectiveness endpoint showed that PoNS Treatment in the HFP and LFP arms both produced responses of greater than 15 points on the SOT composite score that were not significantly different from one another, the secondary endpoint would be calculated by combining the two groups and comparing the response to baseline at week two and week five.  This would imply that both devices had a clinical effect.
 6

The primary effectiveness endpoint demonstrated a trend toward a higher responder rate in the HFP arm (with 75.4% of subjects experiencing a greater than 15 point improvement on the SOT composite score) than in the LFP arm (with 60.7% of subjects experiencing a greater than 15 point improvement on the SOT composite score), p<0.081. The primary effectiveness endpoint was not reached because of the significant therapeutic effect observed in the LFP arm.  Because both arms produced responses of greater than 15 points on the SOT composite score that were not significantly different from one another, the secondary effectiveness endpoint was calculated per the statistical analysis plan, as described above.  The secondary effectiveness endpoints demonstrated statistically and clinically significant increases in SOT composite scores:
 
 
o | The mean improvement at two weeks for the pooled arms was 18.3 points, P<0.0005.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The mean improvement at five weeks for the pooled arms was 24.6 points, P<0.0005.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since the majority of patients who have a chronic balance disorder associated with mmTBI are subjected to a higher risk of falls and headaches, the primary safety endpoint was an improvement in the frequency of falls as determined by daily event recording on the participant data case report form during the in-clinic phase of the study (week two).  The secondary safety endpoint was the frequency and severity of headaches, as measured by the Headache Disability Index at baseline and at the end of treatment, which was at week five.
 
o | We successfully met the primary and secondary safety endpoints as measured by a decrease in falls at week two a decrease in headaches at week five, respectively, in both treatment groups.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | There were no serious device related adverse events.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

PoNS Long-Term Treatment Trial: A 26-Week Study
 This study was performed to understand the durability of response to the PoNS Treatment. This double-blind randomized controlled study in patients with mmTBI was completed in 2017 at the Tactile Communication Neurorehabilitation Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and was sponsored by the U.S. Army. The study was conducted with 22 and 21 participants randomized to the HFP and LFP PoNS Treatment arms, respectively. Participants underwent 14 weeks of active treatment identical in format to the treatment regime in our registrational clinical trial described above, followed by a 12-week washout period when participants discontinued the PoNS Treatment and were told to resume normal daily lifestyles with no specified physical therapy regime. SOT composite scores were captured at specific time points throughout the study, including at 14 weeks and after the 12-week washout (26 weeks).
 Highlights of the study results were as follows:
  
o | There was no statistical difference between the HFP and LFP PoNS Treatment arms mirroring the results of the registrational clinical trial.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | On average, participants entered the study with an SOT composite score of approximately 40, which is a score that indicates substantially compromised functional balance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | At the end of 14 weeks of active treatment with the HFP PoNS arm, patients showed improvements on average of 29.7 points on the SOT composite score.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | After the 12-week washout period, the participants, on average, maintained the same SOT composite score as after 14 weeks of PoNS treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Conclusion:
  
o | The study demonstrated that the PoNS Treatment could, on average, allow patients with mmTBI who had chronic balance deficit and other injury-related functional disabilities, achieve an SOT composite score in the normal range in 14 weeks and maintain that benefit after a 12-week washout period. We believe that this data supports the durability of the response to the treatment and the potential restoration of the balance system. Furthermore, in a subset of nine participants, sequential magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans were performed that showed increased grey matter volume in the cerebellum and elsewhere, commensurate with improved balance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall Conclusion From the Two mmTBI Trials.
 We believe the most significant observations from the two mmTBI trials are:
  
• | Our registrational and long-term treatment trials combined were the largest neuromodulation trials in mmTBI with neuromodulation ever performed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7

 
• | Participants who had a profound, chronic balance disorder resistant to conventional physical therapy, and with a prognosis of a lifetime of this disability were, on average, in the normal range of balance following the 14 weeks of treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a subset of nine participants, MRI scans revealed structural changes in the brain resulting from the neuromodulation inducing neuroplastic effect.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The PoNS Treatment in one data set also resulted, on average, in patients maintaining the improvement for at least a 12-week period suggesting a permanent improvement in participants’ chronic balance issues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no differences in clinical outcomes across the clinical trial sites performing both trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no differences at baseline in age, sex, time from injury, amount of previous physical therapy, level of disability or adherence to therapy in each of the treatment groups.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The difference in therapeutic effect noted between high and low frequency pulse groups suggests that there was an independent device effect.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Submissions
 
In October 2018, we received our Canadian marketing authorization allowing us to commercialize the PoNS Treatment in Canada.
 
As part of the submission process for de novo classification and 510(k) clearance, the FDA encourages companies to engage in pre-submission meetings to obtain the agency’s perspective and feedback. In the second and third quarters of 2018, we met with the FDA in two pre-submission meetings, the first of which focused on the design verification testing used to support our submission, and the second of which focused on our clinical data. In August 2018, we submitted a request to the FDA for de novo classification and 510(k) clearance of the PoNS device. Our request incorporated feedback that we obtained from the FDA in the pre-submission meetings.
 
In January 2019, we received a request for additional information, or AI, from the FDA and the FDA placed its review on administrative hold until we submitted the requested information.  In March 2019, we submitted the information requested by FDA, which we expect will enable the FDA to resume its review for our de novo classification and 510(k) clearance.
 
In December 2018, we submitted an application for a CE Mark, which, if approved, would allow us to market the PoNS device in the EU.
 Planned Studies
 Multiple Sclerosis
 According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, there are approximately one million individuals in the United States living with multiple sclerosis, or MS, for an annual economic cost of approximately $28 billion. Many of these patients experience balance problems and studies from several countries estimate that 50% to 70% of MS patients had reported falls within the past two to six months.
 There have been two published studies of PoNS Treatment in participants with MS demonstrating improvements in balance and gait and in one, significant improvements in blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI scans. Therefore we are interested in evaluating the potential of the PoNS Treatment to ameliorate symptoms in patients with MS. The FDA has determined that we must obtain an investigational device exemption, or IDE, prior to commencing any clinical trial of the PoNS Treatment in patients with MS in the United States.  We intend to commence a registrational clinical trial of the PoNS Treatment in MS patients with balance and gait deficit once we receive FDA clearance to market the PoNS Treatment for mmTBI, contingent on the availability of funding and the timing of our submission and approval of an IDE by the FDA. 
 Stroke
 Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 795,000 annual episodes, resulting in approximately 140,000 deaths per year. The term “stroke” or “brain attack” implies brain tissue has been destroyed – because one of the vessels that provide oxygen and nutrients to the brain has ruptured or become blocked by atheromatous plaque or a blood clot traveling from elsewhere in the body, often due to an irregularly beating heart. Whichever mechanism leads to a stroke, the end result is the same; death of brain tissue and variable disability depending on what parts of the brain have been affected.  The disability may be the inability to feel or move a part of the body, to speak, think, or many other possible symptoms. Acute treatment includes drugs, interventional radiology or surgery to stop bleeding or remove blockages. Thereafter, therapy is focused on trying to help the patient recover use of disabled anatomy with physical therapy or learn to overcome disability with occupational therapy. A published study conducted by a researcher at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia observed that patients with sub-acute stroke induced balance issues experienced a statistically significant improvement in the mini balance evaluation systems test, a clinical balance assessment tool, following PoNS Treatment compared to physiotherapy alone.  We are determining next steps for our studies of the PoNS Treatment for stroke patients, which are subject to the availability of funding.

Partnerships and Agreements
 U.S. Army Partnership
 In February 2013, we entered into a collaborative relationship with the U.S. Army pursuant to a February 2013 cooperative research and development agreement, as amended, or the CRADA, to determine if the PoNS Treatment could be developed for commercial use in the treatment of soldiers and others with a variety of military-relevant neurological manifestations of TBI, including tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, pain and any subsequent indications identified by the parties. 
 In July 2015, we entered into a sole source cost sharing agreement, or the U.S. Army Agreement, with the U.S. Army for the commercial development of the PoNS Treatment for chronic balance deficits related to mmTBI. Pursuant to the U.S. Army Agreement, the laboratories of the U.S. Army Medical Material Agency, and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, or USAMRMC, (collectively, the “Army Laboratories”) agreed to cooperate with us on clinical studies and regulatory responsibilities necessary to obtain FDA marketing authorization for this indication.  Under the U.S. Army Agreement, we were the sole regulatory sponsor and oversaw and executed all required clinical studies. Further, the U.S. Army reimbursed us for the initially budgeted costs related to the registrational clinical trial of the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS Treatment for chronic balance deficits related to mmTBI, up to a maximum amount of $3.0 million. 
 In November 2018, the Army Laboratories notified us of their intention to terminate the CRADA, effective December 31, 2018.  In December 2018, the U.S. Army notified us that it was amending the U.S. Army Agreement to provide that our obligations under the contract were satisfied upon our submission of an application for marketing authorization of the PoNS device to the FDA.
 Our satisfaction of the U.S. Army Agreement and the termination of the CRADA concluded our formal contractual relationships with the U.S. Army.  We are currently focusing on partnering with the relevant departments in the U.S. Department of Defense, or DOD, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or Veterans Affairs, to obtain reimbursement, upon FDA marketing authorization, for U.S. military personnel using our PoNS Treatment.  
 As of December 31, 2018, we received a total of approximately $3.0 million with respect to reimbursements for expenses owed to us for completion of development milestones. All reimbursement amounts received were credited directly to research and development expenses. 
 Canadian Strategic Alliance
 In September 2018, we entered into an exclusive strategic alliance agreement with Health Tech Connex, Inc., or HTC, and Heuro Canada Inc., or Heuro, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of HTC, to establish three founding clinics to treat patients and create a replicable model for future clinic expansion. Under the terms of the agreement, Heuro is responsible for the development of the clinic systems to facilitate the commercialization of the PoNS Treatment in Canada. The parties will contract with the clinics and develop a model for the clinics to deliver clinical services, featuring the PoNS Treatment, to manage neurological conditions. The parties are developing a clinical assessment plan to support the expansion of the neuroplasticity clinic system beyond the initial three founding clinics throughout Canada. The clinical assessment plan is a plan comprised of (i) the minimum criteria necessary for the parties to proceed with a clinical expansion plan and (ii) a framework for a replicable clinical model, which is anticipated to include among other things, policies and procedures, training modules, product distribution, storage and inventory requirements. The clinical expansion plan is a business plan for the expansion of the neuroplasticity clinic system beyond the initial three founding clinics throughout Canada through a franchise model.
 A joint steering committee, or JSC, comprised of three representatives from each of HTC and Helius and one representative of Heuro, will oversee the establishment of the founding clinics and the development of the expansion plan to commercialize the PoNS Treatment and other clinical services. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the JSC approved and engaged two of the founding clinics to deliver the PoNS Treatment. In February 2019, we entered into supply agreements with these two founding clinics and we fulfilled our first commercial orders for the sale of the PoNS device. The founding clinics began treating patients in March 2019.
 The agreement also provides for HTC to pay Helius CAD$750,000 in three annual payments of CAD$250,000 beginning December 31, 2019, in consideration for the exclusivity right we granted to Heuro. The term of the agreement is the earlier of September 2023 or the formal adoption of a clinical expansion plan. Under the terms of the agreement, each of Helius and HTC has agreed to fund up 50% of the Heuro’s operating budget as agreed to by the JSC not to exceed CAD$1 million each. Helius and HTC have also agreed to share in any net profits and losses of Heuro on a 50/50 basis. 
 
A&B Asset Purchase Agreement
 
In October 2015, we entered into a strategic agreement with A&B (HK) Company Ltd., or A&B, an investment and development company based in Hong Kong for the development and commercialization of the PoNS Treatment in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore, collectively referred to as the Territories. The agreement transferred ownership of certain our Asian patents, patent applications, and product support material for the PoNS device from us to A&B and granted to A&B, among other things, an exclusive license to market, promote, distribute and sell the PoNS devices solely within the Territories. Pursuant to the agreement, A&B has 
 9

assumed all development, patent (both application and defense), future manufacturing, clinical trial, and regulatory clearance costs for the Territories. A&B and us will share and transfer ownership of any intellectual property or support material (developed by either party) for each of our respective geographies. 
 
In connection with the agreement, A&B agreed to provide us with a $7.0 million funding commitment, consisting of an initial $2.0 million convertible promissory note and a $5.0 million funding commitment. On October 9, 2015, we received the conversion notice on the promissory note and, on November 10, 2015, we issued 416,666 shares of common stock at a price of $4.80 per share and 208,333 warrants exercisable at $7.20 per share for a period of three years from the date of issuance. On December 29, 2015, we drew down the $5.0 million funding commitment through the January 7, 2016 issuance of 1,111,111 shares of common stock at a price of $4.50 per share and 555,556 warrants exercisable at $6.75 per share for a period of three years from the date of issuance. In November 2017, A&B exercised 208,333 warrants at a price of $7.20 per share and we received gross proceeds of $1.5 million. During the first quarter of 2018, A&B exercised its remaining 555,556 warrants at a price of $6.75 per share and we received gross proceeds of $3.8 million.
 
In August 2018, A&B executed a transfer agreement whereby A&B transferred all the assets under the A&B asset purchase agreement with us to China Medical Systems, or CMS, Medical Limited, a Malaysian based Hong Kong listed company and an affiliate of A&B. In February 2019, we executed a novation deed whereby CMS Medical Limited irrevocably assigned and transferred all of its rights, obligations and assets under the transfer agreement to CMS Medical Hong Kong Limited, a Hong Kong-based investment holding company principally engaged in the manufacture, marketing, promotion and sales of pharmaceutical products. We are currently working with CMS in providing regulatory support of its application to the National Medical Products Administration for marketing authorization in China.
 Russia Distribution Agreement
 In November 2014, we signed a development and distribution agreement with Altair LLC to apply for registration and distribution of the PoNS device in the territories of the former Soviet Union. We will receive a 7% royalty on sales of the devices within the territories, but to date no sales have occurred.  The PoNS device has been approved in Russia and Uzbekistan as an authorized medical device for the treatment of cerebral palsy and other neurological conditions, but we have not delivered any commercial devices in any of these territories. We are in the process of developing the go to market strategy for the region prior to renegotiating this distribution agreement.
Product Development, Manufacturing and Logistics Services
 In January 2017, we entered into an agreement with Cambridge Consultants LLC, or Cambridge, pursuant to which Cambridge assumed responsibilities for key aspects of the design and development of the PoNS device. As part of the agreement, Cambridge will validate the performance of the engineering, design verification testing and product documentation to support our FDA submission. Cambridge will also assist us in the identification of, and transition to, our commercial-scale manufacturer.  
 On December 29, 2017, we selected Key Tronic Corporation, or Key Tronic, as our contract-manufacturing partner for the PoNS device after a competitive selection process. The commercial design of the PoNS device will be manufactured and assembled at Key Tronic’s facilities located in Oakdale, Minnesota. Key Tronic manufactured devices for engineering and design verification testing and for our FDA submission as well as commercial devices for launch inventory.  Key Tronic has multiple locations across the United States, Mexico and China with back-up manufacturing capabilities to help mitigate the risk of a single source provider. We remain ultimately responsible for the compliance of our submissions and products, and activities performed on our behalf.
 We place an emphasis on protecting our patented technology, trade secrets and know-how and only share confidential information on an as needed basis. Key Tronic is registered as a medical device manufacturer in good standing with the FDA and along with Cambridge are certified in accordance with International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 13485, a comprehensive quality management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices.  
 On November 30, 2016, HMI received our ISO 13485:2003 certification, which was updated to the 2016 standard during the fourth quarter of 2018 along with receiving our Medical Device Single Audit Plan, or MDSAP, for the United States and Canada, with the scope of the MDSAP certification expanded to include Australia during the second quarter of 2019.
 In February 2019, we entered into an agreement with McKesson Specialty Care Distribution LLC, or McKesson, pursuant to which McKesson will provide a comprehensive array of logistical, account management and related distribution services for the commercialization of the PoNS device in the United States. These services will include among other things, shipment of the PoNS device to qualified customers, storage and warehousing of the PoNS device in suitable storage facilities, program management, customer care and operations support. The initial term of the agreement will be for three years unless otherwise terminated as set forth in the agreement. The agreement shall continue in force and effect for successive one-year periods after the initial term unless terminated by either party by notice no less than 90 days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term.
 Commercialization
 
Canadian Commercialization
 
10

As previously discussed, in September 2018, we entered in to an exclusive strategic alliance agreement with HTC and Heuro to launch neuroplasticity clinics to commercialize the PoNS Treatment in Canada.  This agreement allows us to efficiently market and distribute the PoNS Treatment in Canada without building costly infrastructure, thus enabling us to maintain our focus on being a medical device developer.  Through Heuro, we plan to build the requisite commercial and operating infrastructure to begin treating patients in Canada. To date, two PoNS Treatment clinics have been engaged. In February 2019, we entered into supply agreements with each of these clinics to supply them with PoNS devices and we fulfilled our first commercial orders of the PoNS devices from these clinics. In March 2019, these clinics treated the first patients with the PoNS Treatment, realizing an important milestone for us. 
 
The Canadian marketplace for the treatment of chronic balance deficit due to mmTBI is very similar to that of the United States in that our initial market will be defined by cash paying customers.  We expect that patients in Canada will then submit applications for reimbursement of the cost of the PoNS Treatment to the provincial workers’ compensation, or WC, auto insurance and commercial insurance reimbursement initiatives and, over time, government programs when warranted.  
 
As part of our overall PoNS Treatment strategy, we will be gathering comprehensive health economic assessments of treatment outcomes.  We have developed a system whereby these outcome data will be depersonalized to protect patient identities and aggregated so that we can produce a prospective real-world treatment adherence and outcomes database that will help us better understand the recovery benefits as well as the health economic benefits of the PoNS Treatment.  These data will, in-turn, be used to support our applications for WC, auto insurance and commercial insurance reimbursement initiatives in Canada, the United States and other markets around the world. The Canadian commercial experience will be extremely valuable to prepare us for our launches in the United States and internationally.

In the United States, the PoNS device is an investigational device pending a final decision from the FDA on our application for de novo classification and 510(k) clearance.  In January 2019, we received an AI request from the FDA.  In March 2019, we submitted the information requested by FDA, which we expect will enable the FDA to resume its review of our request for de novo classification and 510(k) clearance.  We look forward to the FDA’s feedback on our submission.  
 
In this pre-commercial phase, we are focused on building relationships with key large neurorehabilitation centers, generating important data on outcomes of the PoNS Treatment and ensuring that our scientific data is presented at many of the key national and international neurology and neuromodulation meetings. We believe this scientific dissemination will begin to pave the way to establishing the PoNS Treatment as the standard of care for the treatment of mmTBI-related balance deficit following FDA marketing authorization.
 
Clinical Experience Programs
 
In 2018, we initiated a series of clinical experience programs, or CEPs, to prepare for a potential U.S. commercial launch.  Originally, our CEPs were designed to accomplish three objectives: 

(i) | Learn from and build experiential relationships with key large neurorehabilitation clinics.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Train and certify physical therapists to ensure maximum patient benefit.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Generate health economic, return-to-work and clinical data to help increase our understanding of our payer strategy. Such data will include a functional capacity evaluation, which should give us a robust data set to demonstrate an economic benefit to a WC, auto insurance or commercial insurance payer.
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on receipt of Canadian marketing authorization of our PoNS device earlier than anticipated, we expect that our early Canadian commercialization activities will provide us with the health economic, return-to-work and clinical data that we had planned to generate in the CEPs.  As a result, we have restructured the goal of our CEPs to focus on the other two objectives and to gather data on varying treatment protocols to accumulate real world treatment protocol experience compared to our clinical trial protocols. In addition, based on payer research indicating the importance of the durability of response post-treatment in coverage decisions, we revised the CEP protocol to enable the gathering of treatment durability data at 6 and 12 months. 
 
To date, we have enrolled five clinic centers in the United States in CEPs: the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, a leading neurorehabilitation center located in Columbus, OH; Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, NY; Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR; Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation and Kessler Foundation in Hanover, NJ; and the Baylor Research Institute in Dallas, TX.  We plan to add our own clinic, Helius NeuroRehab, in Newtown, PA, as a sixth site.
 
U.S. Commercialization
 
To commercialize the PoNS Treatment in the United States following FDA marketing authorization, we plan to execute a highly targeted launch.  We will target a subset of neurorehabilitation centers that have been profiled as early adopters to develop a network of PoNS 
 11

certified neurorehabilitation centers beyond the initial six clinic centers that will be trained to deliver the PoNS Treatment through our CEP program.  Care of patients with brain injuries is concentrated in major neurorehabilitation centers that often have a network of outpatient rehabilitation clinics, where most of the PoNS Treatment will take place.  We believe that a small, specialty sales force, calling on new technology review boards for trial and in-house physiatrists, neurologists and physical therapists, will be sufficient to drive trial and adoption of the PoNS Treatment in certified neurorehabilitation centers.  Importantly, this focused strategy will also allow us to inspect whether we are generating patient outcomes similar to those seen in our clinical trials.  
 
We are planning to provide broad access and reimbursement for the PoNS Treatment over time.  At launch, prior to the initiation of broad payer coverage, we anticipate the primary source of sales will be self-pay patients.  We will support the cost of the PoNS Treatment by collaborating with third parties to provide self-pay patients with financing options as well as working with advocacy groups and charitable organizations to help self-pay patients access our technology.  We anticipate at least a 24-month window to obtain broad coverage and reimbursement among commercial and government payers.  We plan to work in parallel with non-traditional payers, such as WC, auto insurance and the military, by engaging with them and providing them with relevant health economic and return-to-work data obtained through our Canadian commercial experience.    
 
With the satisfaction of our clinical development contract with the U.S. Army, we are focusing on partnering with relevant departments in the DOD and Veterans Affairs to obtain reimbursement, upon FDA marketing authorization, for U.S. military personnel using our PoNS Treatment.  These two initiatives, among others, offer the potential to expand access more expeditiously to these high-unmet need patient populations. 
 
Commercialization in Other Markets
 
We have marketing authorization to commercialize the PoNS Treatment in Russia and Uzbekistan.  As previously discussed, we have developed a clinical relationship with Altair LLC, a Russian distribution company.  We have chosen to limit our commercial activity in Russia to Altair-owned clinics and to develop strategic relationships with Russian research institutions to treat patients with cerebral palsy and other neurological conditions prospectively defined in our development and distribution agreement. To date we have not delivered any commercial devices in any of these territories.
 
We submitted an application for a CE Mark in December 2018.  In preparation for our launch in the United Kingdom, or UK, and the EU, we have entered into a consulting agreement with a UK-based company with expertise in the development of new services in the healthcare industry. The goal is to leverage local market insights to develop a comprehensive commercialization strategy and tactical plan for launch of the PoNS Treatment in the UK. This approach will allow us to focus our internal infrastructure on the Canadian and United States launches while assessing our opportunity in the EU and the UK. We believe that the timing of our CE Mark application decision, which may be affected by issues related to the United Kingdom’s pending exit from the European Union, commonly known as “Brexit,” will drive our decision on our commercial launch in the UK.
 
We anticipate submitting an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA in Australia during the second quarter of 2019.  We are working with consultants in Australia with expertise in market development to build our go-to-market strategy.  
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 With the completion of our registrational clinical trial, and if we obtain FDA marketing authorization for the treatment of balance disorder in mmTBI, we plan to engage with select payer segments to obtain coverage and reimbursement for the PoNS Treatment.  We intend to combine evidence from our clinical trials and real-world experience from commercial clinics in Canada, to demonstrate the value proposition of the PoNS Treatment to payers and support favorable coverage and reimbursement decisions.
 We believe that non-traditional payers may be among the earliest to provide coverage and reimbursement for the PoNS Treatment. Therefore, we plan to focus initially on gaining coverage for the PoNS Treatment through WC payers. WC is an entitlement for injured workers, and payers are responsible for both medical and indemnity claims. Because these payers are responsible for both medical expenses and lost wages, they have an incentive to seek ways to help injured workers to return to work.  As part of our commercial treatment program in Canada, we will collect both outcomes and return to work data, which we plan to utilize with WC payers to demonstrate both the clinical and economic value associated with the PoNS Treatment.  
 Similarly, military payers have an interest in reducing both medical costs and shortening the time to return to work for people who were injured while serving our country. We are working toward establishing relationships with thought leaders affiliated with the Veterans Affairs, and will focus on obtaining reimbursement through this payer segment at launch.  We anticipate that the same clinical and economic evidence that we will use with WC payers will also help to support gaining coverage and reimbursement for the PoNS Treatment from the Veterans Affairs.   
 In parallel, we will engage with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMMS, and select commercial payers, with a recognition that obtaining coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial payers is likely to take at least 24 months.  
 12

Because there are no approved treatments for chronic balance deficit due to mmTBI and there is a high-unmet need among patients, we anticipate that there will be demand to access the PoNS Treatment following FDA marketing authorization. We have contracted with McKesson to set up and deploy a reimbursement hub for the PoNS Treatment, following FDA marketing authorization.   This will provide patients with the means to navigate potential reimbursement and to demonstrate patient demand for the PoNS Treatment to payers.   
 We also plan to apply this evidence to support an application for a unique HCPCS code for the PoNS device, which will be required to support reimbursement by Medicare.  The process for submitting a HCPCS code is lengthy, and gated by an annual submission date.  In the interim period prior to submitting for and potentially receiving this code, we will utilize a miscellaneous code for the purposes of submitting to payers for reimbursement.  While this code is likely to be denied by commercial and government payers, it will be an important mechanism to register the demand for the PoNS Treatment with payers, and potentially expedite the sense of urgency to make coverage decisions and enter into reimbursement discussions.
   If approved, at launch, we will support our customers with hub services to aid in submitting their expense to private insurers as well as the communication between the patient, physician and physical therapist.  The PoNS device is a smart-device with built in technology to allow tracking of patient use including time and intensity of treatments.  We have created a device management application which allows the PT to gather the information from the device on the patient’s usage to guide further treatment option discussions with the patient’s physician as well as to use the adherence data to support coverage and reimbursement decisions by insurance carriers.
 
Competition
 The neurostimulation market is predominantly comprised of invasive technologies that are not directly competitive with our technology. Our competitors in the industry are predominantly large, publicly-traded companies that have a history in the market, have significantly easier access to capital and other resources and have an established product pipeline. The combined clinical research and product development done by the industry, including by us and all of our competitors, is uncovering the secrets of neuro-modulation which now establishes neurostimulation as a legitimate and scientifically validated approach to the treatment of neurological conditions, and accordingly, we expect for competition in the non-invasive space to grow in the future.
 However, we believe that we will have the first-mover advantage in the non-invasive neurostimulation space.
 We believe that the PoNS Treatment introduces an innovative target and method of stimulation because targeting the tongue for neurostimulation provides several advantages that competitively distinguish the PoNS Treatment, which are discussed below. 
 Advantages of the PoNS Treatment
 We believe that the PoNS Treatment offers the following benefits over existing neuro-stimulation technologies:
  
• | The PoNS Treatment stimulates the trigeminal nerve which developing science has implicated to be beneficial in some neurological disorder models. The PoNS Treatment stimulates the lingual part of the nerve through the tongue, while other technologies stimulate other branches of the trigeminal nerve. It is the largest branch, having the highest amount of nerve fibers of the three branches. We believe this will be an advantage in our therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stimulating the tongue also allows for the simultaneous stimulation of a second cranial nerve found in the tongue, the facial nerve. The ability to stimulate more than one nerve alone differentiates us from our competition. However, it has not been scientifically proven that stimulating additional nerves adds to the efficacy or safety of the PoNS Treatment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The tongue has an anatomically unique surface with a high density of receptors, a consistently moist and conductive environment, constant pH, constant temperature and a direct connection to the brain through at least two cranial nerves.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scientific studies suggest that the trigeminal cranial nerves offer a high-bandwidth pathway for impulses to directly affect the central nervous system. The trigeminal nerves project directly onto several areas of the brain, primarily the brainstem (trigeminal and solitary nuclei), cerebellum, cochlear nuclei and spinal cord. Secondary targets include the limbic system, basal ganglia and thalamus. We believe that this range of projections will allow impulses to be sent through sites regulating dozens of functions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unlike deep brain stimulation devices, implantable vagal nerve devices and other invasive forms of electrical stimulation, the tongue allows for neurostimulation to be delivered non-invasively and portably. This opens the door for integration of neurostimulation with a wide range of therapies previously unexplored for neurological rehabilitation.

 The license of the Patent Pending Rights is also subject to the terms of the CRADA. In the event that we are not willing or unable to commercialize the PoNS technology within four years from the expiration of the CRADA, the Company is required to transfer possession, ownership and sponsorship/holdership of the regulation application, regulatory correspondence and supporting regulatory information related technology to USAMRMC and grant the U.S. Government a non-exclusive, irrevocable license to any patent, copyright, data rights, proprietary information or regulatory information for the U.S. Government to commercialize the technology.
 On April 17, 2017, we announced that the USPTO had issued two medical method patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,597,501 and 9,597,504) that together further protect the intellectual property rights for our core asset, the PoNS device therapeutic techniques. These patents bolster the current family of PoNS patents protecting various forms of targeted physical therapy combinations with both skin and oral cavity stimulation using the PoNS device or any equivalent neurostimulation device. On May 23, 2017, we announced that the USPTO had issued its first method patent (US Patent No. 9,656,069) that features claims directed to the use of the PoNS device for human performance improvement rather than rehabilitation therapy.
 Company Owned Intellectual Property
 As of December 31, 2018, we have filed 30 U.S. patent applications related to various technical and ornamental aspects of the PoNS device: 14 non-provisional patent applications that describe various technical features in the current version device and 16 design patent applications describing various ornamental designs. We are the sole assignee for these 30 U.S. patent filings. Prior to issuance, once the USPTO determines that, a patent application meets all of the statutory requirements for patentability, it provides a notice of allowance. In addition to the first issued patent (U.S. Patent No. 9,072,889), the USPTO has issued 10 utility patents, 16 design patents and provided notices of allowance for utility applications as summarized in the table below:

 Government Regulation  
 Our products under development and our operations are subject to significant government regulation. In the United States, our products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. The following is a general description of the review and marketing authorization process of the FDA for medical devices.
 20

FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
 The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, the following activities with respect to medical devices:
  
• | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical trials;
--+-----------------


• | product storage and safety;
--+----------------------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | pre-market clearance and approval;
--+-----------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market approval studies; and
--+----------------------------------


• | product import and export.
--+---------------------------

 In the United States, numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed. These include the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic, or FD&C Act and the FDA’s implementing regulations, among others.
 The FDA Review, Clearance and Approval Processes
 Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act; receive de novo down-classification and 510(k) clearance, or pre-market approval application, or PMA, from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the FDA. FDA review and approval is required for each intended use of a device, regardless of whether the device has been approved for other indications for use. The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose the lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification application requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States, unless the device is exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device are categorized as Class III and require submission and approval of a PMA.
 In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a device legally on the market, known as a “predicate” device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data may be required to support a determination of substantial equivalence. The PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. However, some devices are automatically assigned to Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose, because they have not previously been classified into a lower risk class by the FDA. Manufacturers of these devices may request that the FDA review such devices in accordance with the de novo classification procedure, which allows a manufacturer whose novel device would otherwise require the submission and approval of a PMA prior to marketing to request down-classification of the device on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk. If the FDA agrees with the down-classification, the applicant will then receive clearance of a 510(k) to market the device. This cleared device can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions by the manufacturer or a competitor.
 We utilized the de novo classification procedures to seek our marketing authorization for the PoNS device, because there is no predicate cleared or approved by the FDA for commercial distribution and no existing classification decision by the FDA for such a device. 
 If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for the PoNS device, introducing the product could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our launch to be delayed. In addition, the FDA may determine that the PoNS device requires the more costly, lengthy and uncertain PMA process. For example, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that the de novo classification procedures are the appropriate path to obtain marketing authorizations for the PoNS device, the FDA may require us to submit a PMA application, which is generally more costly and uncertain and can take from one to three years, or longer, from the time 
 21

the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. Further, even with respect to those future products where a PMA may not be required, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain 510(k) clearances with respect to our PoNS device.
 510(k) Clearance Process
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or is a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA but may take significantly longer, including if FDA requests additional information, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the ability to rescind previously granted 510(k)s and additional requirements that may significantly affect the process.
 De novo Classification Process
 If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
 As previously discussed, we utilized the de novo classification process to request our marketing authorization for the PoNS device for balance disorder in mmTBI, and we plan to seek Class II classification. In order to be placed in Class II, the FDA would need reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the PoNS device. Under Class II, general controls (e.g., premarket notification) and special controls (e.g., specific performance testing) would be applicable. 
 Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, generally takes several years, and generally requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and clinical data. Notwithstanding the expense, these efforts may never result in FDA authorization for commercial distribution. Even if we were to obtain regulatory authorization, it may not be for the uses we believe are important or commercially attractive, in which case we would not be permitted to market our product for those uses.
 Pre-market Approval Process
 A PMA must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 After a PMA is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may 
 22

be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulations, or QSR, which may impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMAs or supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original pre-market approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 Clinical Trials
 A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. FDA’s regulations require submission and approval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, for all clinical investigations of significant risk medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness.  Abbreviated requirements apply for non-significant risk device studies.  After a clinical trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any clinical trials we conduct must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product, and separate clinical trials may be necessary to obtain clearance for multiple uses of one device.
Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 After a medical device is placed on the U.S. market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
  
• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction and removal reporting regulations which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance including medical device reporting, which requires manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other post-approval restrictions or conditions.
--+------------------------------------------------

Health Canada
 After a medical device has been approved for commercial use in Canada, there are a number of Health Canada requirements that must be adhered to including but not limited to the following:

• | annual license renewals;
--+-------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit on the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” use and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assessment of product modifications for significant changes that would require license amendments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance including medical device reporting, which requires manufacturers report to Health Canada if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other post-approval restrictions or conditions.
--+------------------------------------------------

European Union
 We submitted an application for a CE Mark of the PoNS device with our UK based notified body in December 2018.  The technical file for our PoNS device is currently under conformity assessment review by the notified body.  The successful completion of this review would result in marketing authorization for the sale of the PoNS device in the EU.  Some EU member states have additional notification requirements that we expect to satisfy before we launch our PoNS Treatment in those member states.  Once the PoNS device is placed into the EU market, post market requirements apply including but not limited to:

• | ensuring that the labeling promotes only approved use(s) of the device;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assessment of product modifications for significant changes may require license amendments;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance including vigilance reporting, which requires manufacturers report to authorities if our PoNS device caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other post-approval restrictions or conditions.
--+------------------------------------------------

Australia
 Our application material for marketing authorization in Australia is being currently being developed for a regulatory submission to the Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA during the second quarter of 2019.  Submittal of our application for marketing authorization to TGA may be delayed by activities taking place with the EU notified body, which certifies the quality management system. EU notified body activities are currently delayed by Brexit and the upcoming medical devices regulation changes.  
Our Corporate History Highlights
 Formation and Arrangement with Boomerang Oil, Inc.
 We were originally incorporated on March 13, 2014 under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act, or the BCBCA, as “0996445 B.C. Ltd.” On March 25, 2014, and amended on April 8, 2014, we entered into an arrangement agreement with Boomerang Oil, Inc. (formerly known as 0922327 B.C. Ltd.) and 0995162 B.C. Ltd. to reorganize the business structure of such three entities in such a manner which would allow Boomerang Oil, Inc. to spin us out to become an independent entity that is a reporting issuer in Canada and for us to complete a reverse take-over of 0995162 B.C. Ltd. As a result of the arrangement agreement, we became a reporting issuer in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. In addition, the arrangement resulted in 0995162 B.C. Ltd. becoming our wholly owned subsidiary. The assets of 0995162 B.C. Ltd. consisted of cash and 0995162 B.C. Ltd.’s interest in a letter agreement pursuant to which it had agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HMI, a Delaware corporation, and to seek a listing on a recognized stock exchange.
Reincorporation in Wyoming
 On May 23, 2014, we changed our name to “Helius Medical Technologies, Inc.” and filed articles of continuation with the Wyoming Secretary of State office to reincorporate from being a corporation governed by the BCBCA to a corporation governed by the Wyoming Business Corporation Act, or WBCA.
 Acquisition of NeuroHabilitation Corporation and Concurrent Financing
 On June 13, 2014, we completed the acquisition of NHC by way of an agreement and plan of merger. We refer to this transaction as the Reverse Merger. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, HMT Mergersub, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, merged with and into NHC with NHC as the surviving corporation. In connection with the Reverse Merger, we issued an aggregate of 7,060,016 shares of our Class A common stock, or our common stock, to the former shareholders of HMI. The Reverse Merger was deemed to be a capital transaction in substance and recorded as a reverse recapitalization of NHC whereby NHC is deemed to be the continuing, surviving entity for accounting purposes, but through reorganization, has deemed to have adopted the capital structure of Helius. On December 21, 2018, NHC changed its name to Helius Medical, Inc. 
 In connection with the Reverse Merger, we completed a non-brokered private placement financing of $7.02 million (CAD$7.62 million) by issuing 3,048,000 subscription receipts. Pursuant to its terms, each subscription receipt automatically converted into one unit upon satisfaction of certain escrow release conditions, which had been satisfied. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one-half of one share purchase warrant with each whole warrant being exercisable at CAD$5.00 per share for a period of two years. 
 24

Listing of our Common Stock on the CSE, TSX, OTCQB and Nasdaq
 Following our Reverse Merger, we obtained approval of the listing of our common stock on the Canadian Securities Exchange, or CSE. On April 18, 2016, our common stock was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, or TSX, under the symbol “HSM.” At the same time, we delisted our common stock from the CSE. Our Warrants were also approved for listing on the TSX on April 18, 2016. The Company’s common stock also began trading on the OTC Markets, or OTCQB, under the ticker symbol “HSDT” on February 10, 2015. On April 11, 2018, our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, and ceased to trade on the OTCBQ.
 Reverse Stock Split
 Effective after the close of business on January 22, 2018, we completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share, amounts in this Annual Report have been reflected on a post-split basis.
 Change in Functional Currency
 Prior to April 1, 2018, our functional currency was the Canadian dollar, or CAD$. We re-assessed our functional currency and determined that as of April 1, 2018, our functional currency had changed from the CAD$ to the U.S. dollar based on management's analysis of changes in the primary economic environment in which we operate. The change in functional currency was accounted for prospectively from April 1, 2018 and financial statements prior to and including the period ended March 31, 2018 were not restated for the change in functional currency.
Reincorporation in Delaware
 On June 28, 2018, at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved our reincorporation from the state of Wyoming to the state of Delaware. On July 20, 2018, we completed the reincorporation to the state of Delaware.
 As a result, following the reincorporation, we authorized capital stock pursuant to our Delaware charter of 150,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, at a par value per share of $0.001 and 10,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock at a par value per share of $0.001. Holders of common stock are entitled to vote at any meeting of the Company’s stockholders on the basis of one vote per share of common stock owned as of the record date of such meeting. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to receive dividends, if any, as declared by the directors. 
 
Formation of Helius NeuroRehab Inc.
 
In January 2019, we formed HNR, a Delaware corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. HNR will operate a clinical research site as well as a rehabilitation clinic that will provide PoNS Treatment to patients with balance and gait disorder following our receipt of marketing authorization from the FDA.
 
Corporate Information
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 642 Newtown Yardley Road, Suite 100, Newtown, PA 18940 and our telephone number is 215-944-6100. We maintain a corporate website at www.heliusmedical.com. We make available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, as soon as its reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to the SEC. We are not including the information on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into this report. Additionally, the SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information that issuers (including us) file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s website address is http://www.sec.gov.
 Employees
 We have a diverse, multi-cultural workforce comprised of engaged individuals with appropriate qualifications and competencies to support our growth. Members of our senior management team have an average of over 25 years of experience in the health sciences industry with recognized leadership expertise in their functional areas.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 25 full time employees and seven consultants.  With the submission of our application for marketing authorization to the FDA and for a CE Mark in Europe, and the receipt of a class II medical device license from Health Canada, we intend to invest in our commercialization infrastructure as we embark on the commercial deployment of the PoNS Treatment.
 Business Uncertainties and Going Concern Risk
 To date we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sale of products or services. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to generate sufficient revenue, including but not limited to the recruitment of patients for treatment in Canada, manufacturing of a commercially viable version of the PoNS device and demonstration of effectiveness sufficient to generate 
 25

commercial orders by customers for our product.  Moreover, because we expect that the revenue opportunity in the United States is significantly greater than in Canada, our ability to generate significant revenue in the future will be dependent upon the receipt of FDA marketing authorization of the PoNS device for treating balance disorder associated with mmTBI.  Because we have not generated any revenues from commercialization, we are dependent entirely on funding from outside investors. There is no guarantee that such funding will be available at all or in sufficient amounts to satisfy our required expenditures. Furthermore, even if we were able to raise sufficient capital to successfully design and manufacture a commercially viable version of the PoNS device and to receive FDA approval, a CE Mark or TGA clearance, we do not currently have any contracts or other arrangements to sell the PoNS device other than our Canadian distribution agreement. Accordingly, we cannot know that we will ever be able to generate sufficient revenue from the sales of products or services to achieve or maintain profitability.
 Additionally, based on management’s assessment, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business beyond the third quarter of 2019. While we had $25.6 million of cash as of December 31, 2018, we do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish all of the above conditions necessary for us to generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. In reviewing this filing, you should carefully consider this uncertainty, the risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and other risks described throughout this Annual Report.
