ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
----------------------------------+---------

GENERAL
 
Where Food Comes From, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“WFCF,” the “Company,” “our,” “we,” or “us”) is a leading trusted resource for third-party verification of food production practices in North America. The Company supports more than 15,000 farmers, ranchers, vineyards, wineries, processors, retailers, distributors, trade associations, consumer brands and restaurants with a wide variety of value-added services provided through its family of verifiers, including IMI Global, International Certification Services, Validus Verification Services, Sterling Solutions, and A Bee Organic. In order to have credibility, product claims such as gluten-free, non-GMO, non-hormone treated, humane handling, and others require verification by an independent third-party such as WFCF. The Company’s principal business is conducting both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, crops and other food products are accurate.
 
Through our more recent acquisitions, including SureHarvest Services LLC; Sow Organic, LLC; and JVF Consulting, LLC, we provide sustainability programs, compliance management and farming information management solutions to drive sustainable value creation. We employ a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) revenue model that bundles annual software licenses with ongoing software enhancements and upgrades and a wide range of professional services that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry.
 
Finally, the Company’s Where Food Comes From Source Verified® retail and restaurant labeling program utilizes the verification of product attributes to connect consumers directly to the source of the food they purchase through product labeling and web-based information sharing and education. With the use of Quick Response Code (“QR”) technology, consumers can instantly access information about the producers behind their food.
 
WFCF was founded in 1996 and incorporated in the state of Colorado as a subchapter C corporation in 2006. The Company’s shares of common stock trade on the OTCQB marketplace under the stock ticker symbol, “WFCF.”
 
The Company’s original name – Integrated Management Information, Inc. (d.b.a. IMI Global) – was changed to Where Food Comes From, Inc. in 2012 to better reflect the Company’s mission. Early growth was attributable to source and age verification services for beef producers that wanted access to markets overseas following the discovery of “mad cow” disease in the U.S. Over the years, WFCF has expanded its portfolio to include verification and software services for most food groups and 40 standards. This growth has been achieved both organically and through the acquisition of other companies.
 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
What We Do
 
The Company is one of the nation’s largest independent, third-party traceability and verification providers. We use rigorous verification processes on food production processes to ensure that claims made by food producers and processors are accurate. We care about food and other agricultural products, how it is grown and raised, the quality of what we eat, what farmers and ranchers do, and authentically telling that story to the consumer. Our team visits farms and ranches and looks at their plants, animals, and records, and compares the information we collect to specific standards or claims that farms and ranches want to make about how they are producing food. Our customers include top-tier players in the food and wine space.

The Company also provides sustainability programs, compliance management and farming information management solutions to drive sustainable value creation. We employ a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) revenue model that bundles annual software licenses with ongoing software enhancements and upgrades and a wide range of professional services that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry.
 
The Company’s business benefits from growing demand by consumers, retailers and government for increased transparency into food production practices.
 
Consumers: Due to concerns about food safety, animal welfare and an overall increase in health consciousness, consumers are demanding more information about the food they purchase.
 
Retailers: Responding to consumer demands for increased transparency as well as to the negative impact food scandals have on their bottom lines, retailers are requiring their suppliers to adhere to more stringent traceability and verification of product claims.
 
Government Regulation: The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Disease Traceability program, being phased in over the next few years, gluten-free testing requirements, and ingredient labeling regulations are all impacting product verification.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Due to organic growth in our portfolio of auditing standards, consumer demand and acquisitions, our sales have grown rapidly from $1.1 million in 2006 to $17.8 million in 2018, a 12-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 26%.
 
Our growth strategy is as follows:


● | To cover more food groups than does any other verification provider. Currently we verify beef, lamb, pork, poultry, dairy, eggs, produce, grain and finished products. In the future, we hope to include seafood, beverages and other produce. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To offer solutions for ALL participants in the food supply chain, including feed and input ingredient providers, farmers, producers, packers, auction barns, processors, handlers, distributors, restaurants, retailers and consumers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To expand on the industry’s largest solutions portfolio. We currently are verifying or certifying to more than 40 certification standards or guidelines. To our knowledge, that is the most in the industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue organic growth. We leverage our bundling capability to aggressively pursue new customers, while sustaining our recurring revenue model and high retention rates. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To continue growth through merger and acquisition opportunities. Through selective acquisitions, we can expand our footprint, add new services, food groups and revenue streams.

Acquisition of SureHarvest Services, LLC
 
On December 28, 2016, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “SureHarvest Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, SureHarvest Services LLC (the “Buyer” or “SureHarvest”); and SureHarvest, Inc., a California corporation (the “Seller”).
 
We purchased the business assets of the Seller in exchange for total consideration of approximately $2.66 million, comprised of approximately $1,122,000 in cash and 850,852 shares of common stock of WFCF valued at approximately $1,534,900 on December 28, 2016. Additionally, we issued the Seller a 40% membership interest in SureHarvest, with the Company holding a 60% membership interest. The Company has the right of first refusal on the remaining 40% of the outstanding membership interests of SureHarvest, which owns the business assets of SureHarvest, Inc.

Following the thirty-six-month anniversary of the effective date of the SureHarvest Purchase Agreement, the Company shall have the option, but not the obligation, to purchase all the units (the 40% interest) of SureHarvest held by the Seller, and the Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to require the Company to purchase all the units of SureHarvest held by the Seller. The purchase price for the units shall be equal to the amount the selling holders of the units would be entitled to receive upon a liquidation of SureHarvest assuming all of the assets of SureHarvest are sold for a purchase price equal to the product of eight and half times trailing twelve-month earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined, subject to an $8 million ceiling. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not exercised its call option.
 
SureHarvest develops software and provides services related to sustainability measurement and benchmarking, traceability, verification and certification to the food and agriculture industries. Its patented sustainability software solutions support more than 2,200 agri-food operations, including growers, packers, shippers, processors, wineries and trade associations. We believe that SureHarvest provides us with complementary solutions and services, a unique customer base and a valuable patent portfolio. It expands and diversifies our commodity reach with high value specialty crops, including wine grapes, almonds, hazelnuts, mushrooms, cut flowers, leafy greens and other fresh produce. Additionally, the SaaS model bundles annual software subscriptions with professional services to provide predictable, recurring revenue.
 
Acquisition of A Bee Organic LLC 
 
On May 30, 2017, we acquired the business assets of A Bee Organic LLC (“A Bee Organic”) for $150,000 in cash and 45,684 shares of common stock of WFCF valued at approximately $98,000 based on the closing price of our stock on May 30, 2017, of $2.15 per share. The acquisition primarily consisted of the existing customer relationships and represents further expansion of our verification and certification solutions into hydroponics/aquaponics and apiary spaces.
 
Acquisition of Sow Organic, LLC
 
On May 16, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Sow Organic, LLC, for $450,000 in cash and 217,654 shares of common stock of WFCF valued at approximately $433,100 based on the closing price of our stock on May 16, 2018, of $1.99 per share. We believe the transaction adds complementary solutions and services. Sow Organic’s software as a service (SaaS) model allows organic certification bodies to automate and accelerate new customer onboarding by converting traditional paper-based processes to digital format, resulting in lower costs, improved workflow management and increased productivity. Sow Organic’s unique design allows certification bodies to digitize any certification scheme. Likewise, the software affords producers and handlers a more efficient way to become certified and to digitally manage their records on an ongoing basis, including completing annual certification requirements fully online. We intend to further develop the organic business opportunity and collaborate on a broader rollout of the solution to other certification markets where the tool is equally suited to improve efficiencies and reduce costs in the certification process. This transaction further strengthens our intellectual property portfolio, which we believe represents a distinct competitive advantage for the Company.
 
Acquisition of JVF Consulting, LLC
 
On August 30, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of JVF Consulting, LLC (“Seller” or “JVF”), for $500,000 in cash and 158,437 shares of common stock of WFCF valued at approximately $315,300 based on the closing price of our stock on August 29, 2018, of $1.99 per share. We believe the transaction adds value to certain of our existing software solutions which are based on intellectual property built and owned by the Seller. JVF is currently the largest technology provider to our SureHarvest division. With this acquisition, WFCF controls the intellectual property associated with its current Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. Additionally, WFCF employed three of the Seller’s employees who enhance our ability to address new markets and services with our SaaS Solutions.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND 
 
The value-added food industry has been growing rapidly for the past several years in response to increased consumer interest about food production practices. We continue to see a growing interest from consumers regarding how their food is produced. We are in an increasingly global food market with food products traveling around the world, and brands differentiating themselves in the market. These key drivers are increasing the number of food labeling claims made on food products.
 
Natural and/or organic are examples of food labels that indicate that the food or other agricultural product has been produced in a certain way. Natural and organic sales are only part of the story of how consumers look for the verification of practices tied to food labeling claims. Other factors are also becoming increasingly more important to consumers, evidenced on menus and product labels. While not an exhaustive list, some of the issues that farms, ranches, producers, processors, restaurants and retailers are addressing include how animals are cared for and handled, how a product’s production impacts the environment and societies, and what inputs were used in the production of food items (like antibiotics).
 
As consumers want more assurance about the trustworthiness of labeling claims, there is a growing trend for verification of raising practices. Additionally, as the agriculture, livestock and food industries continue to mature and expand internationally, there is an increasing need to record, manage, report and verify information regarding the source, age, genetic background, animal treatment, nutrition, and other credence attributes. We believe verification of labeling claims by an independent third-party can meet consumer demands and expectations. Third-party verification also benefits producers, processors, distributors, restaurants, and retailers by addressing marketplace differentiation and global competitiveness.
 
Current Marketplace Opportunities 
 
Because of growing demand for increased transparency into food production practices, we believe there are three main market drivers to promote forward momentum for our business:
 
Market Driver #1 - Consumer awareness and expectations
 

● | Per the August 2017 edition of Global Organic Food Market produced by TechSci Research, the global organic food market stood at $110.25 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 16.15%, in value terms, during 2017 – 2022, to reach $262.85 billion by 2022. Growing awareness regarding health benefits of organic food consumption, rising per capita spending on organic food products and increasing health concerns due to the growing number of chemical poisoning cases are expected to drive global organic food market in the coming years. In addition, continuing product innovations and aggressive marketing strategies adopted by major players and online retailers would positively influence the global organic food market during forecast period. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Per the 2018 U.S. Grocery Shopper Trends produced by the Food Marketing Institute, shoppers evaluate a food retailer by how well it supports an overarching goal of eating well. Eating well means meeting one’s needs, pleasures and values through food experiences delivering health, taste or discovery and mindful connections. As consumers navigate a landscape of increasing choice around their sources for food, shopping well has come to mean more than just meeting eating needs within budget. Shopping well affords engagement with food discovery and ethical sourcing, even as it prompts shoppers to evolve their eating well aspirations. Shoppers continue to look “beyond the shelf” in their purchase decisions. Grass-fed beef has seen more engagement since last year’s study, as have local and fair-trade products, amidst an otherwise consistent picture of sustainable and ethical shopper behaviors. Shoppers also report a higher reliance on their food store to ensure food safety, with less reliance on the Food and Drug Administration. Consumers believe it is especially important for retailers to provide detailed information (transparency) about the products they sell.

Market Driver #2 - Global competitiveness among producers and retailers
 

● | Producers, restaurant chains and retailers with dominant market shares and large buying power, like Dannon, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, are leading the way in prioritizing sustainable food supply initiatives in response to consumer demands. With information literally at our fingertips, Google searches and smart phone apps are making it easier to expose where sustainable food supply chains are, and where they are not. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Producers, packers, distributors and retailers understand that verification, identification and traceability are key competitive differentiators. Oftentimes, it is necessary for export into international markets, including Korea, Russia, China and the European Union. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Driver #3 - Government regulation
 

● | The Animal Disease Traceability Rule promulgated by the USDA primarily covers beef cattle 18 months of age or older. Under the final rule, unless specifically exempted, livestock moved interstate must be officially identified and accompanied by an interstate certificate of veterinary inspection or other documentation, such as owner-shipper statements or brand certificates. Although animal disease traceability does not prevent disease, an efficient and accurate traceability system reduces the number of animals and response time involved in a disease investigation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cattle export verification (“EV”) requirements to China include source and age verification with the use of a program compliant ear tag. In addition, China bans the use of synthetic growth promotants, including ractopamine. So, although there is not a formal non-hormone component to the EV requirements for the supply chain, due to China’s residue testing, packers seek non-hormone treated cattle and/or verified natural cattle to ensure continued market access. China is the world’s second largest buyer of beef. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The development of the U.S. Hemp Authority Certified program demonstrates commitment toward high standards and transparency with hemp cultivation. The 2014 Farm Bill allowed farmers to start pilot programs for hemp alongside their agricultural programs. As of 2018, a new bill allows farmers to grow hemp with all the protections traditional farming receives. This Farm Bill allows farmers to legally grow hemp, which means more CBD products on the shelves. Through this bill, hemp will no longer be considered a controlled substance but rather take its place alongside all other types of traditional farming.

REVENUES 
 
We offer a wide array of services, including verification, certification, consulting and SaaS, to help food producers, brands and consumers differentiate certain attributes and production methods in the marketplace. We sell our services directly to customers at various levels in the agriculture, food and livestock supply chain. Most of our service offerings can be bundled to provide a “one-stop shop” for customers that have multiple levels of verification and certification needs, such as source verification and food safety certification. Our customers include some of the largest U.S. beef and pork packers, organic producers and processors, and specialty retail chains. No single customer generated more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue in 2018 or 2017.
 
With each acquisition, we assess the need to disclose discrete information related to our operating segments. Because of the similarities of certain of our acquisitions that provide certification and verification services, we aggregate operations into one verification and certification reportable segment. The operating segments included in the aggregated verification and certification segment include IMI Global, ICS and Validus. The factors considered in determining this aggregated reporting segment include the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of services provided, production processes, types of customers and distribution methods.

The Company also determined that it has a software sales and related consulting reportable segment. SureHarvest, which includes Sow Organic and JVF Consulting, is the sole operating segment. This segment includes software license, maintenance, support and software-related consulting service revenues.
 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Company’s CEO) allocates resources and assesses the performance of its operating segments. Segment management makes decisions, measures performance, and manages the business utilizing internal operating segment information. Performance of operating segments are based on net sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and most importantly, operating income.
 
Verification and Certification Segment
 
Our verification and certification service revenues consist of fees charged for verification audits and other verification and certification related services that the Company performs for customers. We include fees earned from our WFCF labeling program and consulting/program development services in our verification and certification revenues due to the immateriality of the revenue stream and because it represents a value-added extension of our source verification. We are recognized and utilized by numerous standard-setting bodies as an accredited verification or certification service provider. We enable food producers and brands to make certain claims on live animals or packaged food products by verifying that they are meeting the standards or guidelines associated with the claim(s) they are making. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our third-party verification programs provided 77.2% and 79.8% of our total revenue, respectively.
 
Our product sales are an ancillary part of our verification and certification services and represent sales of cattle identification ear tags. While our product sales have lower profit margins than do our proprietary offerings, the products allow us to offer our customers a comprehensive solution. Approximately 12.7% and 11.1% of our total revenue was generated by the sale of hardware during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Software Sales and Related Consulting Segment
 
Software license, maintenance and support services represents a SaaS revenue model that bundles annual software licenses with ongoing software customizations, enhancements and upgrades and a wide range of professional services that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry.
 
Software-related consulting service revenue represents fees earned from professional appearances, customer education and training related services.
 
MARKETING
 
Our marketing strategy includes direct marketing, advertising, event sponsorship, and trade show participation. From a public relations perspective, members of our staff are frequently quoted in industry trade journals and requested as speakers at various industry events as subject matter experts on the topics of animal identification, traceability, branding, third-party verification and certification, and the USDA verification programs.
 
In order to reach additional customers, we continually develop strategic marketing partnerships with leading companies in the industry with complementary abilities and products. We do not currently rely on any third-party contracts with distributors, licensors or manufacturers in conducting our business.
 
We also use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to help promote our business, market our product offerings, and connect consumers with current topics in the agriculture, livestock and food industries.

COMPETITION 
 
The competition for third-party verification services in the food and agriculture industry is growing more intense, especially within the organic market. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that there are approximately eight key competitors serving the food and agricultural industry, including Quality Assurance International, California Certified Organic Farmers, Oregon Tilth, Organic Crop Improvement Association, Earth Claims, FoodChain ID, NSF International, SGS and SCS Global Services. Differentiation hinges upon understanding all facets of food verification and the complex compliance challenges to make product verifications efficient, cost-effective, and seamless. Our core business and expertise focus on the “on farm” verifications to a variety of standards, guidelines and criteria, including source verification, natural, animal care and well-being, and sustainability verification.
SEASONALITY
 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of our verification and certification service revenue is typically realized during late May through early October when the calf marketings and the growing seasons are at their peak. Because of the seasonality of the business and our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We create, own and maintain a variety of intellectual property assets that we believe are among our most valuable assets. Our intellectual property assets include patents and patent applications related to our innovations, products and services, trademarks related to our brands, products and services, and other property rights. We also have licensing arrangements when features from our programs are desirable to incorporate into either a new or an existing technology we offer. We seek to protect our intellectual property right assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws of the United States and other countries, and through contractual provisions. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 63 total employees, of which 57 were full-time employees. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the performance of our key senior management personnel, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our employees is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
