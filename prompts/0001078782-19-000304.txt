Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Axim Biotechnologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an innovative biotechnology company focusing on research, development and production of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products, and extraction and purification of cannabinoids technologies based on our proprietary technologies. We believe to be setting the standard for cannabinoid bioscience through the discovery and commercialization of new materials and technologies for healthy living. Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the symbol “AXIM.”
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010 under the name AXIM International, Inc. On July 24, 2014, we changed our name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. to better reflect our business operations. On August 7, 2014, we incorporated a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary named Axim Holdings, Inc. to help facilitate the business operations of the Company.
 
On May 11, 2015, we entered into a 50 year, worldwide, exclusive intellectual property licensing agreement (“Agreement”) with CanChew Biotechnologies, LLC (“CanChew”). As compensation for the Agreement, CanChew received 5,826,706 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock and a royalty fee of approximately 2-3% of all gross sales derived from products produced under the Agreement. So long as we are in compliance with the Agreement, we have the option to purchase the licensed intellectual property after 5 years at a purchase price equal to fifty percent (50%) of the annual royalty fee paid.
 
In October 2017, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands for purposes of holding pharmaceutical licenses as required by the Netherlands regulations and laws. 
 
Our principal corporate headquarters are located at 45 Rockefeller Plaza, 20th Floor, Suite 83, New York, New York 10111. Our website address is www.aximbiotech.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of this prospectus. The trademarks, trade names and service marks appearing in this prospectus are the property of their respective owners.
 
Current Operations
    
The operations of the Company include: the research and development of pharmaceutical products, and extraction and purification of cannabinoids technologies. Over the next 12 months, we anticipate the following activities:
   
Development of a bioequivalent to Marinol product for treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and lack of appetite in HIV/ AIDS patients based on proprietary controlled-release functional chewing gum delivery platform. This product will lead to a NDA according to 505(b)2 regulatory pathway according to a pIND meeting with the FDA.


Development and commercialization of products pending Phase I and II clinical trials for Restless Leg Syndrome.


Conducting a clinical trial at the Free University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands for a novel, patented controlled-release delivery form of cannabinoids for treatment of chronic pain and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. The anticipated duration of the trials prior to FDA/ EMA registration is 12 to18 months.
   
Conducting a clinical trial at the University of British Columbia, Canada on patients suffering of illicit drug-related psychosis using innovative, (patented) delivery mechanisms containing cannabinoids. This trial is awaiting approval by Health Canada and will result in an NDA.

During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) filing Exchange Act reports, (ii) contractual obligations, (iii) clinical trials, and (iv) continued research and development of pharmaceutical formulations.

We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our shareholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, we have limited cash. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.
 
We are in our early stages of development and growth, without established records of sales or earnings. We will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
 
Research and Development
 
We are continuing our research and development at the Free University of Amsterdam with our novel (patent pending) delivery system for treatment of patients with pain and spasticity as a sequence of Multiple Sclerosis. The study is conducted in strict compliance with FDA/ EMA guidelines and is supervised by QPS as a CRO. The product tested is a pharmaceutical, functional chewing gum containing equal parts of THC and CBD. With our proprietary technology numerous problems related to cannabinoid’ water-insolubility due to its lipophilic nature, first-pass liver metabolism and direct delivery into the systemic circulation has been resolved.
 
Phase I and II trial in patients with Restless Leg Syndrome will be conducted in Israel in strict adherence to FDA guidelines. The study is anticipated to commence in April of 2019 and will test a combination cannabinoid/ gabapentin product based on AXIM’ proprietary delivery format.
 
Phase I and II clinical trial for treatment of patients affected by drug-related psychosis will commence at the University of British Columbia, Canada utilizing cannabinoids in a proprietary delivery formulation.
 
 New, patent pending cannabinoid extraction techniques as well as pure, water soluble, freeze-dried cannabinoids are being developed in cooperation with Syncom, BV, The Netherlands, which practically solves the issue with very poor absorption of currently available, oil-based cannabinoids.
 
There are numerous other R&D projects being considered involving our proprietary intellectual property. These will be strategically planned depending on availability of funds to carry on.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our pending patent applications include twelve (12) patent applications for oral care compositions, sugar alcohol kneading method, antimicrobial compositions, extraction method, cosmetic, nicotine dependence treatment gum, opioid dependence treatment gum, restless leg treatment gum, suppositories, method to treat psoriasis, method to treat atopic dermatitis, and method to treat vitiligo. Twelve (12) of our patent applications have entered non-provisional stage in the U.S. and/or international stage and/or national stages in other jurisdictions. Our patents include five (5) patents for toothpaste compositions, ophthalmic solutions, method to use the ophthalmic solution to treat glaucoma and conjunctivitis, method to extract THC, and suppository compositions; and one (1) licensed patent (chewing gum containing cannabinoids, covering all cannabinoids, including THC). Continuation applications for oral care compositions, method to extract THC, and suppository compositions have been filed, these pending applications are indicated above. We are in the process of developing and filing more patent applications.
 
We have twenty seven (27) trademark applications some of which are registered trademarks, received Notices of Allowance, or pending in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office or other jurisdictions: A Axim Biotech, Axim, Cannanimals, CanQuit, CannaCoal, CanChui, CanShu, Oraximax, ReneCann, CannBleph, OpthoCann, Cannonich, Cannocyn, HempChew, SuppoCann, CanChew, CanChew Hemp CBD Gum, CanChew RX, CanChew Plus, CanQuit OC, CanChew +, CanChew +10, CanChew +50, CanChew +100, MedChew, MedChew GP, MedChew RL. Corresponding trademark applications have been filed in other jurisdictions for some of the marks and have received registration or are pending. 
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products focusing on diseases and conditions for which currently there are no known efficient therapeutic ingredients or delivery systems for known active pharmaceutical ingredients. The body of knowledge regarding therapeutic use of cannabinoid-based formulations is steadily increasing. We plan to be an active player in this field of biosciences with our extensive R&D and pipeline of innovative products.

Our target customers are primarily end consumers via Internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufacturers of products that can readily replace their raw base materials with our materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Next, we will target retail stores with major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.
 
Competition
 
There are many developers of hemp-based consumer products, many of which are under-capitalized which we consider to be viable acquisition targets. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based products but may do so in the future.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company currently has arrangements with multiple reputable suppliers which are expected to meet the projected needs for materials for the upcoming year. These suppliers are based in The Netherlands.
Government Regulation
 
On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law. The law went into effect on January 1st, 2019. 
 
As a consequence of the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp has now been permanently removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). It is now deemed an agricultural commodity, no longer able to be classified as a controlled substance, like marijuana. Furthermore, by redefining hemp to include its “extracts, cannabinoids and derivatives,” Congress explicitly removed popular hemp products – such as hemp-derived CBD — from the purview of the CSA. 
 
Accordingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products, so as long as the THC level is at or below 0.3%. State and Tribal governments may impose separate restrictions or requirements on hemp growth and the sale of hemp products. However, they cannot interfere with the interstate transport of hemp or hemp products.
 
We believe that the 2018 Farm Bill should give comfort to federally regulated institutions, pharmacies, banks, merchant services, credit card companies, e-commerce sites and advertising platforms, to conduct commerce with the hemp and hemp CBD industry.
 
On September 27, 2018, the Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration announced that Epidiolex, the newly approved medication by the Food & Drug Administration, is being placed in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act, the least restrictive schedule of the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the “CSA”). On June 26 2018, the FDA announced it approved Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. Epidiolex contains cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical constituent of the cannabis plant (commonly referred to as marijuana). The CBD in Epidiolex is extracted from the cannabis plant and is the first FDA-approved drug to contain a purified extract from the plant. Schedule V drugs represents the least potential for abuse. Schedule V drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with lower potential for abuse than Schedule IV and consist of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. Schedule V drugs are generally used for antidiarrheal, antitussive, and analgesic purposes. Some examples of Schedule V drugs are: cough preparations with less than 200 milligrams of codeine or per 100 milliliters (Robitussin AC), Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, Parepectolin.
 
Despite the approvals by the FDA and DEA for Epidiolex, any of these foregoing factors, many of which are beyond our control, could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market our planned products. Moreover, because our business is almost entirely dependent upon these product candidates, any such setback in our pursuit of regulatory approval would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.
 
Employees
 
As of April 8, 2019, we have 4 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. We allow and utilize the services of independent contractors. We will be considering the conversion of some of our part-time employees to full-time positions. We are currently in discussions with qualified individuals to engage them for positions in sales and marketing, research and development, and operations. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
