Item 1 | Business

The Company and its Subsidiaries
National Fuel Gas Company (the Registrant), incorporated in 1902, is a holding company organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey. The Registrant owns directly or indirectly all of the outstanding securities of its subsidiaries. Reference to “the Company” in this report means the Registrant, the Registrant and its subsidiaries or the Registrant’s subsidiaries as appropriate in the context of the disclosure. Also, all references to a certain year in this report relate to the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30 of that year unless otherwise noted.
The Company is a diversified energy company engaged principally in the production, gathering, transportation, distribution and marketing of natural gas. The Company operates an integrated business, with assets centered in western New York and Pennsylvania, being used for, and benefiting from, the production and transportation of natural gas from the Appalachian basin. Current natural gas production development activities are focused in the Marcellus and Utica Shales, geological shale formations that are present nearly a mile or more below the surface in the Appalachian region of the United States. Pipeline development activities are designed to transport natural gas production to new and growing markets. The common geographic footprint of the Company’s subsidiaries enables them to share management, labor, facilities and support services across various businesses and pursue coordinated projects designed to produce and transport natural gas from the Appalachian basin to markets in Canada and the eastern United States. The Company also develops and produces oil reserves, primarily in California. The Company reports financial results for four business segments: Exploration and Production, Pipeline and Storage, Gathering and Utility.
1. The Exploration and Production segment operations are carried out by Seneca Resources Company, LLC (Seneca), a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Seneca is engaged in the exploration for, and the development and production of, natural gas and oil reserves in California and in the Appalachian region of the United States. At September 30, 2019, Seneca had U.S. proved developed and undeveloped reserves of 24,873 Mbbl of oil and 2,949,519 MMcf of natural gas.
2. The Pipeline and Storage segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (Supply Corporation), a Pennsylvania corporation, and Empire Pipeline, Inc. (Empire), a New York corporation. Supply Corporation provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for affiliated and nonaffiliated companies through (i) an integrated gas pipeline system extending from southwestern Pennsylvania to the New York-Canadian border at the Niagara River and eastward to Ellisburg and Leidy, Pennsylvania and Tuscarora, New York, and (ii) 28 underground natural gas storage fields owned and operated by Supply Corporation as well as three other underground natural gas storage fields owned and operated jointly with other interstate gas pipeline companies. Empire transports and stores natural gas for major industrial companies, utilities (including Distribution Corporation) and power producers in New York State. Empire also transports natural gas for natural gas marketers and exploration and production companies from natural gas producing areas in Pennsylvania to markets in New York and to interstate pipeline delivery points with access to additional markets in the northeastern United States and Canada. Empire owns the Empire Pipeline, a 266-mile pipeline system comprising four principal components: a 157-mile pipeline that extends from the United States/Canadian border at the Niagara River near Buffalo, New York to near Syracuse, New York; a 77-mile pipeline extension from near Rochester, New York to an interconnection with the unaffiliated Millennium Pipeline near Corning, New York (the Empire Connector); a 15-mile pipeline extension from Corning into Tioga County, Pennsylvania (the Tioga County Extension); and a 17-mile pipeline extension between Empire's pipeline system and Supply Corporation's system at Tuscarora, New York. 
3. The Gathering segment operations are carried out by wholly-owned subsidiaries of National Fuel Gas Midstream Company, LLC (Midstream Company), a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Through these subsidiaries, Midstream Company builds, owns and operates natural gas processing and pipeline gathering facilities in the Appalachian region.
4. The Utility segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution Corporation), a New York corporation. Distribution Corporation provides natural gas utility services to 
--

approximately 743,400 customers through a local distribution system located in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The principal metropolitan areas served by Distribution Corporation include Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Jamestown, New York and Erie and Sharon, Pennsylvania.
Financial information about each of the Company’s business segments can be found in Item 7, MD&A and also in Item 8 at Note K — Business Segment Information.
Seneca’s Northeast Division is included in the Company's All Other category. This division markets timber from Appalachian land holdings. At September 30, 2019, the Company owned approximately 95,000 acres of timber property and managed approximately 2,500 additional acres of timber cutting rights.
National Fuel Resources, Inc. (NFR) is included in the Company’s All Other category. NFR is the Company’s energy marketing subsidiary, which markets gas to industrial, wholesale, commercial, public authority and residential customers in western and central New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. Additional discussion concerning the elimination of NFR as a reporting segment can be found in Item 8 at Note K — Business Segment Information. 
No single customer, or group of customers under common control, accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2019.
Rates and Regulation
The Utility segment’s rates, services and other matters are regulated by the NYPSC with respect to services provided within New York and by the PaPUC with respect to services provided within Pennsylvania. For additional discussion of the Utility segment’s rates and regulation, see Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Rate and Regulatory Matters” and Item 8 at Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Regulatory Mechanisms) and Note D — Regulatory Matters.
The Pipeline and Storage segment’s rates, services and other matters are regulated by the FERC. For additional discussion of the Pipeline and Storage segment’s rates and regulation, see Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Rate and Regulatory Matters” and Item 8 at Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Regulatory Mechanisms) and Note D — Regulatory Matters.
The discussion under Item 8 at Note D — Regulatory Matters includes a description of the regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with applicable accounting standards. To the extent that the criteria set forth in such accounting standards are not met by the operations of the Utility segment or the Pipeline and Storage segment, as the case may be, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be eliminated from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and such accounting treatment would be discontinued.
In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to the same federal, state and local regulations on various subjects, including environmental matters, to which other companies doing similar business in the same locations are subject.
The Exploration and Production Segment
The Exploration and Production segment contributed approximately 36.7% of the Company's 2019 net income available for common stock. 
Additional discussion of the Exploration and Production segment appears below in this Item 1 under the headings “Sources and Availability of Raw Materials” and “Competition: The Exploration and Production Segment,” in Item 7, MD&A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The Pipeline and Storage Segment
The Pipeline and Storage segment contributed approximately 24.3% of the Company's 2019 net income available for common stock. 
Supply Corporation’s firm transportation capacity is subject to change as the market identifies different transportation paths and receipt/delivery point combinations. At the end of fiscal year 2019, Supply Corporation 
--

had firm transportation service agreements and leases for approximately 3,078 MDth per day (contracted transportation capacity). The Utility segment accounts for approximately 1,144 MDth per day or 37% of contracted transportation capacity, and the Exploration and Production segment and NFR operations (included in the All Other category) represent another 166 MDth per day or 5%. Additionally, Supply Corporation leases 55 MDth per day or 2% of its firm transportation capacity to Empire. The remaining 1,713 MDth or 56% is subject to firm contracts or leases with nonaffiliated customers. Contracted transportation capacity with both affiliated and nonaffiliated shippers is expected to remain relatively constant in fiscal 2020.
Supply Corporation had service agreements and leases for all of its firm storage capacity, totaling 70,693 MDth, at the end of 2019. The Utility segment has contracted for 28,491 MDth or 40% of the total firm storage capacity, and the Company's NFR operations accounted for another 2,644 MDth or 4%. Additionally, Supply Corporation leases 3,753 MDth or 5% of its firm storage capacity to Empire. Nonaffiliated customers have contracted for the remaining 35,805 MDth or 51%. Supply Corporation expects contracted storage services totaling approximately 4,192 MDth to terminate and be remarketed in fiscal 2020.
At the end of fiscal 2019, Empire had service agreements in place for firm transportation capacity totaling up to approximately 853 MDth per day, with 91% of that capacity contracted as long-term, full-year deals. The Utility segment accounted for 4% of Empire’s firm contracted capacity, with the remaining 96% subject to contracts with nonaffiliated customers. Empire expects that no long-term contracts will expire or terminate in fiscal 2020.
Empire’s firm storage capacity, totaling 3,753 MDth, was fully contracted at the end of fiscal 2019. The total storage capacity is contracted on a long-term basis, with a nonaffiliated customer. The contract will not expire or terminate in fiscal 2020.
The majority of Supply Corporation’s transportation and storage contracts, and the majority of Empire’s transportation contracts, allow either party to terminate the contract upon six or twelve months’ notice effective at the end of the primary term, and include “evergreen” language that allows for annual term extension(s). Empire's storage contract contains similar termination and "evergreen" language.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The Exploration and Production segment seeks to discover and produce raw materials (natural gas, oil and hydrocarbon liquids) as further described in this report in Item 7, MD&A and Item 8 at Note K — Business Segment Information and Note M — Supplementary Information for Oil and Gas Producing Activities.
The Pipeline and Storage segment transports and stores natural gas owned by its customers, whose gas originates in the southwestern, mid-continent and Appalachian regions of the United States as well as in Canada. Additional discussion of proposed pipeline projects appears below under “Competition: The Pipeline and Storage Segment” and in Item 7, MD&A.
The Gathering segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas that is produced by Seneca in the Appalachian region of the United States. Additional discussion of proposed gathering projects appears below in Item 7, MD&A.
Natural gas is the principal raw material for the Utility segment. In 2019, the Utility segment purchased 78.6 Bcf of gas (including 74.0 Bcf for delivery to retail customers and 4.6 Bcf used in operations). Gas purchased from producers and suppliers in the United States under firm contracts (seasonal and longer) accounted for 51% of these purchases. Purchases of gas on the spot market (contracts of one month or less) accounted for 49% of the Utility segment’s 2019 purchases. Purchases from DTE Energy Trading, Inc. (29%), NextEra Energy Marketing, LLC (13%), J. Aron & Company (8%), Shell Energy North America US (7%) and SWN Energy Services Company LLC (7%) accounted for 64% of the Utility’s 2019 gas purchases. No other producer or supplier provided the Utility segment with more than 5% of its gas requirements in 2019.
Competition
Competition in the natural gas industry exists among providers of natural gas, as well as between natural gas and other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and electricity. Management believes that the environmental advantages of natural gas have enhanced its competitive position relative to other fuels.
The Company competes on the basis of price, service and reliability, product performance and other factors. Sources and providers of energy, other than those described under this “Competition” heading, do not compete with the Company to any significant extent.
Competition: The Exploration and Production Segment
The Exploration and Production segment competes with other oil and natural gas producers and marketers with respect to sales of oil and natural gas. The Exploration and Production segment also competes, by competitive bidding and otherwise, with other oil and natural gas producers with respect to exploration and development prospects and mineral leaseholds.
To compete in this environment, Seneca originates and acts as operator on its prospects, seeks to minimize the risk of exploratory efforts through partnership-type arrangements, utilizes technology for both exploratory studies and drilling operations, and seeks market niches based on size, operating expertise and financial criteria.
Competition: The Pipeline and Storage Segment
Supply Corporation competes for market growth in the natural gas market with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeast United States and with other companies providing gas storage services. Supply Corporation has some unique characteristics which enhance its competitive position. Most of Supply Corporation’s facilities are in or near areas overlying the Marcellus and Utica Shale production areas in Pennsylvania, and it has established interconnections with producers and other pipelines to access these supplies. Its facilities are also located adjacent to the Canadian border at the Niagara River providing access to markets in Canada and the northeastern and midwestern United States via the TC Energy pipeline system. Supply Corporation has developed and placed into service a number of pipeline expansion projects designed to transport natural gas to key markets in New York, Pennsylvania, the northeastern United States, Canada, and to long-haul pipelines with access to the U.S. Midwest and the gulf coast. For further discussion of Pipeline and Storage projects, refer to Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Investing Cash Flow.”

Empire competes for natural gas market growth with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeast United States and upstate New York in particular. Empire is well situated to provide transportation of Appalachian shale gas as well as gas supplies available at Empire’s interconnect with TC Energy at Chippawa. Empire’s geographic location provides it the opportunity to compete for service to its on-system LDC markets, as well as for a share of the gas transportation markets into Canada (via Chippawa) and into the northeastern United States. The Empire Connector, along with other subsequent projects, has expanded Empire’s footprint and capability, allowing Empire to serve new markets in New York and elsewhere in the Northeast, and to attach to prolific Marcellus and Utica supplies principally from Tioga and Bradford Counties in Pennsylvania. Like Supply Corporation, Empire’s expanded system facilitates transportation of shale gas to key markets within New York State, the northeastern United States and Canada.
Competition: The Gathering Segment
The Gathering segment provides gathering services for Seneca’s production and competes with other companies that gather and process natural gas in the Appalachian region.
Competition: The Utility Segment
With respect to gas commodity service, in New York and Pennsylvania, both of which have implemented “unbundling” policies that allow customers to choose their gas commodity supplier, Distribution Corporation has retained a substantial majority of small sales customers. In both New York and Pennsylvania, approximately 14% of Distribution Corporation’s small-volume residential and commercial customers purchase their supplies from unregulated marketers. In contrast, almost all large-volume load is served by unregulated retail marketers. However, retail competition for gas commodity service does not pose an acute competitive threat for Distribution Corporation, because in both jurisdictions, utility cost of service is recovered through rates and charges for gas delivery service, not gas commodity service. 
Competition for transportation service to large-volume customers continues with local producers or pipeline companies attempting to sell or transport gas directly to end-users located within the Utility segment’s service territories without use of the utility’s facilities (i.e., bypass). In addition, while competition with fuel oil suppliers exists, recent commodity pricing has enhanced the competitive position of natural gas.
The Utility segment competes in its most vulnerable markets (the large commercial and industrial markets) by offering unbundled, flexible, high quality services. The Utility segment continues to advance programs promoting the use of natural gas.
Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation in jurisdictions that impact the Utility segment. New York, for example, adopted the Climate Leadership & Community Protection Act (CLCPA) in July 2019, which could ultimately result in increased competition from electric and geothermal forms of energy. However, given the extended time frames associated with the CLCPA's emission reduction mandates as discussed in Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Environmental Matters” and subheading “Environmental Regulation,” any meaningful competition resulting from the CLCPA cannot be determined.
Seasonality
Variations in weather conditions can materially affect the volume of natural gas delivered by the Utility segment, as virtually all of its residential and commercial customers use natural gas for space heating. The effect that this has on Utility segment margins in New York is mitigated by a WNC, which covers the eight-month period from October through May. Weather that is warmer than normal results in an upward adjustment to customers’ current bills, while weather that is colder than normal results in a downward adjustment, so that in either case projected operating costs calculated at normal temperatures will be recovered.
Volumes transported and stored by Supply Corporation and by Empire may vary significantly depending on weather, without materially affecting the revenues of those companies. Supply Corporation’s and Empire’s allowed rates are based on a straight fixed-variable rate design which allows recovery of fixed costs in fixed monthly 
--

reservation charges. Variable charges based on volumes are designed to recover only the variable costs associated with actual transportation or storage of gas.
Capital Expenditures
A discussion of capital expenditures by business segment is included in Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Investing Cash Flow.”
Environmental Matters
A discussion of material environmental matters involving the Company is included in Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Environmental Matters” and in Item 8, Note J — Commitments and Contingencies.
Miscellaneous
The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries had a total of 2,107 full-time employees at September 30, 2019. 
The Company has agreements in place with collective bargaining units in New York and Pennsylvania. Agreements covering employees in collective bargaining units in New York are scheduled to expire in February 2021. Agreements covering employees in collective bargaining units in Pennsylvania are scheduled to expire in April 2022. 
The Utility segment has numerous municipal franchises under which it uses public roads and certain other rights-of-way and public property for the location of facilities. When necessary, the Utility segment renews such franchises.
The Company makes its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on the Company’s internet website, www.nationalfuelgas.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information available at the Company’s internet website is not part of this Form 10-K or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC.
