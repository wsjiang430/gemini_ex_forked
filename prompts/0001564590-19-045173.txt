 MEDICAL DEVICE SEGMENT
 Advances in medical device technology have helped drive improved device efficacy and patient outcomes. The convergence of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries, often made possible by surface coatings and device drug-delivery technologies (together, “surface modification coating technologies”), presents an opportunity for major advancements in the healthcare industry. We believe the benefits of combining drugs and biologics with implantable and minimally invasive devices are becoming increasingly valuable in applications in cardiology, peripheral vascular disease, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopedic and other large interventional markets. 
 In an effort to improve their existing products or develop entirely new devices, a growing number of medical device manufacturers are exploring or using surface modification coating technologies as product differentiators or device enablers. The continuing trend toward minimally invasive surgical procedures, which often employ catheter-based delivery technologies, has increased the demand for hydrophilic (i.e., lubricious or slippery) coatings and other coating technologies, including drug-delivery coatings. For example, stents, particularly drug-eluting stents, have significantly reduced the need for repeat intravascular procedures or more invasive cardiac bypass surgery. Drug-coated balloons (“DCBs”) have further transformed intravascular therapies by enhancing patient outcomes while not leaving stents in the vascular system. Transcatheter heart valve repair or replacement via a minimally invasive catheter-based system has enabled the treatment of patients suffering from heart valve disease who are too ill to undergo open-heart surgery. Positive clinical outcomes and acceptance by patients, physicians and insurance companies of such innovations has helped certain segments of the United States (“U.S.”) medical device industry grow at a faster pace than the economy as a whole. The attractiveness of the industry has drawn intense competition among the companies participating in this area. 
 For many years, we have provided surface modification coating technologies that impart lubricity, prohealing or biocompatibility characteristics, as well as drug delivery capabilities to enhance our customers’ medical devices and delivery systems. Since fiscal 2013, with our investment in our DCB platform, we have been focused on a strategy to develop and manufacture proprietary medical device products that combine our surface modification coatings with medical devices or delivery systems (“whole-product solutions”). We believe this strategy has and will continue to increase our relevance in the medical device 
 4

industry. The strategy is key to our future growth and profitability, given the prospect of capturing more revenue and operating margin with whole-product solutions as compared with device-enabling technologies. We also continue to develop and commercialize our surface modification coating technologies through license agreements with third party medical device manufacturers. 
 We have established our medical device design, development and manufacturing capabilities through internal projects and acquisitions over the past several years, with the goal of developing and commercializing at least 12 medical device products by the end of fiscal 2023. To that end, we have invested in state-of-the-art R&D and manufacturing facilities in Ireland and the U.S. and are leveraging our balloon catheter, ultra-thin-walled catheter, thrombectomy and surface modification coating technologies to develop new product platforms and medical device products with a primary focus on treatment of peripheral artery disease (“PAD”). Our aim is to develop highly differentiated medical devices that address unmet clinical needs, improve patient outcomes and reduce procedure costs. 
 We are also committed to developing or acquiring differentiated technology to support our medical device product development pipeline. In July 2019, the Company acquired an early-stage device technology with multiple potential peripheral vascular applications. In May 2018, we acquired an innovative thrombectomy platform technology with broad potential applications in peripheral vascular and other areas. These acquisitions resulted in acquired in-process R&D charges of $0.8 million and $7.9 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. We plan to leverage our design, development and manufacturing capabilities to advance these acquired technology platforms for a variety of peripheral vascular applications as part of our whole-product solutions strategy. 
 Overview of Interventional Peripheral Market and Whole-Product Solutions Strategy
 PAD is a condition that causes a narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the extremities, most often due to plaque buildup in the arterial walls. Left untreated, PAD may lead to symptoms such as large non-healing ulcers, infections, or gangrene, and may require limb amputation or, in extreme cases, result in death. 
 The American Heart Association has reported that an estimated 8.5 million Americans and 200 million people worldwide are living with PAD. The number of people affected by PAD is expected to increase as a result of an aging population, coupled with increasing prevalence of conditions linked to PAD, such as diabetes and obesity. The interventional PAD market utilizes a variety of access and therapy catheters to treat PAD. These technologies are delivered through a number of access points into the vascular system including femoral (leg), radial (wrist or arm) and pedal (foot).
 Our business model for our whole-product solutions strategy is to design, develop and manufacture highly differentiated products that incorporate our proprietary catheter, balloon, thrombectomy and surface modification coating technologies to improve patient outcomes and reduce procedure costs, while maintaining patient safety. We are focused on developing devices that consider the needs of various care settings ranging from hospitals to alternate care facilities, in order to provide improved care. The strategy has been built on our investment in proprietary device technologies, as well as state-of-the-art medical device design, development and manufacturing capabilities. Combined with our leadership in surface modification coating technologies, we are developing whole-product solutions to address unmet needs in the treatment of PAD and other vascular diseases. Over the past several years we have made investments to enhance our clinical and regulatory capabilities and in fiscal 2020, we intend to make additional investments to obtain clinical data and drive clinician engagement with our products after approval. These investments are intended to reduce the time from product development to commercialization and ensure our products have clinician support and adoption. Our development efforts to date have yielded several device technology platforms that we anticipate will compete in the interventional vascular market, with a primary focus on treatment of PAD.

Drug-coated balloons
 DCBs are currently used in a variety of vascular interventions and may be helpful in preventing restenosis, or the narrowing of vessels after treatment. Surmodics is focused on the development of DCB’s to treat PAD and the development of our SurVeil™ DCB to treat the superficial femoral artery over the past several years has been a major component of our whole-product solutions strategy. During fiscal 2016, we initiated PREVEIL, an early feasibility clinical trial of the SurVeil DCB, which is intended to treat PAD in the leg above the knee. Enrollment in PREVEIL was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating peak paclitaxel plasma concentrations post-index procedure. Consistent with pre-clinical data, systemic levels were low and cleared rapidly. Data from the PREVEIL study continues to demonstrate positive results and showed no clinically driven target lesion revascularization after 12 months. 
 We began enrollment in the TRANSCEND pivotal clinical trial for our SurVeil™ DCB in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with the objective of obtaining data necessary to support regulatory approvals and reimbursement for this device in the U.S. as well as CE Mark approval. Until regulatory approvals have been obtained, our SurVeil DCB is not approved for commercial sale. In August 2019 we completed enrollment in TRANSCEND. 
 On March 15, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued a communication (the “FDA communication”) to healthcare providers about the potential for increased long-term mortality after use of paclitaxel-coated balloons and paclitaxel-eluting stents (collectively “paclitaxel-coated products”) to treat peripheral arterial disease (“PAD”) in the femoropopliteal artery. The FDA communication updated a previous notification from the FDA on the same topic, which was in response to meta-analysis of randomized trials published in the Journal of the American Heart Association in December 2018.  As a result of the FDA communication and the potential long-term mortality signal related to the use of paclitaxel-coated devices, the regulatory body with which we applied for a Conformité Européenne Mark (“CE Mark”) to allow for commercialization of SurVeil in the European Union (“EU”) has notified us that they have temporarily paused review of submissions of paclitaxel-coated devices. This pause and the current regulatory debate over paclitaxel-coated devices have caused uncertainty regarding our goal of receiving a CE Mark by the end of calendar 2019 and subsequent commercialization of the product in fiscal 2020. As a result, we no longer expect revenue related to commercialization of this product in the EU or any associated milestones in fiscal 2020.
 In fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement with Abbott that provided Abbott with exclusive worldwide commercialization rights for the SurVeil DCB (the “Abbott Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Abbott Agreement, Surmodics received a $25 million upfront payment and a $10 million payment as a result of the completion of enrollment in the TRANSCEND trial.  Separately, Abbott also received options to negotiate agreements for Surmodics' below-the-knee and arteriovenous (“AV”) fistula DCB products, which are currently in pre-clinical development and a first-in-human clinical trial, respectively. We are collaborating with Abbott on product development, clinical trials and regulatory activities to obtain marketing clearances in the U.S. and the EU for the SurVeil DCB. Expenses related to these activities are primarily paid by Surmodics. In addition to the upfront and clinical trial milestone payments received to date, we may earn up to an additional $57 million upon achievement of certain other milestones related to regulatory approval and clinical trial activities. Upon the regulatory approval of the SurVeil DCB, Surmodics will be responsible for manufacturing clinical and commercial quantities of the product and will realize revenue from product sales to Abbott, as well as a share of profits resulting from sales to third parties.
 Our DCB product platform also includes our paclitaxel-coated Avess™ DCB for the treatment of AV fistulae and our sirolimus-coated Sundance™ DCB for the treatment of below-the-knee PAD, otherwise known as critical limb ischemia (“CLI”). We commenced and completed enrollment in a first in-human clinical study of our Avess DCB in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we froze the design of our Sundance DCB and submitted an application for a first in-human study of this device. We expect to commence this study in fiscal 2020. More than 3.5 million patients are estimated to be diagnosed with CLI in the U.S. by 2020. Rates of amputation and death are significant for CLI patients and there are currently no drug-delivery devices approved to treat the condition in the U.S. In October 2019, the FDA designated the Sundance DCB as a “Breakthrough Device” under the FDA’s Breakthrough Devices Program. The program, launched in December 2018, is designed to streamline the market clearance/approval process for products that have the potential to provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.
 Radial access devices and other specialty catheters
 Often, interventional vascular procedures require one or more devices to provide appropriate access and necessary support for the physician. Our integration of proprietary low-profile balloon catheter, ultra-thin-walled catheter, and surface modification coating technologies is generating a pipeline of highly differentiated medical devices that improve on currently available minimally-invasive PAD treatments, or in some cases offer an option for complex cases. Our specialty catheters are designed for high performance in challenging vascular anatomy, providing clinicians enhanced ability to access, cross and treat increasingly complex vascular lesions.

We are developing a series of devices designed to provide radial (wrist) access to the peripheral vasculature. Radial artery access, which has already been widely adopted for coronary applications, offers many benefits relative to traditional femoral artery access. These benefits include reduced bleeding complications, earlier ambulation and reduced length of stay and costs. We believe the integration of our catheter and coatings technologies will result in highly differentiated radial access devices intended to capture market share from standard femoral access devices.
During fiscal 2019, we received FDA clearance for the Sublime™ guide sheath, designed to enable the delivery of lower extremity interventions from the radial artery. We expect to continue to develop and pursue clearance for other radial access devices in our fiscal 2020, including our Sublime radial-access .014” PTA balloon catheter.
 Our specialty catheter portfolio has advanced with the execution of agreements with two leading, multi-national medical device companies to distribute our Telemark™ coronary/peripheral support microcatheter in the U.S. and Europe and our .014” and .018” low-profile percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (“PTA”) balloon dilation catheters on a worldwide basis. We expect to commence commercial sales of each of these products through our distribution partners in fiscal 2020.
 Thrombectomy
 Acute vascular occlusion, or the blocking of arteries by clots or plaque is another peripheral vascular condition commonly associated with PAD. Often, these clots require surgical intervention and have proven difficult to remove with currently available medical device technologies. A similar condition in the venous system, known as Venous Thromboembolism (“VTE”), includes both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. VTE has a high prevalence in the US and high overall and in-hospital mortality rates which causes strain on the U.S. healthcare system.
 We are leveraging our proprietary Pounce™ thrombectomy platform technology to develop products to treat these conditions in a more effective, cost-efficient manner. The Pounce technology is designed to remove difficult, organized (hard) blood clots that are often difficult for existing devices, and has potential applications in the peripheral vascular, neurology and coronary markets. The technology offers an innovative design that may reduce the need for the use of thrombolytics, lowering the likelihood of ICU time and bleeding complications that affect patient recovery and outcomes and increase the cost of treatment. Our goal with this technology is to reduce procedure time and eliminate the need for additional external capital equipment, thereby providing an easy-to-use, on-the-table solution for clinicians. We have submitted for FDA 510(k) clearance on our first Pounce thrombectomy device to treat vascular thrombosis and expect to receive clearance in fiscal 2020. Our goal is to expand our thrombectomy platform to include devices designed to treat deep vein thrombosis, as well as stroke and pulmonary embolism.
Overview of Surmodics’ Surface Modification Coating Technologies
 We believe Surmodics is positioned to take advantage of the continuing trend of incorporating surface modification coating technologies, particularly in the area of device drug-delivery, into the design of more efficient and effective combination products, as well as new product applications. We have a growing proprietary technology portfolio that incorporates our market expertise and insight, as well as unique collaborative research, development and manufacturing capabilities—key ingredients to bring innovation together to benefit patients and the healthcare industry.
Coatings for Surface Modification and Device Drug Delivery
 Key differentiating characteristics of our coating platforms are their flexibility, durability and ease of use. In terms of flexibility, coatings can be applied to many different kinds of surfaces and can immobilize a variety of chemical, pharmaceutical and biological agents. Additionally, the surface modification process can be tailored to provide customers with the ability to improve their devices’ performance by choosing the specific coating properties desired for particular applications. Our surface modification coating technologies also can be combined to deliver multiple surface-enhancing characteristics on the same device.
 Our proprietary PhotoLink® coating technology (“PhotoLink Technology”) is a versatile, easily applied, coating technology that modifies medical device surfaces by creating covalent bonds between device surfaces and a variety of chemical agents. PhotoLink Technology can impart many performance enhancing characteristics, such as advanced lubricity (slippery) and hemocompatibility (preventing blood clot formation), when bound onto surfaces of medical devices or other biological materials without materially changing the dimensions or other physical properties of devices. 
 PhotoLink Technology reagents can be applied to a variety of substrates. The coating formulations are easily applied to the material surface by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, dipping, spraying, roll-coating or ink-jetting. We continue to expand our proprietary reagent portfolio for use by our customers. These reagents enable our customers to develop novel surface 
 7

features for their devices, satisfying the expanding healthcare industry requirements. We are also continually working to expand the list of materials that are compatible with our surface modification and device drug-delivery reagents. Additionally, we develop coating processes and coating equipment to meet the device quality, manufacturing throughput and cost requirements of our customers.
 The PhotoLink Technology coating process is relatively simple to use and is easily integrated into the customer’s manufacturing operations. In addition, the process does not subject the coated products to harsh chemical or temperature conditions, produces no hazardous byproducts, and does not require lengthy processing or curing time. Further, coatings incorporating the PhotoLink Technology are generally compatible with accepted sterilization processes, so the surface attributes are not lost when the medical device is sterilized.
 Our Serene® hydrophilic coating platform optimizes lubricity and durability while significantly reducing particulates generation. This next-generation, PhotoLink Technology-enabled coating has demonstrated excellent lubricity on a wide range of substrates, and has been used on FDA-cleared coronary, peripheral and structural heart devices. 
 Our device drug-delivery coating technologies allow therapeutic drugs to be incorporated within our proprietary polymer matrices to provide controlled, site-specific release of the drug into the surrounding environment. The drug release can be tuned to elute quickly (within minutes to a few days) or slowly (from several months to over a year), illustrating the wide range of release profiles that can be achieved with our coating systems. On a wide range of devices, drug-eluting coatings can help improve device performance, increase patient safety and enable innovative new treatments. Examples of short-term use drug-delivery devices would include DCB’s and examples of longer-term drug-delivery devices would include drug eluting stents. We work with companies in the medical device and biotechnology industries to develop specialized coatings that allow for the controlled release of drugs from device surfaces. We see at least three primary areas with strong future potential: (1) improving the function of a device which itself is necessary to treat the medical condition; (2) enabling site-specific drug delivery while limiting systemic exposure; and (3) enhancing the biocompatibility of a medical device to ensure that it continues to function over a long period of time.
 Licensing Arrangements
 We commercialize our surface modification coating technologies primarily through licensing arrangements with medical device manufacturers. We believe this approach allows us to focus our resources on further developing new technologies and expanding our licensing activities. Many of our technologies have been designed to allow manufacturers to implement them easily into their own manufacturing processes so customers can control production and quality internally without the need to send their products to a contract manufacturer. We generate the largest portion of our revenue through licensing arrangements. Royalties and license fees represented 48.4%, 43.6% and 43.5% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenue from these licensing arrangements typically includes license fees and milestone payments, minimum royalties, and royalties based on a percentage of licensees’ product sales. We also generate revenue from reagent chemical or medical device product sales to licensees for use in their coating processes. Additionally, under the Abbott Agreement, we have provided worldwide commercialization rights, including a license under certain of our intellectual property, for our SurVeil DCB. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recognized license fee revenue of $13.5 million and $4.4 million related to the Abbott Agreement, which represents a portion of the up-front license fee and strategic milestone received under that agreement.
 The licensing process for our coating technology licenses begins with the customer specifying a desired product feature to be created such as lubricity or drug delivery. Because each device and coating application is unique, we routinely conduct a feasibility study to qualify each new potential product application, often generating commercial development revenue. Feasibility studies can range in duration from several months to a year. After we complete a feasibility study, our customers cannot market their product until they receive regulatory approval. As further described under the caption “Government Regulation,” the regulatory approval process varies in each country and ranges from several months to four or more years. At any time prior to a customer’s commercial launch, a license agreement may be executed granting the licensee rights to use our technology. We often support our customers by providing coating assistance for parts required in animal tests and human clinical trials. Typically, we complete a technology transfer to most customers which enables those customers to apply the coating at their own facilities.
 License agreement terms are generally for a specified number of years or our patent’s life, whichever is longer, although a license generally may be terminated by the licensee for any reason with advance written notice. In cases where the royalty obligation extends beyond the life of the applicable patent, it is because the license also includes rights to our know-how or other proprietary rights. Under these circumstances, the royalty obligation typically continues at a reduced royalty rate for a specified number of years generally tied to the date on which the customer’s product was first sold.

Our license agreements may include certain license fees and/or milestone payments. Substantially all our licensed coatings technology applications are nonexclusive, allowing us to license each technology to multiple customers. Moreover, even exclusive coatings technology licenses generally are limited to a specific “field of use,” allowing us the opportunity to further license technology to other customers. The royalty rate on a substantial number of the coatings agreements has traditionally been in the 2% to 3% range, but there are certain contracts with lower or higher rates. In certain agreements, our royalty is based on an agreed-upon amount per unit. License fees, milestone payments, and the royalty rates are based on various factors, including the licensed product’s or technology’s stage of development, the perceived value of our technology to the customer’s product, the size of the potential market, and whether the arrangement is exclusive or nonexclusive. Our agreements often incorporate a minimum royalty to be paid by the licensee. Royalty payments generally commence one quarter after the customer’s actual product sales occur because of the delay in reporting sales by our licensees. As such, we historically recognized royalty revenue in the quarter that customer royalty payments were due to us. Commencing in fiscal 2019 we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard under which we estimate and recognize sales-based royalty revenue from our coating technology licensees in the same quarter that the underlying customer product sale occurs. 
 We have over 150 licensed product classes (customer products utilizing Surmodics technology) already in the market generating royalties and greater than 100 customer product classes incorporating our technology in various stages of pre-commercialization. We signed 18, 13 and 17 new licenses in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Under our coatings technology license agreements, the responsibility for securing regulatory approval for and ultimately commercializing these products rests with our customers. Our reliance on our customers in this regard and the potential risks to our operations as a result are discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Moreover, we are often contractually obligated to keep the details concerning our customers’ R&D efforts (including the timing of expected regulatory filings, approvals and market introductions) confidential. Our SurVeil DCB license requires us to complete certain activities in order to obtain regulatory approval for the device. Given the significant uncertainty inherent in product development and regulatory approval processes, the expected timing for regulatory approval and commercialization for the products pending regulatory approval can vary greatly.
 Our licensing agreements generally require us to keep our customers’ identities confidential, unless they approve of such disclosure. Licensed customers that allow the use of their name include: Abbott Laboratories and Abbott Vascular, Inc. (together, “Abbott”), Boston Scientific Corporation (“Boston Scientific”), Cook Medical, Cordis Corporation (a subsidiary of Cardinal Health, Inc.), Covidien PLC (a subsidiary of Medtronic), Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Evalve, Inc. (a subsidiary of Abbott), ev3 Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic), Medtronic, OrbusNeich Medical, Inc., and Spectranetics Corporation (a subsidiary
 of Koninklijke Philips N.V.). 
 IN VITRO DIAGNOSTICS SEGMENT
 The Surmodics
 In Vitro Diagnostics (“IVD”) business unit manufactures and sells components for in vitro diagnostic immunoassay and molecular tests and we sell these components to the diagnostic, biomedical research, and life science markets.  These components include protein stabilizers, substrates, antigens, antibodies and surface coatings.
 Immunoassay Diagnostics. An immunoassay is a biochemical test that measures the presence or concentration of a target molecule, or “analyte”, in a biological fluid or sample. Analyte levels are correlated to the patient’s disease state or medical condition to diagnose the presence, absence or severity of disease. Analytes can range from large molecules such as proteins to small molecules such as hormones. Immunoassays are developed and produced using multiple components. The component’s selection and optimization confer the assay quality and performance of the assay in terms of sensitivity and specificity. IVD companies select these critical biochemical and reagent components to meet the assay’s diagnostic specifications. We develop, manufacture and sell high-performing, consistent-quality and stable immunoassay component products to enable our customers’ diagnostic tests to detect the absence or presence of disease.

Molecular Diagnostics - DNA and Protein Immobilization. Both DNA and protein microarrays are useful tools for the pharmaceutical, diagnostic and research industries. During a DNA gene analysis, typically thousands of different probes need to be placed in a pattern on a surface, called a DNA microarray. These microarrays are used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for new drugs, by genome mappers to sequence human, animal or plant genomes, or by diagnostic companies to search a patient sample for disease causing bacteria or viruses. However, DNA does not readily adhere to most surfaces. We have developed various surface chemistries for both DNA and protein immobilization. Protein microarrays are used as diagnostic and research tools to determine the presence and/or quantity of proteins in a biological sample. The most common type of protein microarray is the antibody microarray, where antibodies are spotted onto a surface and used as capture molecules for protein detection.
 The sales cycle for our IVD products generally begins when an IVD company initiates the process to develop a new, or improve a current, diagnostic test. During product development, these companies will look to source the test’s critical components with reagents it produces internally or with reagents from a supplier, such as Surmodics.
 As IVD tests are developed and various reagents are tested, companies will generally seek to optimize the sensitivity (false negative reductions), specificity (false positive reductions), speed (time from sample to results), convenience (ideally as few steps as possible) and cost effectiveness. Upon regulatory approval or clearance, the customer’s diagnostic test can be sold in the marketplace. It may take several years after approval or clearance for the test to achieve peak market share and optimize Surmodics’ revenue.
 Overview of In Vitro Diagnostics Products
 Protein Stabilizers. We offer a full line of stabilization products for the IVD market. These products increase sensitivity, reduce false positive and false negative results, while extending the diagnostic test’s shelf life, thereby producing more consistent assay results. Our stabilization products are ready-to-use, eliminating the in-house manufacturing preparation time and cost of producing stabilization and blocking reagents.
 Substrates. We also provide colorimetric and chemiluminescent substrates to the IVD market under our BioFX® trademark. A substrate is the diagnostic test kit component that detects and signals that a reaction has taken place so that a result can be recorded. Colorimetric substrates signal a positive diagnostic result through a color change. Chemiluminescent substrates signal a positive diagnostic result by emitting light. We believe that our substrates offer a high level of stability, sensitivity and consistency.
 Antigens and Antibodies. Antigens and Antibodies. We are the exclusive distributor in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico (and non-exclusive distributor in Japan) of DIARECT AG’s line of antigens and antibodies. DIARECT produces the majority of these antigens and antibodies using recombinant technology.
 Surface Coatings for Molecular Diagnostic Applications. We offer custom coatings for molecular diagnostic applications, including DNA, RNA and protein microarrays. Our TRIDIA™ surface coatings bind molecules to a variety of surfaces and geometries and may be customized for selectivity using passivating polymers and reactive groups. This proprietary technology immobilizes DNA and protein to adhere to testing surfaces. We offer other surface coatings that improve flow characteristics through membranes and microfluidic channels on diagnostic devices including point-of-care components.

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS
 Research and Development
 Our R&D personnel work to enhance and expand our technology and product offerings in the area of whole-product solutions, drug delivery, surface modification, and IVD through internal scientific investigation and proprietary product development. These scientists and engineers also evaluate external technologies in support of our corporate development activities. Our R&D efforts are all guided by the needs of the markets in which we do business. Additionally, the R&D staff support the business development staff and business units in performing feasibility studies, and providing technical assistance to existing and potential customers. These services, which generate our research, development and other revenue, include optimizing the relevant technologies for specific customer applications, supporting clinical trials, training customers, and integrating our technologies and know-how into customer manufacturing operations and developing whole-product solutions that meet customers’ needs by integrating our coating, medical device and medical device delivery technologies.
 In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, our R&D expenses were $52.9 million, $41.0 million and $31.8 million, respectively. R&D expenses are primarily comprised of research, development, clinical and regulatory activities necessary to design, develop and commercialize our products, as well as costs associated with our research, development and other revenue. We intend to continue investing significantly in R&D to advance our medical device platform technologies, surface modification coatings, device drug delivery and in vitro diagnostic technologies and to expand uses for our technology platforms. We anticipate R&D expenses will continue to be significant in fiscal 2020, primarily related to medical device product development, including our DCB development and related clinical study activities. In addition, we continue to pursue access to products and technologies developed outside the Company to complement our DCB, radial access and/or thrombectomy platforms.
Medical Device Segment
 As treatment technologies become more sophisticated and increasingly leverage minimally invasive techniques, we believe the need for improved medical devices that benefit from surface modification and device drug delivery will continue to grow. We intend to continue our development efforts to expand our proprietary medical device offerings, including advancing our surface modification and device drug-delivery technologies to better meet these needs across multiple medical markets and to capture more of the final product value. Our medical device product development and clinical activities are primarily focused on the peripheral vascular market, where we believe the integration of our surface modification, balloon catheter, thrombectomy and ultra-thin-walled catheter technologies will result in unique devices capable of producing better patient outcomes in complex, difficult-to-treat arterial disease cases. Our product pipeline continues to be bolstered through developing and acquiring medical device technologies and funding development activities, which has included pre-clinical and clinical studies.
 In fiscal 2019, we acquired an early-stage technology to complement our pipeline of medical devices for treatment of PAD. This acquisition, along with our fiscal 2018 acquisition of a thrombectomy device technology as well as our significant investments in our R&D infrastructure, facilities and personnel over the past several years, reflect our ongoing commitment to strengthen our proprietary product pipeline and broaden our capacity for medical device R&D activities. In fiscal 2018, we completed the build-out of an R&D-focused facility which we lease in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. This accomplishment brought together the development teams focused on our DCB, catheter, and thrombectomy platform technologies, as well as our internal regulatory team, in a state-of-the-art R&D facility in order to provide synergies and development efficiencies. Our facility in Ballinasloe, Ireland is focused on the design and manufacture of balloon-based peripheral vascular devices. This facility’s capabilities include balloon forming, extrusion, coating, braiding and assembly of finished products, with sufficient space for future growth. In fiscal 2017, we completed an expansion of R&D and manufacturing clean rooms as well as an analytical lab to support our whole-product solutions strategy. We have continued to develop surface modification coating and DCB chemistry technologies in our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facilities. Our proprietary, whole-product solutions integrate our surface modification coatings, catheter, thrombectomy and balloon technologies and are being developed with a combined team from our U.S. and Irish facilities. In addition to our DCB-platform products, we are executing on our plan to develop and commercialize at least 12 medical device products by the end of fiscal 2023. Additional planned activities include incorporation of our catheter and thrombectomy technology platforms into various other devices intended for the emerging peripheral vascular treatment market as well as initiation of surface modification experiments that improve medical device performance. In addition to proprietary medical device product development, we work with our customers to integrate the best possible surface modification and device drug-delivery technologies with their products, not only to meet their performance requirements, but also to perform services quickly so that the product may reach the market ahead of the competition. To quickly solve problems that might arise during the development and optimization process, we offer extensive capabilities in analytical chemistry and surface characterization within our R&D organization. Our state-of-the-art instrumentation and extensive experience allow us to test the purity of coating reagents, to monitor the elution rate of drug from coatings, to measure coating thickness and smoothness, and to map the distribution of chemicals throughout coatings. We believe our capabilities in this area exceed those of our competitors.

In Vitro Diagnostics Segment
 Our R&D efforts to grow our IVD business unit include identifying and addressing unmet needs that exist in the global IVD marketplace. Our pipeline of IVD products includes components for immunoassay and molecular diagnostic applications, such as, new protein stabilizers, detection technologies, accessory reagents and surface coatings that have the potential to add greater sensitivity, specificity, speed, convenience and lower cost for IVD test manufacturers. 
Clinical Trials
 For our DCB products, which combine a pharmaceutical drug with a medical device, clinical studies are required in order for us to obtain regulatory approval or clearance. Each clinical trial includes a primary endpoint or endpoints, which measure effectiveness and/or safety of a device based on the product’s ability to achieve a pre-specified outcome or outcomes and is selected based on the proposed intended use of the medical device. A pivotal trial is a definitive study designed to gather evidence to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a product prior to its marketing. The following is a summary of our significant clinical trial activities over the past three years.
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we completed enrollment in our PREVEIL first-in-human early feasibility study using the SurVeil DCB. Twelve-month results from PREVEIL indicated that acute success measures of safety were achieved in all patients, as well as 100 percent freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization. In July 2017, we received an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) from the FDA to initiate a pivotal clinical trial of the SurVeil DCB. Enrollment in our randomized clinical trial, TRANSCEND, began in fiscal 2018 and was completed in August 2019. The TRANSCEND trial will provide the data necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our SurVeil DCB compared with the Medtronic IN.PACT® Admiral® DCB in treating PAD in the upper leg. The trial enrolled 446 subjects at 65 global sites. The trial’s primary efficacy endpoint is primary patency, defined as a composite of freedom from restenosis and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months post-index procedure. All randomized subjects will be followed through 60 months post-index procedure. If successful, the TRANSCEND clinical trial data will be used to support regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and Europe. There is no assurance that the TRANSCEND clinical trial will support regulatory approval, or that any anticipated time frame will be met. We estimate that the total cost of the TRANSCEND clinical trial will range between $35 million to $40 million from inception to completion.
 In December 2018, we commenced a first-in-human clinical study of our Avess DCB for treatment of AV fistulae, commonly associated with hemodialysis. We completed enrollment in this 12-patient study in fiscal 2019 and expect to receive safety and efficacy data to support application for a pivotal trial in fiscal 2020.
 In September 2019, we submitted an application for a first-in-human study of our Sundance DCB for treatment of PAD below-the-knee. We expect this study will commence in fiscal 2020.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Patents and other forms of proprietary rights are an essential part of Surmodics’ business. The Company aggressively pursues patent protection covering the proprietary technologies that we consider strategically important to our business. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we also generally file patent applications in European countries and, on a selective basis, other foreign countries. We strategically manage our patent portfolio so as to ensure that we have valid and enforceable patent rights protecting our technological innovations.
 We protect our extensive portfolio of technologies through filing and maintaining patent rights covering a variety of coatings, drug delivery methods, reagents, and formulations, as well as particular clinical device applications. As of September 30, 2019, Surmodics owned or had exclusive rights to 55 pending U.S. patent applications and 148 foreign patent applications. Likewise, as of the same date, Surmodics owned or had exclusive rights to 141 issued U.S. patents and 196 international patents.
 We have licensed our PhotoLink Technology on a non-exclusive basis to a number of our customers for use in a variety of medical device surface applications, including those described above. In particular, we have 28 issued U.S. patents, 9 pending U.S. patent applications, 51 issued international patents, and 23 pending international patent applications protecting various aspects of these technologies, including compositions, methods of manufacture and methods of coating devices. The expiration dates for these patents and anticipated expiration dates of the patent applications range from fiscal 2020 to 2035. Moreover, these patents and patent applications represent distinct families, with each family generally covering a successive generation of the technology, including improvements that enhance coating performance, manufacturability, or other important features desired by our customers. Among these, our fourth-generation of our PhotoLink technology is protected by a family of patents that will expire in 
 12

early fiscal 2020. As noted above in “Licensing Arrangements,” the royalty obligation in our typical license agreement is generally for a specified number of years or the patent life, whichever is longer. In cases where the royalty obligation extends beyond the life of the applicable patent, it is because the license also includes rights to our know-how or other proprietary rights. Under these circumstances, the royalty obligation will continue at a reduced royalty rate for a specified number of years, as determined based on the specific terms and conditions of the applicable customer agreement, generally tied to the date on which the customer’s product was first sold. In recent years, we have successfully converted a number of our customers’ products utilizing this and other early-generation coating technologies to our advanced generation technologies, or extended the royalty-bearing term of their existing technology licenses.
 Royalty revenue associated with our fourth-generation PhotoLink Technologies was approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. In most of the license agreements covering our hydrophilic coating technologies, the customer’s royalty obligations extend, at a reduced rate, beyond expiration of the applicable patent(s) as a result of know-how and other proprietary rights licensed under the agreements.
 We also rely upon trade secrets, trademarks and other un-patented proprietary technologies. We seek to maintain the confidentiality of such information by requiring employees, consultants and other parties to sign confidentiality agreements and by limiting access by parties outside the Company to such information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of this information, or that others will not be able to independently develop such information. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any agreements regarding confidentiality and non-disclosure will not be breached, or, in the event of any breach, that adequate remedies would be available to us.
 Marketing and Sales
 Through our whole-product solutions strategy, we utilize our design, development, manufacturing and regulatory capabilities to provide our customers access to highly differentiated products that address important unmet clinical needs. While medical device product development and manufacturing capability and capacity scale-up have been a significant focus over the past several years, we continue to provide world-class surface modification coating technologies to our medical device customers and sales of our hydrophilic coating reagents and related sales-based royalties continue to account for the majority of the revenue from our Medical Device segment. For our whole-product solutions, we have focused on negotiating license and distribution agreements with our customers that call for revenue from product sales at a specified transfer price and, in certain cases, license fees and sales-based royalties. As we continue to develop and seek regulatory approval for our proprietary medical device products, we expect the majority of revenue growth in the Medical Device business to come from these products.
 Sales and marketing professionals working within our Medical Device business work in concert with our R&D personnel to coordinate commercialization activities for both our surface modification coatings and medical device products. Our sales professionals’ specialization fosters an in-depth knowledge of the issues faced by our customers, such as industry trends, technology changes, biomaterial changes and the regulatory environment. We have signed agreements with third-party distributors to bring our first cleared proprietary medical device products to the market, which we expect to occur in fiscal 2020. Following receipt of 510(k) clearance or CE Mark, we conduct clinical evaluations of our proprietary medical device products in order to generate clinical data and receive important feedback regarding the attributes and performance of our devices from physicians. These evaluations allow us to build the value proposition for each of our products to support successful commercialization.
 With respect to our diagnostics products, our sales professionals sell directly to IVD kit manufacturers and we enter into supply agreements with third parties to distribute those products around the world. We also offer diagnostics products for sale through our website.
 To support our marketing and sales activities, we publish technical literature on our various surface modification, drug delivery, and IVD technologies and products. In addition, we exhibit at major trade shows and technical meetings, advertise in selected trade journals and through our website, and conduct direct mailings to appropriate target markets.
 We also offer ongoing customer service and technical support to our customers. This service and support may begin with a feasibility study, and also may include additional services such as assistance in the transfer of the technology to the customer, further optimization, process control and troubleshooting, preparation of product for clinical studies, and assistance with regulatory submissions for product approval. Some of these services are billable to customers, mainly feasibility and optimization activities.

Significant Customers
 Revenue from Abbott and Medtronic represented approximately 19% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019. Revenue from these customers was generated from multiple products and fields of use, including revenue from the Abbott Agreement, substantially all of which were recognized in our Medical Device segment. No other customer provided more than 6% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2019. Two customers in our IVD business accounted for 19% and 13%, respectively, of our IVD operating segment revenue.
Competition
 Medical Device Segment
 We believe that the intense competition within the medical device market creates opportunities for our technologies as medical device manufacturers seek to differentiate their products through new enhancements or to remain competitive with enhancements offered by other manufacturers. Our PTA balloon catheter and microcatheter products compete with larger original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) suppliers, as well as some of our largest medical device customers. We provide differentiated whole-product solutions that integrate our surface modification, catheter, balloon and other proprietary technologies. We believe our whole-product solutions will be competitive on the basis of their safety and efficacy as a result of the innovative design and differentiated coating and device design technology, which will lead to demonstrated improvements in patient outcomes through reduced invasiveness compared to other devices used for comparable procedures.
 Because a significant portion of our revenue depends on royalties derived from our customers’ medical device product sales incorporating our surface modification coating technologies, we are also affected by competition within the markets for such devices. As we typically license our surface modification coating technologies on a non-exclusive basis, we benefit by offering our technologies to multiple competing manufacturers of a device. However, competition in the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on us. While we seek to license our coatings products to established manufacturers, in certain cases, our surface modification licensees may compete directly with larger, dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. We also are unable to control other factors that may impact commercialization of our whole-product solutions and licensees with medical devices that utilize our surface modification coatings, such as regulatory approval, marketing and sales efforts of our customers and licensees or competitive pricing pressures within the particular market. Many of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have.
 The ability for surface modification coating technologies to improve the performance of medical devices and drugs and to enable new product categories has resulted in increased competition in these markets. Some of our competitors offer device drug-delivery technologies, while others specialize in lubricious or hemocompatible coating technology. Some of these companies target cardiovascular, peripheral or other medical device applications. In addition, because of the many product possibilities afforded by surface modification coating technologies, many of the large medical device manufacturers have developed, or are engaged in efforts to develop, internal competency in the area of surface modification, including drug-delivery technologies. 
 We attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing what we believe is a high value-added approach to device, drug-delivery and surface modification coating technologies. We believe that the primary factors customers consider in choosing a particular technology include performance (e.g., flexibility, ability to fine tune drug elution profiles, biocompatibility), ease of manufacturing, time-to-market, intellectual property protection, ability to produce multiple products from a single process, compliance with manufacturing regulations, ability to manufacture clinical and commercial products, customer service and total cost of goods (including manufacturing process labor). We believe our technologies deliver exceptional performance in these areas, allowing us to compete favorably with respect to these factors. With respect to our licensed surface modification coating technologies, we believe that the cost and time required to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals significantly reduces the likelihood of a customer changing the manufacturing process it uses once a device or drug has been approved for sale.
 In Vitro Diagnostics Segment
 Competition in the diagnostics market is highly fragmented. In the product lines in which we compete (protein stabilization reagents, substrates, antigens and surface chemistry technologies), we face an array of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of products. Some of our competitors have substantially more capital resources, marketing experience, R&D resources and production facilities than we do. We believe that our products compete on performance, stability (shelf life), sensitivity (lower levels detected, faster results), consistency and price. We believe that our continued competitive success will depend on our ability to gain market share, to develop 
 14

or acquire new proprietary products, obtain patent or other protection for our products and successfully market our products directly or through partners.
 Manufacturing
 We manufacture our surface modification and drug-delivery reagents and our IVD products in one of our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facilities. In certain limited circumstances, we also provide contract manufacturing services for our customers, including, for example, coating their medical devices that are intended for pre-clinical and clinical development (including human clinical trials), and products that are sold for commercial use by our customers. We manufacture PTA balloon catheters and microcatheters in our Ballinasloe, Ireland facility, which offers a suite of capabilities, including balloon forming, extrusion, coating, braiding and assembly of finished products. We plan to manufacture substantially all of our whole-product solutions devices in our Ireland facility as the products are launched. Our SurVeil DCB is currently manufactured in one of our Eden Prairie, Minnesota facilities as we scale up our Irish facility for DCB manufacturing. We will maintain secondary, redundant manufacturing capacity in our U.S. facilities once full scale-up has been achieved in our Ireland facility.
 We attempt to maintain multiple sources of supply for the key raw materials used to manufacture our products. We do, however, purchase some raw materials from single sources, but we believe that additional sources of supply are readily available. Further, to the extent additional sources of supply are not readily available, we believe that we could manufacture such raw materials.
 We follow quality management procedures in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance for the development and manufacture of materials and device, biotechnology or combination products that support clinical trials and commercialization. In order to meet our customers’ needs in this area, our manufacturing facility in Eden Prairie, Minnesota is certified to ISO 13485 and ISO 9001. Our manufacturing facility in Ballinasloe, Ireland is certified to ISO 13485. Each of these facilities is registered with the U.S. FDA as a “Contract Manufacturer.” 
 Government Regulation
 Our medical device products and the IVD, third-party device and biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are often required to undergo long, expensive and uncertain regulatory review processes that are governed by the U.S. FDA and other international regulatory authorities. Our strategy for our proprietary medical device products is to obtain regulatory clearance in the U.S and European Union. New medical devices can only be marketed in the U.S. after a pre-market notification for 510(k) clearance or a pre-market approval (“PMA”) by the FDA. These processes can take anywhere from several months (e.g., for medical device products seeking regulatory approval under the 510(k) clearance process) to several years (e.g., for medical device products seeking regulatory approval under the PMA application process). In the European Union, regulatory approval is signified by the CE Mark, which is generally granted by one of the competent authorities and is based on the submission of a design dossier, a manufacturer validation assessment, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a “Notified Body.” In 2017, the European Union authorized new medical device regulation. The new regulation, which will impose significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements, becomes effective for devices submitted for CE Mark after May 2020. Medical devices granted CE Mark prior to May 2020 will require recertification based on the new requirements within five years after the effective date. 
 With respect to our customers’ products that incorporate our surface modification coating and IVD technologies, the burden of securing regulatory approval typically rests with our customers as the medical device manufacturers. With respect to our whole-product solutions, including the SurVeil DCB, our other DCB-platform devices and any additional medical device products that we develop, the burden of securing regulatory approval will rest on us unless we partner with other organizations to pursue such approval.
 In support of our customers’ and our own regulatory filings, we maintain various confidential Device Master Files with the FDA and provide technical information to other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. regarding the nature, chemical structure and biocompatibility of our reagents. Our licensees generally do not have direct access to these files. However, they may, with our permission, reference these files in their various regulatory submissions to these agencies. This approach allows regulatory agencies to understand the details of our technologies without our having to share this highly confidential information with our customers.
 U.S. legislation allows companies, prior to obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a medical product in the U.S., to manufacture medical products in the U.S. and export them for sale in international markets. This generally allows us to realize earned royalties sooner, and may result in opportunities to market our whole-product solutions in other countries. However, sales 
 15

of medical products outside the U.S. are subject to international requirements that vary from country to country. The time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required by the FDA.
 Employees
 As of November 30, 2019, we had 369 employees. Of these employees we employ 151 outside the U.S., primarily in R&D and manufacturing operations functions. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
