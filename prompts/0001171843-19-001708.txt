Overview 
 
XBiotech Inc. (“XBiotech” or the “Company) is a pre-market biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing True Human™ monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. True Human™ monoclonal antibodies are those which occur naturally in human beings—as opposed to being derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. We believe that naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be safer and more effective than their non-naturally occurring counterparts. XBiotech is focused on developing its True Human™ pipeline and manufacturing system.
 
The majority of our efforts to date have been concentrated on developing our lead product candidate, bermekimab (also known as MABp1, Xilonix™, CA-18C3, CV-18C3, RA-18C3, and T2-18C3), a therapeutic antibody which specifically neutralizes interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a). IL-1a is a pro-inflammatory protein produced by leukocytes and other cells, where it plays a key role in inflammation. When unchecked, inflammation can contribute to the development and progression of a variety of different diseases, such as cancer, vascular disease, inflammatory skin disease, and diabetes. Our clinical studies have shown that blocking IL-1a with our lead product candidate may have a beneficial effect on several diseases.
 
In the second quarter of 2018, XBiotech launched a multi-center phase 2, open label, dose escalation clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of bermekimab in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This study was the first to utilize the Company’s new pre-filled syringes to deliver bermekimab therapy via a subcutaneous injection. In 2018, the Company released its first production lot of pre-filled syringes, which contain a highly concentrated formulation of bermekimab, allowing dosing of 400mg in a single, convenient injection. In December 2018, the Company announced topline results from the study which enrolled a total of 38 patients at 9 different dermatology centers across the U.S. Ten patients completed 4 weekly 200mg injections of bermekimab in the low dose group, at which point a safety assessment showed the dose to be well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities. This was followed by enrollment of 28 patients in the high dose cohort, which received 8 weekly 400mg injections of bermekimab. The study met all primary and secondary endpoints and clinically and statistically significant improvement was seen for all clinical endpoints in the high dose group. Results of this study were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology’s (AAD) Annual Meeting held in March 2019 by Eric Simpson, M.D, M.C.R. Professor of Dermatology at Oregon Health & Science University, School of Medicine. The presented findings demonstrated that bermekimab treatment resulted in rapid and significant improvement of disease in patients with moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis. After 7 weeks of treatment, 71% of patients that received a 400mg weekly bermekimab regimen had at least 75% reduction in their disease, as measured by the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. Moreover, within 7 weeks, using patient reported Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for itch and pain, patients receiving the 400mg bermekimab treatment regimen had 71% reduction in itch and an 84% reduction in pain. The Company plans to further pursue clinical development of bermekimab as a treatment for atopic dermatitis.
 
In the third quarter of 2018, the Company announced enrollment of the first patient in a phase 2, open label clinical study to evaluate safety and efficacy of bermekimab in patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). With enrollment rates exceeding expectation, XBiotech announced enrollment completion within the same quarter with a total of 42 patients treated in the study. The study consisted of two treatment groups- those who had failed prior anti-TNF therapy (n=24); and those with no prior anti-TNF treatment history (n=18), all of which received 400mg subcutaneous weekly doses of bermekimab via the Company’s new pre-filled syringes in a 12-week treatment regimen. The study was conducted at eleven different dermatology research centers across the U.S. Bermekimab was well tolerated with no safety concerns. The findings of this study were also recently presented at the AAD annual meeting by Alice Gottlieb, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of the study and Clinical  Professor of Dermatology, Department of Dermatology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The presented findings showed that by week 12 of treatment, 63% of patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy achieved a positive Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score (the accepted measure of disease severity in HS); similarly, 61% of patients with no prior anti-TNF therapy achieved positive HiSCR. These results translated into a 46% (p<0.001) and 60% (p=0.005) mean reduction in the number of abscesses and inflammatory nodules, respectively, for the two groups. Another key finding was that 67% and 72% of patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in pain by week 12. These results confirm previous findings from a completed phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored study evaluating bermekimab for the treatment of HS. The data from this study, which has been published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, is from 20 patients treated with moderate to severe HS that had progressed on standard therapies. Patients received bermekimab for 12 weeks and were followed for an additional 12 weeks to observe durability of treatment. Results demonstrated a response rate in patients treated with bermekimab versus placebo of 60% vs 10%, respectively (p=0.035). The Company plans to further pursue clinical development of bermekimab as a treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa.

An investigator sponsored study that was launched in 2017 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center located in Los Angeles, California for bermekimab to be used in combination with OnivydeⓇ (Irinotecan liposome injection) and 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid for treatment of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma has nearly completed enrollment. Andrew Hendifar, M.D., Principal Investigator of the study, Medical Oncology lead for the Gastrointestinal Disease Research Group at Cedars-Sinai and Co-Director of Pancreas Oncology, is leading the study and has enrolled nearly all 16 patients at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Phase I study will determine a maximum tolerated dose as well as assess efficacy. Other studies with bermekimab in oncology are also being considered and these will be announced if and when further progress is made in these directions. 
 
We have also investigated our lead product candidate in clinical trials for other inflammatory conditions, including vascular disease (which led to fast track designation from the FDA to develop bermekimab as a therapy to reduce the need for re-intervention after treatment of peripheral vascular disease with angioplasty or other endovascular methods of treatment), type II diabetes, acne, psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Data from each of these trials have been published in journals, with the exception of PG. A listing of these publications is included in the Summary of Clinical Findings to Date section of this document.
 
The Company previously conducted a Phase I/II study evaluating dosing, safety and efficacy of its novel antibody, 514G3. 514G3 was developed from a healthy human donor with natural antibodies effective at neutralizing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and non-MRSA forms of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). 514G3 works to eliminate the principle immune evasion mechanism of the bacteria, allowing white blood cells to detect and destroy the bacteria. 514G3 has potential to treat all strains of MRSA and can be used without consideration for strain-specific resistance to various antibiotics. As a True Human monoclonal antibody, 514G3 is expected to be well tolerated without the side effects or risks of antibiotics, including the lack of risk of antibiotic resistance. This proprietary antibody received Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of all forms of S. aureus infections, including Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Top line results from the Phase I/II study were announced in April 2017 and reported a reduction in adverse events and shorter hospitalization associated with the 514G3 therapy, even with 514G3-treated subjects tending to be sicker than those receiving placebo. Pre-clinical research involving 514G3 was published in January 2018 in the journal PLOS ONE in a manuscript titled, “A Natural Human Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Staphylococcus Protein A Protects Against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) Bacteremia.” Throughout 2018, XBiotech continued to reestablish and optimize manufacturing production of 514G3. The Company is continuing to improve yields and processing efficiencies, and to reduce overall cost of production for 514G3 to support its initiatives to potentially use 514G3 as a prophylaxis.
 
In 2017, data was presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions which provided the first evidence that IL-1⍺ is associated with Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and plays a key role in endothelial activation and thrombogenesis. The data stems from a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) signed in 2016 with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in which Dr. Peter Libby, a renowned Cardiovascular medicine specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and the Mallinckrodt Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, was named principal investigator of the research. The study researched the influence of NETs on the endothelial cell (EC) functions related to erosion-associated thrombosis. The data shows that exposure of human saphenous veins ECs (HSVECs) to NETs cause an increase in expression of cell surface adhesions such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which may participate in atherogenesis. In conclusion, it was found that NETs act to increase thrombogenicity in vitro through a response mediated by IL-1⍺. These data suggest a potentially important role for bermekimab therapy in heart disease. Findings from this research were published in August 2018 in a journal of the American Heart Association (AHA), Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, in an article titled, Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Induce Endothelial Cell Activation and Tissue Factor Production Through Interleukin-1α and Cathepsin G. The publication highlights findings that point toward a white blood cell-derived interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1⍺) as a cause of blood clots that could lead to heart attacks or strokes via an intriguing mechanism whereby NETs, released from neutrophils, are laden with IL-1⍺ that is capable of activating cells of the artery wall in a way that in turn activates blood clotting mechanisms and recruits further white blood cells. These published findings not only broaden bermekimab’s potential treatment opportunity in heart disease, but also expands treatment opportunities for other inflammatory diseases in which NETs play a deleterious role, such as cancer and pulmonary, autoimmune and gastrointestinal diseases.

In April 2018, the Company obtained an exclusive worldwide license from a Swiss biotechnology Company for the development of the anti-NY-ESO-1 monoclonal antibody, 12D7. The 12D7 antibody targets NY-ESO-1, a cancer-related protein commonly found in many kinds of aggressive tumors. The therapeutic use of 12D7 offers the potential to target advanced tumors by activating cellular immunity or antibody directed immune responses against tumors. A 12D7 therapy may be combined with other therapies that unleash the immune system to produce anti-cancer responses. The Company made considerable strides in the cell line development of cells producing 12D7. These cells will be scaled up to make parental cell banks and grown for process development purposes. This NYESO-1 antibody has the potential to stimulate the body to produce a highly specific immune response against tumors, and may be used to enhance the specificity and potential efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
 
Our True Human antibody therapeutics are developed in-house using our proprietary discovery platform. Identifying True Human antibodies useful for therapeutics may involve screening thousands of blood donors. To distinguish the clinically relevant antibodies from irrelevant background antibody molecules in donor bloods, we use our Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM™) technology. After we identify donors, we undertake the complex process of identifying the unique genes for producing the native antibody. Once the nucleic acid sequence is isolated, we are able to introduce these sequences into engineered production cells to manufacture large quantities of product candidate for use in humans. All patents and other intellectual property relating to both the composition of matter and methods of use of our True Human antibodies were developed internally by us. We manufacture these antibodies using a proprietary expression system licensed from Lonza Sales AG. The manufacturing process we have developed incorporates both proprietary and non-proprietary technology.
 
In 2018, XBiotech completed consolidation of its operations in its new headquarter facility in Austin, Texas. The Company previously occupied three building locations totaling almost 90,000 square feet of space. Operations are now exclusively housed in a custom-built 33,000 square foot facility that includes a new large scale manufacturing operation, R&D laboratories and administrative space. The move has enabled significant reduction in operating costs while maintaining all R&D and operational capabilities in an improved Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) environment. The new facility is built on a 48 acre property, which is wholly owned by the Company. In December 2018, the Company announced its first successful GMP audit of the new facility by Eurofins Amatsigroup. The audit was conducted in connection with XBiotech’s distribution in Europe of its US-manufactured biological drug product. The Company regularly ships drug product manufactured at the new facility to clinics in various countries in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Drugs manufactured outside of Europe may only be distributed in Europe through a qualified organization that can assure quality of drug product and manufacturing practices (in this case, Amatsigroup). XBiotech currently produces all of its clinical drug material and plans to manufacture any potential commercial drug product from its Austin headquarters.


XBiotech made important advances in its pre-clinical R&D programs in 2018. This includes in vivo work to test and select its lead anti C. difficile antibody candidates that target cell surface antigen of the pathogenic bacterium. The Company has successfully optimized an aggressive initial infection and relapse models to test these antibodies both in a prophylactic and therapeutic manner. The Company also continues to make progress in development of True Human antibodies for the treatment and prevention of influenza by targeting two key surface moieties on influenza, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The Company has identified lead antibodies that bind to several influenza strains within two subgroups of influenza A and is currently in the process of identifying broadly neutralizing antibodies that target both groups. The company has also selected two lead, broadly neutralizing antibodies against neuraminidase protein, and is currently in the process of optimizing antibody expression in CHO to allow for future large-scale manufacture of these antibodies. During 2018, the Company also made progress in its herpes zoster (shingles) discovery program. It has now identified its lead anti-herpes zoster antibody against a surface protein of the virus. This antibody was identified from an initial in vitro assay performed by a clinical research organization, and will be characterized further in house in the year 2019.
 
XBiotech continues to optimize its upstream and downstream manufacturing processes. Considerable manufacturing milestones were achieved in 2018, including an increase in bioreactor media volume to maximize cell culture capacity at harvest, an increase in bioreactor run-time to maximize product yield, and minimization of processing time by streamlining downstream manufacturing processes. In addition, scale up towards achieving full capacity production runs in the current manufacturing facility is planned for 2019. This will include a four-fold increase in syringe output capacity per drug product lot by third quarter 2019.

A Background on Therapeutic Antibodies 
 
A century ago scientists and physicians envisioned being able to custom design therapeutic agents that were highly specific for a single biological target. By selectively attacking disease while sparing healthy tissue, these “magic bullets” were thought to be ideal therapeutic agents. It was not until the early 1970’s, however, that this vision was realized when Kohler and Milstein developed a ground-breaking method for making target-specific monoclonal antibodies—a Nobel prize-winning endeavor. Using this new approach, numerous monoclonal antibody-based research, diagnostic, and therapeutic products have been developed.
 
Kohler and Milstein’s discovery was based on their knowledge that the immune system of higher animals produces antibodies as a method of protecting them from various, potentially damaging, agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and diseased cells. White blood cells, known as B cells, produce billions of different types of antibodies, each with a unique potential to selectively attach to and neutralize different disease targets. The vast array of possible treatments based on antibodies led to the development of what is now a major industry around the use of therapeutic antibodies.
 
True Human™ Antibodies 
 
White blood cells in the human body secrete billions of different antibodies that circulate through the blood to react and protect us from toxins, infectious agents or even other unwanted substances produced by our body. True Human™ antibodies, as the name implies, are simply those that are derived from a natural antibody identified from the blood of an individual. To develop a True Human™ antibody therapy, donors are screened to find an individual that has a specific antibody that matches the desired characteristics needed to obtain the intended medical benefit. White blood cells from that individual are obtained, the unique gene that produced the antibody is cloned, and the genetic information is used to produce an exact replica of the antibody sequence. A True Human™ antibody is, therefore, not to be confused with other marketed antibodies, such as so-called “fully human” antibodies—where antibody reactivity is developed through gene sequence engineering in the laboratory.
Fundamental Science of True Human™ Antibodies 
 
To appreciate the background safety and tolerability of True Human™ antibodies, it is important to consider the fundamental biology of natural antibody production.
 
Billions of different white blood cells secrete billions of unique antibodies every day into circulation. The vast number of different antibodies (and cells that produce them), are essential to enable adequate molecular diversity to ward off a vast range of potential infectious or toxic threats. In other words, since antibodies act to bind and thereby neutralize unwanted agents, any given circulating antibody must be able to react with a potentially limitless number of existing or evolving disease entities.
 
The staggering number of different antibodies needed to achieve this level of preparedness, however, is a daunting concept from a genetics point of view. If an individual antibody gene was needed to encode each of a billion different antibodies, there would be approximately 20,000 times as many genes needed just for antibodies as there would be needed to encode the rest of the entire human genome. Individual cells would need to be gigantic, and monumental resources of the body would be required to make, copy and maintain all of the DNA. Clearly, the system of antibodies could not have evolved to protect us, had not an elegant solution emerged to deal with this genetic conundrum.


Thus, a hallmark of the immune physiology of all vertebrates (all have antibodies) is the ability to recombine and selectively mutate a relatively small number of gene segments to create a phenomenal and effectively unlimited number of antibody genes. By rearranging, recombining and mutating the genetic code, specialized white blood cells, or B lymphocytes, are able to create an unlimited array of antibody genes. The consequence of this genetic engineering, however, is that each antibody gene is unique to the individual B lymphocyte that created it—and no copy of the gene exists in the human germline. The only place to find a unique antibody gene is in the individual cells that created it.
 
The extraordinary process of gene rearrangement and mutation results in a multitude of unique B lymphocytes and consequently an incredibly diverse repertoire of antibodies in any given individual.
 
Elucidating the mechanisms behind the production of unique antibody genes must be considered one of the major achievements of medical research in the 20th century. Yet unfolding this mystery created another problem to solve: If antibodies were not produced from genes encoded in the human genome and the products of these genes were new to the body, why were these antibody molecules not recognized by the immune system as foreign substances—like any other foreign substance that they were intended to eradicate? How could the body distinguish the apparently “foreign” antibody molecules from the bona fide infectious intruders?

Unraveling the genetics of antibody production led to another major advance in medicine: the discovery of how an endless array of antibody proteins could be made in a way that individual molecules were always tolerated by the body.
 
In the early 1990s, research began to demonstrate that the production of antibodies was not an unregulated process. Rather, it was learned that the antibodies produced by each and every B lymphocyte were subject to intense scrutiny. Studies showed that B lymphocytes which produced acceptable antibodies were stimulated to grow while those that produced “autoreactive” antibodies were not. B lymphocytes that produced “good” antibodies were stimulated to proliferate, and enabled to produce copious amounts of antibody in the event it was needed to ward off a harmful agent. B lymphocytes that rearranged genes to produce antibodies that were ineffective or were autoreactive were given signals that instructed them to engage in a process of programmed cell death. Thus B lymphocytes producing harmful or useless antibodies are simply killed off. This mechanism for creating antibody diversity on the one hand, while protecting the individual from a mass of unwanted or intolerable antibody molecules on the other, was as elegant as it was fundamental to the success of vertebrate immune physiology.
 
This process of “selection” has been elucidated in great detail. There can be no more important feature of immune physiology than the process of selection. Selection is a fundamental step to enable the body to produce an extremely diverse set of antibody molecules without, in the process, producing an array of novel molecules that cause harm.
 
Industry Context 
 
Until now each and every therapeutic antibody on the market has been derived from animals and/or through gene sequence modification in the laboratory to produce a desired antibody reactivity. Marketed antibodies to date, described as “fully human”, are not derived from human gene sequences that have undergone the crucial process of selection in a human.
 
Without exception, all marketed products to date that are described as “fully human”, are in fact engineered and are not selected based on natural tolerance in the human body. The use of the term “fully human” to describe these products has thus created considerable confusion. To our knowledge, there are at present no True Human™ antibodies manufactured, using recombinant protein technology, currently marketed. If successful in clinical development, our lead product candidate is expected to be the first True Human™ therapeutic antibody to be commercialized.
 
Platform Technology 
 
Our True Human antibody therapeutics are developed in-house using our proprietary discovery platform. There are significant technical challenges in identifying and cloning genes for True Human™ antibodies. A key problem to overcome can be to first identify individuals with the desired antibody reactivity. This can involve screening thousands of blood donors to enable the identification of a single, clinically relevant antibody—discovered from literally trillions of irrelevant background antibody molecules in the blood of donors. To distinguish the clinically relevant antibodies from irrelevant background antibody molecules in donor bloods, we use our Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM™) technology. White blood cells from that individual can then be isolated, and the unique gene that produced the native antibody obtained. We currently obtain blood donor samples through a Research and Collaboration Agreement with the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. See "Intellectual Property- Other Commercial Licenses."


Novel cloning technologies developed at XBiotech have enabled us to clone the crucial antibody gene sequences from these donors in order to reproduce a True Human™ antibody for use in clinical therapy. A True Human™ monoclonal antibody should therefore not be confused with other marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as those currently referred to as “fully human” antibodies.
 
Market Opportunity 
 
We have a number of indications in various stages of clinical or pre-clinical development with significant market opportunities. These include dermatology, oncology and other inflammatory conditions, as well as infectious disease indications. The potential market opportunities in these various indications are vast and we believe our research and manufacturing technologies, designed to more rapidly, cost-effectively and flexibly produce new therapies, will be advantageous in each market space.

Competition 
 
The therapeutic antibody space is dynamic as there continues to be a highly active commercial pipeline of therapeutic antibodies globally, involving a complex array of development cycles as products reach the end of their patent life and as new candidate products proceed into pivotal studies and approach registration. There are numerous independent reviews on the subject in both trade journals and academic press (one such example being Reichert JM, Antibodies to watch in 2018 MAbs. 2018 Jan 4:1-21).
 
We believe True Human™ therapeutic antibodies have important differentiating factors from other monoclonal antibodies currently marketed. The unique activity of our lead anti-cancer therapeutic has the potential ability to both improve well-being and extend life. We feel our product candidates will be highly differentiated in the market place for therapeutics in various indications including but not limited to cancer and dermatology. However, regardless of the potential advantages or uniqueness of our lead product candidate in the market, we do expect these products to compete head-to-head with the numerous existing candidate antibody products in development, including emerging biosimilar therapeutic antibodies.
 
Current Clinical and/or Regulatory Activity 
 
Phase II Study for Atopic Dermatitis (AD)
 
The Company recently completed a phase 2, open label, multi-center clinical study to evaluate safety and efficacy of bermekimab in patients with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD). Thirty eight patients in two treatment groups received a low (n=10) or high (n=28) dose of bermekimab once weekly for either a 4 or 7-week treatment regimen, respectively. The study met all primary and secondary endpoints and clinically and statistically significant improvement was seen for all clinical endpoints in the high dose group. Study findings demonstrated that bermekimab treatment resulted in rapid and significant improvement of disease in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. After only 7 weeks of treatment, 71% of patients that received a 400mg weekly bermekimab regimen had at least 75% reduction in their disease, as measured by the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score. Moreover, within 7 weeks, using patient reported Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for itch and pain, patients receiving the 400mg bermekimab treatment regimen had 71% reduction in itch and an 84% reduction in pain. The Company plans to further pursue clinical development of bermekimab as a treatment for atopic dermatitis.


Phase II Study for Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)
 
The Company recently completed a phase 2, open label, multi-center clinical study to evaluate safety and efficacy of bermekimab in patients with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The study enrolled 42 patients at eleven different dermatology clinics in the U.S., each receiving 400mg subcutaneous weekly subcutaneous doses of bermekimab in a 12-week treatment regimen. There were two treatment groups: those who had failed prior anti-TNF therapy (n=24); and those with no prior anti-TNF treatment history (n=18). Bermekimab was well-tolerated with no safety concerns. Statistically significant improvement was seen for all efficacy endpoints in both groups, with the exception of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in the anti-TNF naïve group (using an alpha level of .05 (5%)). Study results showed that by week 12 of treatment, 63% of patients who have previously failed anti-TNF therapy achieved a positive HiSCR (the accepted measure of disease severity in HS); similarly, 61% of patients with no prior anti-TNF therapy achieved positive HiSCR. These results translated into a 46% (p<0.001) and 60% (p=0.005) reduction in the number of abscesses and inflammatory nodules, respectively, for the two groups. Another key finding was that 67% and 72% of patients achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in pain by week 12.
 
These results confirm previous findings from a completed phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-sponsored study evaluating bermekimab for the treatment of HS. The data from this study, which has been published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, is from 20 patients treated with moderate to severe HS that had progressed on standard therapies. Patients received bermekimab for 12 weeks and were followed for an additional 12 weeks to observe durability of treatment. Results demonstrated a response rate in patients treated with bermekimab versus placebo of 60% vs 10%, respectively (p=0.035). The Company plans to further pursue clinical development of bermekimab as a treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa.

Phase I Pancreatic Cancer Combination Study 
 
An investigator sponsored study that was launched in 2017 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center located in Los Angeles, California for bermekimab to be used in combination with OnivydeⓇ (Irinotecan liposome injection) and 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid for treatment of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma has nearly completed enrollment. Andrew Hendifar, M.D., Principal Investigator of the study, Medical Oncology lead for the Gastrointestinal Disease Research Group at Cedars-Sinai and Co-Director of Pancreas Oncology, is leading the study and has enrolled nearly all 16 patients at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Phase I study will determine a maximum tolerated dose as well as assess efficacy. Other studies with bermekimab in oncology are also being considered and these will be announced if and when further progress is made in these directions. 
Summary of Clinical Findings to Date
 
Safety 
 
Our lead product under development is derived from a natural human immune response. We expected that this would facilitate better tolerability when used as a therapeutic compared to humanized or “fully human” monoclonal antibodies. Antibody therapies are known to be associated with significant risk for infusion reactions, including serious anaphylactic reactions. We believe that these reactions are the result of using antibodies that were not derived from natural human immunity but rather had engineered specificities. Based on scientific principles of antibody physiology, a fundamentally important premise was that our True HumanTM antibody therapy should be safer and result in less infusion-related complications than engineered human antibodies when used in clinical studies.
 
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, even those so-called “fully human,” have been associated with infusion reactions. Comparably administration of our lead product candidate is associated with a reduced number of infusion related reactions and injection site reactions.
 
To date the Company has 9 publications from 7 of its clinical studies. The table below outlines each of these publications.
