(1)OCEAN TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT
     Ocean Freight Services:
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following services:
     Ocean Transportation Services:
     Hawaii Service:  Matson’s Hawaii service provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California; Seattle, Washington; and Honolulu, Hawaii.  Matson also operates a network of inter-island barges that provide connecting services from Honolulu, Hawaii to other major ports on the Hawaiian islands of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii.  Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.
     Westbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, building materials, automobiles and household goods.  Matson’s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities and livestock.  The majority of Matson’s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight and automobiles.
     Alaska Service:  Matson’s Alaska service provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off and conventional services) between the port of Tacoma, Washington, and the ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska.  Matson also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska, and other transportation services to smaller locations in Alaska.
     Northbound cargo to Alaska includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, household goods and automobiles.  Southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of seafood, household goods and automobiles.
     China Service:  Matson’s expedited China-Long Beach Express (“CLX”) service is part of an integrated service that carries cargo from Long Beach, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, to Guam, and then to Okinawa, Japan.  The vessels continue to the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged primarily in Long Beach, California.  These vessels also carry cargo destined for Hawaii which originated in Guam, Micronesia, Japan and China. Matson provides container transshipment services between the CLX ports and many locations in Asia including Hong Kong and Xiamen, China.  
     Eastbound cargo from China to Long Beach, California consists mainly of garments, footwear and other retail merchandise.  Westbound cargo to China and other destinations in Asia consists mainly of recycled materials.
     Guam Service:  Matson’s Guam service provides weekly services between the U.S West Coast and Guam, as part of its expedited CLX service.  Matson also provides weekly connecting service from Guam to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  These services carry cargo similar to the Hawaii service described above. 
     Japan Service:  Matson’s Japan service provides services to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan, as part of its expedited CLX service.  This service carries mainly general sustenance cargo and household goods supporting the U.S. military.
     Micronesia Service:  Matson’s Micronesia service provides services between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.  Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped through Guam and consists of mainly general sustenance cargo.  Matson also operates a direct service between Honolulu, Hawaii and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands with a U.S. flagged vessel.  This service carries mainly general sustenance cargo, construction materials, and household goods supporting the U.S. military.

 South Pacific Service:  Matson’s New Zealand Express (“NZX”) service provides services carrying general sustenance cargo between Auckland, New Zealand and the South Pacific islands, including Fiji (Suva and Lautoka), Samoa (Apia), American Samoa (Pago Pago), the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki), Tonga (Nukualofa and Vava’u), and Niue.  Matson’s NZX service also provides transshipment services to the islands of Tahiti, Vanuatu, Nauru and the Solomon Islands (Honiara).  Additionally, Matson also provides slotting arrangements for the transportation of cargo from major ports on the east coast of Australia to ports in the South Pacific islands.  The NZX service also distributes and sells domestic bulk fuel to a variety of these islands.
     Matson also provides a bi-weekly South Pacific Express (“SPX”) service that connects the U.S. West Coast to ports in the South Pacific islands.  Cargo destined for these ports is transshipped from the U.S. West Coast on Matson’s Hawaii and CLX services to a Matson SPX vessel in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The SPX vessel then transports the cargo to ports in the South Pacific islands including Tahiti (Papeete), American Samoa (Pago Pago), Samoa (Apia) and Tonga (Nukualofa).  Commencing September 2018, the SPX service also provides a bi-monthly service to Christmas Island (Kiritimati) in the Republic of Kiribati.  Cargo destined for other ports is transshipped to Matson’s South Pacific service at the port of Apia, Samoa.  SPX cargo originating in the South Pacific destined for Hawaii or other locations on the U.S. West Coast is shipped to Honolulu, Hawaii, and then transshipped on Matson vessels to the U.S. West Coast. 
     Terminal and Other Related Services: 
     Matson provides container stevedoring, refrigerated cargo services, inland transportation, container equipment maintenance and other terminal services (collectively “terminal services”) for MatNav at terminals located on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai; and in the Alaska terminal locations of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.  Matson also provides terminal services for other ocean carriers at the Alaska terminal locations of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor. 
     Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture SSAT provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at seven terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast and to MatNav at four of those facilities, which are Long Beach and Oakland, California; and Seattle and Tacoma, Washington.  
     Matson utilizes the services of other third-party terminal operators at all of the other ports at which its vessels call. 
     Vessel Management Services:  
     Matson contracts with the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide vessel management services to manage and maintain three Ready Reserve Force vessels on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration.     Recent Ocean Transportation Acquisition:  
     On May 29, 2015, Matson completed its acquisition of Horizon Lines, Inc. (“Horizon”).  As a result, Matson acquired Horizon’s Alaska operations and assumed all of Horizon’s non-Hawaii assets and liabilities.       Matson’s Vessel and Equipment Information:
     Vessels:
     Matson’s fleet includes both owned and chartered vessels.  Matson’s owned vessels represent an investment of approximately $1.5 billion.  The majority of Matson’s owned vessels are U.S. flagged and Jones Act qualified vessels, and operate in the Hawaii, Guam, Japan, China and Alaska services.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, Matson launched MV Daniel K. Inouye, the largest Jones Act container vessel ever built in the U.S.  Matson’s non-U.S. flagged vessels operate in the Micronesia and South Pacific services.

      Hawaii Fleet Renewal Program:        Matson is investing approximately $0.9 billion in the construction of four new vessels to renew its Hawaii fleet and phase-out the use of older steamships that are near the end of their useful life.  The first Aloha Class containership, MV Daniel K. Inouye, was delivered on October 31, 2018 and commenced active service in November 2018.  Expected delivery dates and specifications of the remaining three vessels currently under construction are as follows:

(1) | The Aloha Class container vessel is being constructed by Philly Shipyard, Inc. (“Philly Shipyard”), with a dual-fuel, liquefied natural gas capable engine.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The two new Kanaloa Class combination container and roll-on/roll-off (“Con-Ro”) vessels are being constructed by General Dynamics NASSCO (“NASSCO”), with dual-fuel, liquefied natural gas capable engines.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The new vessels are expected to have among the lowest operating cost per TEU capacity of any vessel in the U.S. domestic trades.  The cost efficiencies are expected to be driven by increased vessel utilization and by significantly lower fuel consumption, maintenance and repair, and dry-docking costs.  Matson also expects to return to an optimal nine vessel Hawaii fleet deployment once MV Lurline is in service.  In addition, the new vessels will provide increased capacity over the older vessels that are being replaced. 
     Actual paid and expected remaining vessel construction obligations based on signed agreements and change orders, excluding owners’ items and capitalized interest, are as follows:
    
 | Paid | | Outstanding Obligations | | 
Vessel Construction Obligations (in millions) | 2018 and Prior | | 2019 | | 2020 | Total
Two Aloha Class Container Vessels | $ | 386.9 | | $ | 20.7 | $ | 3.9 | $ | 411.5

Total | $ | 677.6 | | $ | 188.9 | $ | 61.7 | $ | 928.2

      Hawaii Terminal Expansion and Modernization Program:
     Matson is in the process of renovating its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii.  The first phase involves the investment of approximately $60 million and includes the installation of three new 65 long-ton capacity gantry cranes and modifications to upgrade three existing cranes.  The first phase also includes upgrades in electrical infrastructure and other modifications to the Sand Island terminal.  The first phase is expected to be completed during 2020.  
     Additional phases will be completed in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe and will be part of a broader terminal expansion and modernization program that Matson is undertaking at its Sand Island terminal. 
     Equipment:
     As a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson has a variety of equipment including cranes, containers and chassis which represents an investment of approximately $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2018.  Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements.
     Additional information about Matson’s fleet equipment is as follows:

 | | Approx. % | | Approx. % | 
Fleet Equipment | Total (1) | Owned (1) | | Leased (1) | 
Chassis | 22,200 | 51 | % | 49 | %

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Specialty equipment includes auto frames, flat racks, insulated containers, open top containers, platforms, flat bed trailers and tanks.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Operating Costs:
     Major components of Ocean Transportation operating costs are as follows:
     Direct Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs, purchased outside transportation and other related costs.  
     Vessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs; fuel consumption, pilot, tugs and line related costs; vessel charter expenses; and other vessel related expenses.  Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations and also pays fuel surcharges to other third party transportation providers.
    
 
  5


 

 Operating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment operating lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead.
     Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards established by U.S. Coast Guard rules and classification society requirements.  These standards require vessels to undergo two dry-docking inspections within a five-year period.  The majority of Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels used in the Hawaii service are enrolled in the U.S. Coast Guard’s Underwater Survey in Lieu of Dry-docking (“UWILD”) program.  The UWILD program allows eligible vessels to meet their intermediate dry-docking requirement with a less costly underwater inspection.
     Matson is responsible for ensuring that its non-U.S flagged owned and bareboat chartered vessels meet international standards for seaworthiness, which among other requirements generally mandate that Matson perform two dry-docking inspections every five years.  The dry-dockings of Matson’s time chartered vessels are the responsibility of the vessel owners.
     Competition:
     The following is a summary of major competitors in Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment:
     Hawaii Service: Matson’s Hawaii service has one major U.S. flag Jones Act ocean carrier competitor, Pasha Hawaii (“Pasha”), which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California to Hawaii.  There also are two U.S. flag Jones Act barge operators, Aloha Marine Lines and Sause Brothers, which offer barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.
     Foreign-flag vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii.  Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo.  Air freight competition for time-sensitive and perishable cargo exists; however, inroads by such competition in terms of cargo volume are limited by the amount of cargo space available in passenger aircrafts and by the cost of air freight transportation.
     Matson vessels are operated on schedules that provide customers, shippers and consignees fixed day-of-the-week sailings from the U.S. West Coast as well as fixed day-of-the-week arrivals in Hawaii.  Matson offers four westbound sailings per week, though this amount may be adjusted according to seasonal demand and market conditions.  One of Matson’s westbound sailings each week continues on to Guam, Japan and China, so the number of eastbound sailings direct from Hawaii to the U.S. Mainland is three per week.  This service is attractive to customers because more frequent sailings permit customers to reduce inventory carrying costs.  Matson also competes by offering a more comprehensive service to customers, including: service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast provided by Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture partner SSAT; a dedicated inter-island barge network; an award winning customer service team; and its efficiency and experience in handling cargo of all types.
     Alaska Service:  Matson’s Alaska service has one major U.S. flag Jones Act competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska.  There are also two U.S. flag Jones Act barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines, which mainly provides services from Seattle, Washington to the main ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug & Barge, which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations.  The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers. Foreign-flag vessels provide alternatives for companies shipping cargo (mainly seafood) from the Alaska ports of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.
     Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled services from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska and weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a weekly barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood. Matson offers dedicated terminal services at the Alaska ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor performed by MatNav, and at the port of Tacoma, Washington performed by Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture partner SSAT.

 China Service: Major competitors to Matson’s China service include large international carriers such as Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM and its subsidiary APL, Evergreen, China COSCO, ONE (including “K” Line, NYK Line and MOL), OOCL, Hyundai and SM Line.
     Matson competes by offering a fast and reliable service from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China to Long Beach, California, providing fixed day arrivals and next-day cargo availability.  Matson’s service is further differentiated by offering a dedicated marine terminal in Long Beach, California provided by Matson’s Terminal Joint Venture partner SSAT, an off-dock container yard providing fast truck turn times, and one-stop intermodal connections, and providing state-of-the-art technology and world-class customer service.  Matson has offices in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai.
     Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service has one major competitor, APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged container feeder service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea.  Waterman operates a roll-on/roll-off service which periodically calls at Guam.  There are also several foreign carriers that call at Guam from foreign origin ports.
     Japan Service:  Matson’s Japan service competes primarily with APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the Port of Naha, Okinawa, Japan.
     Micronesia and the South Pacific Services: Matson’s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.
     Customer Concentration:  
     Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo.  In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 24 percent, 23 percent and 24 percent of the Company’s Ocean Transportation revenue, respectively.  None of these customers individually account for more than 10 percent of Matson’s Ocean Transportation operating revenues.  For additional information on Ocean Transportation revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.     Seasonality:
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation services typically experience seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters.  This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade.  As a result, earnings tend to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons while freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.     Maritime Laws and the Jones Act:
     Maritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).
     The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy.  Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens.  U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members.  Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited.

 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 72 percent of Matson’s Ocean Transportation revenues came from the Hawaii and Alaska trades that were subject to the Jones Act.  Matson’s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market.  Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska due to its geographical location, are both dependent on ocean transportation.  The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations.  Matson’s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified.
     Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (“AMP”) which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws.  The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress.  Matson believes that the ongoing war on terrorism has further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support.  AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws.  Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flag vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations.
     Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built.
     Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 90 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services.  Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions.
     Regulations:        Rate Regulations and Fuel Surcharge: Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates.  A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index.  Matson generally provides a 30-day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and terminal handling charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible.
     Matson applies a fuel surcharge rate to its Ocean Transportation customers.  Changes in the fuel surcharge levels are correlated to prevailing market rates for bunker fuel prices along with other factors related to fuel expense recovery.  
     Other Regulations:  Matson’s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S. foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”).  The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of ocean-borne international transportation of the U.S. 
     Environmental Regulations:  
     Being a leader in environmental stewardship and contributing positively to the communities in which we live and work are core values at Matson.  Matson’s vessels transit through some of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the United States including the Hawaiian islands and the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  Matson is focused in particular on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and truck efficiency, and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions.  Matson further contributes positively to the environment by testing and deploying cutting edge technologies which are applied to our modernized fleet.  
     Vessel Emissions Regulations:  The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping.  Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO has imposed a worldwide regulation that requires all vessels to burn compliant fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of 0.5 percent.  With respect to North America, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) received approval from the IMO, in coordination with Environment Canada, to designate all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coast lines as designated emission control areas (“ECAs”).  Beginning January 1, 2015, EPA regulations reduced the maximum sulfur emissions permitted in designated ECAs from 1.0 percent to 0.1 percent.

     Matson’s three diesel-powered vessels in its Alaska service operate a substantial portion of their voyages in ECAs.  Matson successfully installed exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as “scrubbers”) on these vessels to be in compliance with the IMO and EPA ECA regulations.
     Matson’s Hawaii and CLX vessels operate a portion of their voyages in ECAs.  Matson’s four new Hawaii vessels can burn low sulfur fuels enabling the vessels to be compliant with the new IMO and EPA ECA regulations.  Following the delivery of MV Lurline in the fourth quarter of 2019, Matson expects to phase out the use of all three remaining steamships by the end of 2019.  In addition, Matson has announced plans to install scrubbers on three additional diesel-powered vessels used in the Hawaii and CLX services to be completed during 2019 and early 2020.  Matson continues to develop solutions and apply other operating strategies to comply with emissions regulations on its other vessels in use in the Hawaii and CLX services, and other services.
     Other Environmental Regulations: Matson’s operations are required to comply with other environmental regulations and requirements including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act.  The Company actively monitors its operations to ensure compliance with these and other regulations.

     Operating Costs:
     Matson Logistics’ operating costs primarily consist of the costs of purchased transportation, leases of warehouses and other facility operating costs, salaries and benefits, and other operating overhead.      Competition:
     Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services.  The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. 
     Matson Logistics’ transportation brokerage services competes most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, the Hub Group, and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as J.B. Hunt.  Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; real-time visibility into the movement of customers’ goods; and other technology solutions.  Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo.
     Matson Logistics’ freight forwarding services compete most directly with a variety of freight forwarding companies that operate within Alaska including Carlile, Lynden, American Fast Freight and Alaska Traffic Company.
     Customer Concentration:
     Matson Logistics serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations.  In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s 10 largest logistics customers accounted for approximately 23 percent, 19 percent and 22 percent of Matson Logistics’ revenue, respectively.  None of these customers individually account for more than 10 percent of Matson Logistics’ operating revenues.  For additional information on Logistics revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.     Seasonality:
     Matson’s Logistics services are generally not significantly impacted by seasonality factors, except for its freight forwarding service to Alaska which is affected by the winter weather, the cyclical nature of the oil and construction industries, and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry.
C. | EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
---+------------------------------

      Employees:
     As of December 31, 2018, Matson and its subsidiaries had 2,007 employees, of which 786 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with shoreside and offshore unions.  These numbers do not include billets on vessels discussed below, employees of SSAT, or other non-employees, such as agents, temporary workers and contractors.
     Matson’s active fleet employed seagoing personnel in 339 billets at December 31, 2018.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  These amounts exclude billets related to two reserve vessels as of December 31, 2018 and Matson’s foreign flagged chartered vessels where the vessel owner is responsible for its seagoing personnel.  Matson’s vessel management services also employed personnel in 28 billets at December 31, 2018.
     Bargaining Agreements:
     Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (“PMA”), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (“ILWU”) on the U.S. Pacific Coast.  The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore

labor.  In August 2017, the ILWU agreed to extend its contract with the PMA to July 1, 2022.  Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with other unions that expire at various dates in the future.
     Matson’s seagoing employees are represented by unions for both unlicensed and licensed crew members.  Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future.
     Certain collective bargaining agreements expire during 2019.  While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements with its various unions as they expire without any significant impact on its operations, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lock-out or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson’s operations.
     Multi-employer Pension and Post-retirement Plans:
     Matson contributes to a number of multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans.  Matson has no present intention of withdrawing from, and does not anticipate the termination of any of the multi-employer pension plans that it contributes to (see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under certain multi-employer pension plans).
